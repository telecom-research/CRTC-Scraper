There is a need to review them again, given these services\u2019 rapid, pervasive and unrelenting evolution.", "6 Five years after the last review, we are now living in a digital age in which online services and wireless communications are an ever-growing importance in the lives of Canadians. They allow Canadians to keep in touch with one another, of course, but they also provide access to a wide range of online services, including health, educational, banking and government services.", "7 Given the development in this area in recent years, our objective for the hearing is to identify what has changed in terms of telecommunications services. This will enable us to determine whether the new reality warrants the CRTC\u2019s intervention and, if so, what form this intervention should take. For example, the current regulations will be examined to see if they are still appropriate, whether they need to be modified or if new ones need to be created.", "11 The CRTC must therefore take these players, and many others, into consideration when it reviews basic telecommunications services. Our role is clear and framed legislatively, and our jurisdiction is defined by the Telecommunications Act. It is only by taking into account the stated policy objectives, our own jurisdiction and the evidence submitted to us that we can ultimately make an informed decision.", "12 It was from this perspective and by taking into account the diverse range of players that the CRTC established the original objective for basic service, for example, or for the service improvement plans for telephone service providers.", "13 It was also through this same lens that the CRTC approved the use by major telecommunications service providers of deferral accounts to extend their broadband internet services to a greater number of rural and remote communities. Between 2010 and 2015, this initiative extended broadband access to more than 280 additional rural and remote communities.", "17 The CRTC must make informed decisions, based on solid evidence, while taking into account the real and reasonable needs of the population; the real and reasonable needs of the population.", "18 It must also consider the anticipated outcomes and the market\u2019s ability to adapt, given the available resources.", "19 As it is crucial not to confuse \u201cwants\u201d with \u201cneeds\u201d, the CRTC is asking parties to make a fact-based and objective approach to these discussions. As an administrative tribunal, the CRTC\u2019s role is to give parties and panel members an opportunity to test and challenge points of view in an open and transparent proceeding.", "20 Some parties have said that broadband is a fundamental human right. Addressing such a statement goes well beyond our legislative mandate.", "21 The CRTC does plan, however, to use this hearing to determine what level of telecommunications services could be deemed to be basic services, basic services that Canadians should be reasonably expected and able to receive.", "22 The CRTC therefore issues the following challenge to the parties: ", "23 Demonstrate to us, using evidence, that the public interest and the specific situation in each region justifies action by the CRTC; explain to us why market forces are currently insufficient to respond to the public\u2019s needs; needs not wants.", "27 Many people are following our activities closely on social media. This is the ideal opportunity to be heard and express your opinions, so that they are among the points of view that will be included in the public record. ", "28 I would also like to point out that comments posted on Twitter or through a blog will not form part of the public record. So if you have views, we\u2019ve provided you a forum to use. ", "29 Finally I would like to make a few introductions. The Panel consists of the following Peter -- people: Peter Menzies, Vice-Chairman of telecommunications, Candice Molnar, Regional Commissioner for Manitoba and Saskatchewan; Linda Vennard, Regional Commissioner for Alberta and the North-West Territories; Christopher MacDonald, Regional Commissioner for the Atlantic and Nunavut and myself, Jean-Pierre Blais, Chairman of the CRTC and I will be chairing this hearing.", "30 The Commission\u2019s team assisting us includes John Macri, Christine Bailey and Sarah O\u2019Brien, hearing Co-Managers; Emilia de Somma and Amy Hamley, legal counsel and Jade Roy, hearing Secretary. ", "31 I will now ask the hearing Secretary to explain the procedure we will be following. ", "34 When you are in the hearing room, we would ask that you please turn off your smart phones as they are an unwelcomed distraction and they cause interference on the internal communication systems used by our translators. ", "35 We would appreciate your cooperation in this regard throughout the hearing. ", "38 Just a reminder that pursuant to section 41 of the rules of practice and procedures, you must not submit evidence at the hearing unless it supports statements already on the public record.", "39 If you wish to introduce new evidence and an exception to this rule you must ask permission of the Panel of the hearing before you do so.", "40 Please note that if parties undertake to file information with the Commission in response to questioning by the Panel, these undertakings will be confirmed on the record through the transcript of the hearing. ", "41 If necessary, parties may speak with Commission legal counsel at a break following their presentation to confirm their undertakings. ", "42 For the record, please note that we are putting on the record Exhibit 1 entitled \u201cbandwidth requirements for popular internet applications\u201d, which Panel members may be referring to during their questioning. Copies are available in the examination room and they will be soon also available on the web.", "43 And now we will begin with a presentation by Government of Yukon. Please introduce yourself and your colleagues and you have 15 minutes. ", "PRESENTATION", "44 MR. PRATT: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Commissioners. My name is Jim Pratt. I\u2019m a consultant to the Yukon Government. ", "45 With me from the Government of Yukon Economic Development is Steve Sorkin, who is the Director of technology and telecommunications policy.", "46 And before I begin I would like to, on behalf of ourselves and any of our northern colleagues who may be in the room, to let you know that we certainly appreciate the white northern welcome that has been provided for us here. ", "47 Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commission, we are very pleased to have the opportunity to address you on matters of what we believe are of critical importance to current and future Yukoners, and to many others in Canada. ", "48 This proceeding represents a crucial opportunity to further the goals of Canadian telecom policy and specifically to establish a program that will enable all Canadians-in every corner of the country-to fully participate in the digital economy.", "49 The Government of Yukon has been actively engaged in telecom policy matters, including many appearances before the Commission, for more than 15 years. ", "50 Looking back on some of our submissions, it is remarkable how many of our policy priorities remain relevant and indeed useful for this present proceeding.", "51 Of the original principles, the following statements effectively frame our position here.", "52 First, meeting the need for access should be considered the top priority, one that is too important to leave to market forces.", "53 There should be no sacrifice in the quality and capabilities of telecom services available to isolated Yukoners and in fact there should be special consideration given where it is reasonable and practical to do so.", "54 Access to telecommunications alone is not sufficient to meet the needs of Yukon customers if the price that must be paid is out of proportion to the means of those who require the service.", "55 And lastly, where necessary to achieve the policy objectives and where market forces are not able to achieve the benefits of those policies for all Yukoners, then subsidies are an appropriate solution.", "56 Yukon\u2019s position is that the solutions in this proceeding should enable all Canadians, in both urban and rural areas, in all regions of Canada, to have access to fast, affordable and reliable broadband service.", "57 The record shows clearly the overwhelming importance of broadband access to all Canadians-at home, at work and everywhere in between. ", "58 The EKOS report contains specific insights on the needs and priorities of rural Canadians. ", "59 Concerns expressed about broadband included the higher costs, including overage charges, which is a particular concern in our region, lost opportunities due to slower speeds or service interruptions and frustration with the inability to keep pace with the access available to urban Canadians. ", "60 It is also important to note, that those living in isolated communities identify an even greater need for internet access, something particularly applicable to many northern communities.", "61 Keeping in mind the goals of fast, affordable and reliable, we would like to focus on three important issues: the broadband standard, the broadband subsidy and the transport subsidy.", "62 I will briefly outline two other topics we see as pivotal: ideas for implementation of the subsidy program and how all of these issues all might be affected by the specific circumstances of the Yukon environment. ", "63 Anything else we would propose to address in our written submission.", "64 Fast: the Broadband standard. One of the core issues in this case is the definition of basic service.", "65 Particularly whether basic should include broadband at a specified rate and if so what that rate should be. ", "66 Consideration of this question is closely linked to the obligation to serve, which has in effect been the chief policy tool that has been employed to use -- to achieve universal connectivity. ", "67 Yukon has taken the position that basic must include broadband and we believe that there is some merit in utilizing a regulatory construct, because it has proved so effective in extending access in high cost areas in -- throughout history. ", "68 As described in our intervention, basic service has been a moving target, reflecting changes in technological capabilities and the expectations of customers over time.", "69 It is our view today that the establishment of a broadband standard for Canadians is actually more important than whether that standard is considered as part of basic services. ", "70 If measures are adopted that provide subsidy support for broadband service and for transport connectivity in high cost areas, while at the same time enabling the prospective operation of market forces, it is possible to alleviate the responsibility on a single provider of an obligation to serve.", "71 We have proposed a broadband standard of 25Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload and hopefully, Mr. Chairman, that will be the last time any of us needs to repeat all those -- all those words and we all know what we are talking about when we -- when we use the numbers -- with an aspirational target of 130 for these reasons.", "72 The present defined standard of 5 and 1 is simply inadequate for the current level of everyday usage and it is certain to leave Canadians lagging behind.", "73 Incremental improvement in the standard will not address the gaps that exist today in -- the broadband access needed by Northerners and will certainly not keep pace with future requirements.", "74 Without a stretch goal to inspire what we might term a quantum change, the basic standard will become the de facto ceiling for rural and remote communities.", "75 But whether the standard is incorporated in a BSO or not, Yukon believes that the case for the Commission to establish the standard is unequivocal.", "76 The need is clear and the data compelling. With the benefit of the record here, the Commission can and should lead the development of broadband capability for all regions.", "77 Turning to the theme of \u201caffordable\u201d and the broadband subsidy. Access to a service is not enough if the service is not affordable.", "78 Yukon has consistently maintained that the principle of affordability must address the provision of comparable service at comparable prices throughout the country. This same principle is incorporated in many Commission decisions.", "79 In our view, \u201ccomparable\u201d prices do not require postage stamp pricing policies, but at the same time rural and remote Canadian\u2019s should not pay more for services of lower quality or capability than those available elsewhere.", "80 The results of the opinion survey are very much consistent with this. All Canadians should pay similar prices for similar services and some northern residents, recognizing the additional importance to them of access to broadband expressed the view that their service might even be slightly more expensive.", "81 Affordability must include consideration of the total amount that a subscriber pays. In usage-based billing the actual cost, the actual user cost can be dramatically different than what the stated tariff rate might be. Many users, some in remote communities, stop using the service when the usage cap is reached. The EKOS report shows a sizable number of Canadians, more rural than urban residents actually limit their internet use for such reasons, which we believe does not and should not meet the standard of affordability, as to do so would result in what is effectively just part-time internet service for those customers.", "82 Yukon's preferred approach to the broadband subsidy involves a CRTC-supervised process where transparent proposals for subsidized services can be considered on a community basis, with stakeholder input, defined progress and performance measures and be open to possible competition.", "83 It is absolutely clear that rural and remote users, and especially those in the North, will not have access to the fast, affordable and reliable broadband service without subsidy support. In this regard, Yukon welcomes the announced federal budget support for rural and remote broadband. In our view, this represents a clear opportunity for the Commission to set standards and devise a mechanism for achieving universal basic broadband.", "84 Reliable and the transport subsidy: ", "85 From the perspective of broadband users, reliability means that the service works and is available when they need it. Factors affecting reliability problems for Northern users can include service quality, capacity and up-time performance.", "86 Unreliable broadband connections have impacts beyond mere inconvenience. A recent fibre outage that impacted services throughout the North adversely affecting businesses in transacting online orders, maintaining service-level agreements with customers, and processing retail transactions, just to name a few.", "87 Adequate investment in the physical and electronic infrastructure which connects communities is an important prerequisite for providing reliable broadband. In TRP 2011-771 the Commission's concerns about the impact of under-investment on service quality and reliability led to the requirement for Northwestel to submit a modernization plan.", "88 Based on the evidence considered in TRP 2013-711, the Commission determined that the lack of investment in transport facilities would remain a barrier to improve service in Northern communities, even after completion of the proposed modernization plan. That decision also found the need to \"establish a mechanism to fund infrastructure investment in transport facilities in Northwestel's operating territory\" leading to the consideration of a transport subsidy in this proceeding.", "89 There are two significant problems to be addressed here. One is the lack of access in many communities to comparable service at comparable prices. The other is the negative impact of the lack of transport capacity on the development of competition in Northwestel's territory.", "90 The subsidy mechanism that we propose would consider transport project proposals on a transparent basis with CRTC oversight and be open to stakeholder input and possible competitive supply.", "91 Including the input of stakeholders such as local governments helps to identify project opportunities and priorities and could enable other funding support. A review of Northwestel's most recent progress report on its modernization plan indicates that third party input and funding support is already being utilized in many cases, so there is reason to believe that this approach is workable.", "92 With respect to the issue of the impact on competition, it will be necessary that prospective competitors have access to these facilities at affordable cost, and indeed that their capacity needs are factored in to the project design. While the incumbent is likely to be the only entity with the capability to design and construct the subsidized transport facilities, this process as we have proposed would also contemplate another party proposing or bidding on a project.", "93 Some brief comments on implementation. A considerable part of the record here addresses the possible subsidy mechanisms and the plans for implementation, certainly more than enough for the Commission and staff to develop workable solutions. Instead of repeating our proposals in detail we would like just highlight some of the factors we believe are important to consider in evaluating that mass of information.", "94 Number one, targeted: A mechanism that includes a focus on communities will allow for customized solutions that are effective for the specific needs of those communities. The existing National Contribution Fund provides a general revenue transfer to offset incumbent costs but it does not enable targeted support for specific infrastructure needs nor has it yet been adapted to allow for alternative service providers.", "95 Consultative: Incorporating a process which engages service providers, governments and user needs will optimize the solutions and provide the opportunity for stakeholders to participate in implementing and supporting the solutions.", "96 Transparent: By ensuring that the projects proposed for subsidy funding are transparent and subject to review, there will be a greater recognition of the responsibility attached to public funding support and will also keep open the prospect of competition.", "97 And, lastly, incentive-based: We suggest that adoption of measures that encourage performance, improved efficiency and customer satisfaction will reinforce the obligation to provide service, and to some extent address the factors that would otherwise have been the outcome of competitive supply", "98 Commenting briefly on the impact of the -- of these issues on the Yukon Environment, in the intervention we identified several barriers to full participation of Yukon homes and businesses in the digital economy:", "99 - First, high-speed services are not universally available;", "100 - Overall, speeds are lower and prices higher than in southern communities;", "101 - High usage charges represent a significant burden to customers;", "102 - The absence of competition restricts choice, limits innovation and does not provide price discipline;", "103 - Concentration of facilities ownership within Northwestel and its affiliates presents a significant structural barrier to competition.", "104 The measures in our proposal establishing a broadband standard and implementing subsidy programs for service and transport infrastructure -- for broadband service and transport infrastructure can address the barriers of access and pricing for rural communities. High usage charges reflect the absence of competitive alternatives in Yukon, and their continued absence means that choice, innovation and price discipline will not be available in our market.", "105 As the Commission is well aware, the industry structure in Yukon presents unique challenges for the development of telecommunications policy objectives. Facilities-based competition has long been a hallmark of CRTC policies across the country, and has in time proved successful in generating a robustly competitive broadband market, where telecom and cable facilities are owned by competing entities.", "106 Unfortunately, this pathway is not available in Yukon where telecom, cable and even wireless facilities are controlled by Northwestel and its parent, Bell Canada.", "107 This barrier to competition was implicitly recognized, we believe, in the Commission's decision to re-regulate retail internet service in Yukon, and it is our view that continuing CRTC oversight will be required of the investment, service levels, and prices in the Yukon broadband market to ensure that the interests of businesses and residents are best served.", "108 To wrap up, the issues in this proceeding are momentous for Northerners, and those Canadians who lag behind in their ability to fully exploit the benefits of the digital economy. The record is copious, demonstrating the high level of interest from all corners of the country as well as the Commission's thoughtful and thorough approach to consultation, for which you should be commended. Yukon submits that all of these efforts can be focused on the following -- can be resolved into a focus on the following:", "109 One, universal broadband access throughout Canada is vital to the full economic participation of Canadians, to their ability to thrive in a global digital society and to further strengthen the fabric of the country, locally, regionally and nationally.", "110 All Canadians should have access to comparable broadband services at comparable prices. Universal broadband access will not be achieved without subsidy support and active participation by governments, and agencies in places where it is clear that market forces will not accomplish the objectives. Where there are economic or structural barriers to the attainment of broadband objectives it will be necessary for government to intervene.", "111 The subsidy mechanism for broadband support should be community-based, targeted to needs identified with community input, and transparent. Where feasible to enable the prospect of future competition, measures should be adopted to ensure that subsidy support does not deter incentives for entry or improved efficiency.", "112 To enable the provision of broadband service in rural and remote communities in the North, a program of subsidy support is necessary to extend transport facilities.", "113 Finally, with respect to the role of the Commission, it is our view that without CRTC leadership it will simply not be possible for all Canadians to have access to the broadband capabilities needed for full participation in either Canadian society or the worldwide digital economy. By defining the standards, establishing mechanisms and overseeing the implementation of initiatives to achieve broadband connectivity, the Commission will provide the means and the guidance to achieve this critical telecom policy objective.", "114 We very much appreciate this opportunity to address you. We wish you well in the deliberations and look forward to your decision. We're happy to answer any questions that you might have.", "115 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for that presentation and for starting us off in this hearing. So I will -- I have a few questions for you and we'll see if my colleagues have some others for you as well. Let's start off.", "116 In your position you are advocating for target speeds greater than 5 and 1, only 25 and 3. Why that speed? Why is that the standard and how did you come to it?", "117 MR. PRATT: One obvious reference point, Mr. Chairman, would be the recent -- the FCC standard that the Commission has established there of 25 and 3. It is -- that's one angle.", "118 Another would be the relative balance between where we were; what we know customers are pushing up against now and where we think it should be. As we mentioned, it's important to have not just the bare basic minimum but to have a standard that we feel will be useful for the foreseeable future and with a combination of those considerations. That would be essentially how we came up with that.", "119 I think in the previous submission we had even suggested, and it would be in this submission that the stretch of 100 is probably where we would all like to be but unrealistic to move there that quickly.", "120 THE CHAIRPERSON: I don't know if you have a copy of Exhibit 1. Maybe the Secretary could give you a copy of that so that you understand where I am going with my questions.", "121 But when talking about speed targets, wouldn\u2019t it have been reasonable, and you know I take it that you were informed in part by what the FCC did, but wouldn\u2019t it have been reasonable to look at the likely number of concurrent users, let's say in a household, the likely services or applications that they would be using and using the sort of information that you see on this chart about how much speed you need to look at files or stream radio or audio and the other applications here, including VoIP? And you look at the number of users likely concurrently in a household, the types of applications, even using your expression of the foreseeable future of how many -- what would be the likely new applications -- look at what those services and applications require in terms of speed and extrapolate from that what a basic speed ought to be.", "122 MR. PRATT: Well, a reasonable, logical approach if we were actually looking at providing broadband service ourselves, and those would be the considerations, I expect that the service providers would look at themselves.", "123 I think the one observation that we would make from a user and policy perspective is that it seems every time an expectation is established for, this would be the right number based on the number of uses that consumers or providers find some new application, and the expectations that we all have today even as well-informed as we can be will not be as accurate as what actually happens several years down the road.", "124 And as we mentioned, I do have a concern about the risk of a standard becoming a ceiling for users in the North that if there is -- in those situations where there is -- a subsidy is required and there's only a single provider, there is no impetus for that single provider to adapt beyond that standard that is established. So that would be another consideration I think that went into our calculation.", "125 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you didn't take it from that perspective?", "126 MR. PRATT: It wasn't scientific, Mr. Chairman; that's correct.", "127 THE CHAIRPERSON: With respect to -- and I take your point about future needs. I remember a few years back when the British government built the ring road around London and created capacity, and it was supposed to last decades and within just a few years traffic jams reoccurred because the availability of it meant people were on it. And I guess that's what you are saying part with respect to, if there is more there will be more and the expectation becomes greater.", "128 So what guidance would you provide to us when we look at what the basic needs are to make a reasonable assumption with respect to future needs in that scenario?", "129 MR. PRATT: Well, we thought 25/3 would be a reasonable target for the ---", "130 THE CHAIRPERSON: So in 25/3, what part would you suggest of that 25 and that 3 is for future growth as opposed to current needs?", "131 MR. PRATT: Surplus to current needs. It will depend on the user. It will depend on the -- the rates of growth will be different in different places.", "132 And, quite frankly, we would like to see faster growth in the North and if this kind of building this kind of access facilitates that, Northerners are better off and, I believe, all Canadians are better off.", "133 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Back in 2015 in a related proceeding, you advocated 15/1. Now, it's 25/3. Could you help me understand that, that slight -- well, I don't ---", "134 MR. PRATT: That was ---", "135 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- want to qualify it, but there has been a change.", "136 MR. PRATT: Yeah, right. There certainly has been a change. That was two years ago or the decision was two years ago. I believe that that's -- unless I have got my decisions confused, that was -- we were looking at 2010 data and 2010 needs in that proceeding. At that point our best feel for what our users would benefit most from was 15/1. Looking at this proceeding and, again, reiterating that we were looking not just to catch-up but to get to a place where we felt there was some level of -- level for growth or provisions for growth, 25/3 was our conclusion.", "137 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would it be fair to say because you just used the expression \"your best feel\", I think that there wasn't a scientific or analysis of that?", "138 MR. PRATT: Absolutely, Mr. Chairman. It was not. It was based on the information reference points that we looked at from sources in Canada and elsewhere and what we felt would be appropriate for our environment given the circumstances today and what we foresee.", "139 THE CHAIRPERSON: I notice that both in your 25/3 proposal and your aspirational 100/30 proposal that the upload speeds have increased. Can you explain to me why you think that's required?", "140 MR. PRATT: The increase in upwards as well as upload and download?", "141 THE CHAIRPERSON: I am focusing on the upload speeds because, you know, historically we have gone at one up. You have done it -- you have proposed one up at one point as well and now here you are proposing in terms of a standard of three up and an aspirational goal of 30 up. So I am trying to figure out what has changed.", "142 MR. PRATT: Right. Okay, so for the download point to the increasing frequency of data/video higher bandwidth usage that is ubiquitous. I was in the Louvre last summer and couldn\u2019t get close to the Mona Lisa for the people taking selfies in front of the picture and, you know, shooting them all over the world to their friends. Those kinds of things seem to be exploding.", "143 So it deals with just the simple amount of data that is being consumed.", "144 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just taking selfies with the Mona Lisa in a foreign capital, in a museum, is part of basic services -- are you?", "145 MR. PRATT: Not part of basic services but when we\u2019re talking about the usage that is becoming common when those aspects, that high consumption of band width has become part of everyday life, not just for those social opportunities but economically, culturally and, in our case, for the delivery of services.", "146 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "147 MR. PRATT: And to -- but if you\u2019d like, on the upload, as more people are generating more content on their own, there is a higher, much higher requirement for the upload than there has been in the past.", "148 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, but you didn\u2019t go through -- you\u2019ve mentioned social applications that obviously are quite common but did you go through the potential -- other uses that require upload speeds to establish both your aspirational and -- the standard you\u2019re proposing in terms of maybe videoconferencing or business applications? You didn\u2019t do that; did you?", "149 MR. PRATT: Not specifically or numerically, no.", "150 THE CHAIRPERSON: In your written submission, you stated that \u201csome technology options are not feasible in some parts of the country\u201d and that parts of the North and I guess remote regions, as you know, are served by satellite technology.", "151 Do you think that satellite delivered services are still likely to be in use in what you call the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d as the technology mechanism to serve people in parts of Yukon or other remote communities in the country?", "152 MR. PRATT: There is just one satellite-served community in Yukon. So our familiarity, direct familiarity with that is less.", "153 But certainly knowing what we do know about the topography and the circumstances in other parts of the country, the Eastern Arctic specifically, it would seem a long ways off to imagine terrestrial connexions between those communities.", "154 So it would be reasonable to expect that satellites will continue to be an important aspect of the transport network.", "155 THE CHAIRPERSON: Knowing what we know about current availability of satellite capacity and likely developments, do you think it\u2019s feasible to be thinking of a 25/3 speed standard, acknowledging that there will be communities that will continue to be satellite served?", "156 MR. PRATT: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear others more expert on that subject than we are, but I believe there are combinations, hybrid combinations that can provide speeds in -- if not exactly there, certainly getting there. And I guess based on the assessment or extrapolation from technology development in the past, I believe there\u2019s reason to anticipate advancements in satellite delivery as well that could be effective there.", "157 THE CHAIRPERSON: It\u2019s hard to do regulatory policy on hopes and expectations. The problem I\u2019m having trying to get your help with is if, indeed, your position is that 25/3 is the right standard, what do we do in areas that because of the nature of the technology, that is in a sense not feasible?", "158 MR. PRATT: Certainly, the Commission is charged with the duty of regulating on a nation-wide basis. The Commission has been very effective in adapting to specific needs in specific regions, the North and the Yukon specifically.", "159 I would suggest that it\u2019s reasonable and practical for the Commission to establish a standard based on an excellent record and based on the expertise that is applied to assessing that record. And then where there are circumstances that more time may be needed to get to a certain standard or an adaptation may be required because of the technology.", "160 None of that means that the standard is wrong nor that the standard is inappropriate, nor that it shouldn\u2019t still be the target.", "161 And what we were suggesting in our submission is that -- that is in our belief an appropriate role for the Commission to lead that development.", "162 THE CHAIRPERSON: I notice in your oral presentation today you used the expression \u201ccomparable broadband services\u201d in a couple of places at least, and I take it that\u2019s in juxtaposition to \u201cidentical\u201d?", "163 MR. PRATT: I think that\u2019s fair, Mr. Chair. We have talked about that in many previous submissions in terms of the regular basic service in the North; that we acknowledge it is -- the postage stamp option is not necessarily the most -- that there\u2019s more balancing that needs to be done.", "164 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And would satellite-delivered communities be an area where we have to think about comparable as opposed to identical?", "165 MR. PRATT: Well, there\u2019s a -- comparable could comprehend a number of things: standards could be one; prices could be another; timing could be another.", "166 Our view, as Yukoners and Northerners, is that, to the fullest possible extent, that everyone should have access to the same services within reason at the same prices, again, within reason.", "167 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "168 Okay, let me now turn to the question of affordability, which you\u2019ve also raised in your submissions.", "169 Now, you\u2019ve supported an affordability subsidy to support access to broadband services by low income households. Others have advocated for a maximum retail price for broadband. Do you have views on that?", "170 MR. PRATT: I do think there is merit in a maximum retail price. I think that\u2019s one of the tools that the Commission might consider deploying. ", "171 What we struggled with in putting together the proposal is the balance or the transition from the -- the transition from the traditional approach to the basic service obligation to something that might comprehend more use of market forces. ", "172 So that instead of the default being a single provider, if the default for basic, if you will, is the option for multiple providers, the mechanisms that we suggested -- and I skipped over them in the oral presentation -- would use the tools of transparency and competitiveness to say, now, if there is a proposal by one or another provider to offer this subsidized service, let\u2019s define what the subsidy is and let\u2019s perhaps say that there is a maximum retail price that the Commission believes is just and reasonable.", "173 Then the option would exist that if there is -- if more than one provider could make that offer, it\u2019s -- the obligation, the service obligation is satisfied. It is satisfied in fact by setting the standard and putting the subsidy mechanisms in effect because one provider or another provider will provide the service.", "174 THE CHAIRMAN: Right and it\u2019s not to dismiss your proposal. We read it, heard it again this morning and I think we understand it. ", "175 I\u2019m actually trying to dig around whether you have view on an alternate approach, which is sort of a package for basic broadband services at a price and we wanted to see your views on it.", "176 For instance, because you said it could have merit, but sometimes these things fall apart on the details. What would it look like if we were go down -- hypothetically down that road? ", "177 And I realize it\u2019s not your proposed option; it\u2019s an alternate option on the record, in terms of speed, price and probably based on what you said today, monthly data capacity -- or minimum data capacity?", "178 MR. PRATT: I want to be as helpful as I can so I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019d like me to start. ", "179 It\u2019s -- would that be a subsidized -- a subsidy to a single provider? Is that -- is that the model or ---? ", "180 THE CHAIRMAN: That -- before we decide how it gets financed, I guess one has to define what you\u2019re trying to achieve as an outcome and I\u2019ve heard a lot about speed, but I haven\u2019t heard a lot so far this morning on price and data caps. ", "181 And in fact data caps, I mean they all live -- they all speak to each other those three baskets, don\u2019t they?", "182 MR. PRATT: M\u2019hm. ", "183 THE CHAIRMAN: Your speed will have an influence on data caps, which then will have an impact on price, and so speed is an interesting and important matter, but it\u2019s not the sole issue. ", "184 So if we\u2019re looking at the question of affordability I was wondering if the Government of Yukon has a perspective on both price and the monthly data cap capacity?", "185 MR. PRATT: Well I\u2019d have to just go back to the comparability of prices and as we mentioned, looking at the whole -- the total cost onto subscribers. ", "186 If their -- if their usage is curtailed, as many Northerners have had to do because of the impact of the data caps, it\u2019s probably not comparable service even if the -- if the prices are comparable, so that would have to be taken into account as well.", "187 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you have no specifics to help us figure that one out?", "188 MR. PRATT: Oh, in terms of what the data cap should be or ---? ", "189 My ideal world would have a competitive offering and, you know, since that\u2019s off the table, because we\u2019re here talking about exactly that lacuna, we need to then substitute what would be reasonable by looking at the parallels or comparables elsewhere. ", "190 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "191 And I appreciate you may not have got answers for us today, but you know when I ask questions at the beginning it sort of gives a signal to others to maybe get prepared for questions I\u2019ll be asking to others.", "192 So let\u2019s forge on then dealing with some other issues related to this notion of what is an entry level package and a potential subsidy or other mechanism you might want to put in place for affordability concerns. ", "193 I take it you would be of the view -- or tell me, that it would have to be technologically neutral?", "194 MR. PRATT: In principal that\u2019s correct, but once again if we had our preference -- and I suggest that your preference and mine would be the same, we\u2019d let the market decide those things and not need to make prescriptions. ", "195 So to the extent that technology options are not -- need to be addressed from a policy perspective, my recommendation would be that insofar as possible we be technology neutral.", "196 But in the case of satellite versus fibre that simply just isn\u2019t feasible everywhere and that\u2019s where some reasonable accommodation would need to be made keeping in mind the objectives, the service -- the standards, the service objectives, and as we have suggested, keeping open the possibility of competition.", "197 THE CHAIRPERSON: Your views onto who should be -- on whom the obligation should bear to offer that basic -- that basic entry-level package? ", "198 There\u2019s a bit of an issue as to who in fact could arguably be described as the incumbent in this sector.", "199 MR. PRATT: Well and that was -- we were maybe stumbling towards in the explanation of one -- of the concept of -- evolving concept of a basic service obligation. ", "200 I think that if the Commission were to set the standard and we have the funding mechanisms in place, and some analog of the mechanism that we have proposed was in place, that it wouldn\u2019t matter. That it wouldn\u2019t matter on whom the obligation was placed, because the standard is there. ", "201 The need from the policy perspective and vetted by the information and rules that might be imposed, once that -- once that\u2019s defined then there would either be one or another provider who would take advantage of that opportunity.", "202 Then, you know, one needs to examine the possibility what if nobody were to accept that opportunity to provide service.", "203 In which case I think we used the term in one of our submissions \u201cimpose an obligation to connect\u201d, so that -- and that may be the dominant provider or the incumbent or -- it doesn\u2019t -- from my perspective, it doesn\u2019t need to be pre-determined on whom that obligation would fall.", "204 THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, well let me continue on the affordability issue then, but maybe specifically from the perspective of the fact that you -- you are here as a territorial government and there -- there\u2019s other governments that will appear, so the question of affordability of services I take it is something that provincial and territorial governments struggle with?", "205 I take it there are social assistance programs in Yukon?", "206 MR. PRATT: Yes, certainly there is. ", "207 THE CHAIRPERSON: So in establishing the level of support for those social assistance programs, how much does Yukon Government allocate for the cost of communication services?", "208 MR. PRATT: I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Chair, we\u2019d have to speak to somebody and get the information for you.", "209 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, so could you undertake to get back to us?", "210 MR. PRATT: Absolutely we will.", "211 ", "Undertaking", "212 THE CHAIRPERSON: As you notice the date for that is May 5th? ", "213 MR. PRATT: Yes, sir. ", "214 THE CHAIRPERSON: In that -- and you may have to follow up with your colleagues and the Government on this. ", "215 How does this compare the calculation of other basic expenses such as shelter, food, clothing, heating, commuting, in deciding what social assistance -- the level of social assistance programming required?", "216 MR. PRATT: Right, I expect there is a table that includes all of those things. ", "217 THE CHAIRPERSON: And perhaps you could therefore in the undertaking add the criterias(sic) that you use to calculate those?", "218 MR. PRATT: Yes", "219 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. I appreciate it.", "220 Now we\u2019ve talked a lot about and we\u2019ve heard a lot about the needs of residential users and I was wanting to get your perspective on the needs of small and medium businesses. ", "221 I mean we know that small business represents nation-wide and perhaps as a particularity in Yukon, but let me know if it\u2019s the case, but it\u2019s estimated about 30 percent of GDP is associated with small business and about 9 percent is associated with medium sized businesses. ", "222 So have you considered beyond the needs of residents what are the business needs in Yukon?", "223 MR. PRATT: Certainly, Mr. Chairman, the size and configuration of the Yukon market does not, you know, map the Canadian average. ", "224 And small businesses in particular are often very small, the individual proprietor-type businesses operating a fishing lodge or a hotel somewhere. We have typically viewed those types of small businesses as simply another category with very, very similar needs to residences. So when we have in the past said similar kind of treatment should be applied to small businesses as well as the residences, for the major businesses, national businesses that might operate in Yukon, they\u2019re often better versed at addressing their own needs and negotiating their requirements with either the incumbent provider or an alternate provider.", "225 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, I\u2019ve heard it said, though, that access to broadband in terms of economic development could be a counterweight to a phenomenon we often see of people leaving remote non-urban areas to move to more urban areas so that they can continue to do business. And that obviously is not necessarily very good for regional economic development. ", "226 So I was wondering from your perspective, whether it\u2019s from tourism to other business or sectors that you in Yukon are trying to support from an economic development perspective, if you\u2019ve assessed the business needs from that perspective in terms of speed, data caps, usage, quality of service from, you know, lost packets to jitter, all those sorts of things? ", "227 Certainly the qualitative surveys EKOS did seemed to suggest that there were people in remote areas that were having difficulty because of some of these issues in remaining competitive and developing economically, while still staying in the regions.", "228 MR. PRATT: And that\u2019s absolutely the case in Yukon. The difficulty with reliability that I mentioned in the opening remarks is an object case. With the utter reliance of those businesses on continued connectivity, it really is crucial for them to have the reliable service and access to service that negates the distance and remoteness.", "229 I have to say, though, in response to the first part of your question that we did not specifically identify what business requirements would be as to, you know, jitter and all that. ", "230 But probably overlooked in my response to your question on the 25-3, what the impact on small business would be? And I think the proposal we have made of 25-3 is also keeping in mind the critical impact of that service on those businesses.", "231 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "232 In your July 2015 submission you stated that there were barriers to full Yukon participation in the digital economy and I think you raised that again this morning. I want to have your views, though, to what extent have those barriers been eliminated in whole or in part through, for instance, the rollout of the NorthwestTel\u2019s modernization plan?", "233 MR. PRATT: Not yet would be the quick summary. And I think the key factor we mentioned again this morning is the structural component. The opportunity for competitive entry is significantly affected by the lack of opportunity for facilities-based competition. And that cascades in a number of ways, that without the threat of a cable provider coming in to offer internet service, there\u2019s less incentive to change the usage caps. It\u2019s kind of a fact of economic life that if there isn\u2019t an alternative, there\u2019s no reason to change.", "234 THE CHAIRPERSON: In terms of elimination of barriers, what impact do you assess the announcement of the Dempster Highway fibre build on avoiding some of those barriers?", "235 MR. PRATT: That\u2019s an important link in the creation of some fibre rings that would enhance the reliability. It is, I believe, still a proposal; it\u2019s not shovel-ready or anything like that yet. And it also would address only part of the issue. In terms of the network configuration, I\u2019m sure you recall from some of the previous NorthwestTel proceedings that traffic tends to all funnel back down into Alberta from across the north, which is why an outage there affects Nunavut as well as Yukon.", "236 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Well, has the Government of Yukon given consideration to other specific projects that would be required to continue to remove those barriers you\u2019ve identified?", "237 MR. PRATT: I think the government\u2019s track record and anticipated future track record would be that wherever a project comes up that makes sense, we\u2019d look at it. Resources are not infinite and I think there\u2019s a need to make sure that other requirements are addressed as well. But in terms of planning, it\u2019s not really our role to plan the network. We can have some wishes and hopes, but that\u2019s not part of our mandate.", "238 So unless Steve, you have any other specific things, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything on the horizon we could point to right now.", "239 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Okay, so you\u2019re in a sort of -- I don\u2019t want to -- reaction sounds judgemental, but you wait for proposals to appear and decide whether or not they make sense. When that is done, could you help me -- because then it\u2019s your past practice -- to what extent have you put priority on connectivity versus bandwidth versus redundancy in terms of relative importance?", "240 MR. PRATT: Certainly in terms of the business community in Yukon in particular, the ICT sector, what we\u2019ve been hearing from there is that reliability is one of the most important aspects in terms of the development of the ICT sector in the Yukon. Even if the occurrence of outages isn\u2019t very frequent, the possibility of a business being down for 8, 12 hours at a time inhibits certainly businesses, in particular customers who have -- or businesses who have clients in other territories that they need to service in terms of SLAs and those types of things. ", "241 So certainly right now in terms of projects, we\u2019re looking to develop the Dempster project. And in terms of increasing reliability of the telecommunications system in Yukon is our number one priority.", "242 THE CHAIRPERSON: I take it that if the analysis is being done, reading between the line, on a case-by-case basis, there is no existing program or support currently in place?", "243 MR. PRATT: I think case-by-case would be really accurate.", "244 I wanted to just add, though, I recall in the past Yukon has invested also in enhancing the backbone for mobile access to help deliver government services. So that\u2019s another key aspect for us, being able to provide the same level of service to communities that are remote.", "245 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And I take it there\u2019s no plans for a future government program of support mechanism that case-by-case is likely to be the foreseeable approach as well?", "246 MR. PRATT: I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that either one of us could speak to on that, sir.", "247 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you are here on behalf of the Government of Yukon?", "248 MR. PRATT: That is correct.", "249 THE CHAIRPERSON: In your submissions you talk about this obligation to connect, which is a different lens through which one could look at some issues that we have to grapple with, particularly as it relates to, I guess, backbone facilities and transport facilities. Are you aware of service providers other than NorthwestTel, who could be interested in moving in and serving remote Yukon communities? ", "250 MR. PRATT: I know, Mr. Chairman, that there are other providers, and we could probably hear from several who have capability of doing that. From the government's perspective, we haven't -- there's no specific opportunity that we could identify today. ", "251 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Again, in terms of transport issues, someone suggested that maybe we could have a model whereby one provides support to build broadband transport networks, let's say to a particular point of presence in a given community, and then the access connectivity within that community to market forces. Has that model ever been tried, to your knowledge, in Yukon?", "252 MR. PRATT: Not Yukon. That is, I believe, the SuperNet model, so there is a --- ", "253 THE CHAIRPERSON: Which you would know a little bit about then, from your past experience?", "254 MR. PRATT: From, yeah, way back when, yeah. And I think that can be effective. I think there are -- there still remain challenges, especially if the community is very small in generating enough interest for entry by other providers.", "255 THE CHAIRPERSON: So what are the elements for that model to be successful?", "256 MR. PRATT: Obviously, as you mentioned, the subsidized connectivity at a significant capacity that's going to be attractive to entrance in the small communities. And when we think about the Yukon or northern context, I believe there also needs to be some incentive, policy incentive, by way of a broadband subsidy that would make -- that would create a market opportunity. ", "257 And I just jump on from there that again, the way I would envision that working is that if their economic growth occurs, population increases, more opportunities are seen by competitive providers, then \u00e0 la the forbearance model, it's possible to either, as we suggested in this submission and previously to maybe sunset some of the subsidy provisions or provide some incentives \u00e0 la price caps --- ", "258 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "259 MR. PRATT: --- where you ratchet down the subsidy. ", "260 But there will still be two essential different types of communities, those that where no one could imagine competition ever occurring, in which case the subsidy provision is indefinite; and those that might be transitional, in which case the kinds of things we have proposed here would come into play. ", "261 And that's why we have suggested that if one provider comes up with a proposal that it be transparent, that then everyone can look at it, and if there is another business opportunity, that could be made available.", "262 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thereby creating a marketplace of subsidies?", "263 MR. PRATT: Well, it might start that way, Mr. Chairman, and they -- ideally, the subsidy would not -- and that's, I think, why it's important that it be transparent and why it not be restricted to just a single provider, because then the option is still open for competitive entry to happen in the future, as markets change, as technology changes, and as others view the business opportunities. ", "264 I really think it's important that those provisions be kept in mind. That's the balance that we were trying to strike between the concept of market forces and the obligation of the Commission.", "265 THE CHAIRPERSON: How important would the size of the community and the level of economic activity -- how important would those be to determine whether this would be something that was temporal or perpetual? ", "266 MR. PRATT: Absolutely critical. It could be a small community but maybe there's a big economic engine there. ", "267 And again, I hate to keep -- you know, sound like the broken record going back to what my submission -- our submission was, but the -- that's why it's also important to look at these on a community by community basis, that those opportunities could be unique, especially in the north.", "268 THE CHAIRPERSON: So you don\u2019t, at this point, have anything objective in terms of how much economic activity or the minimal size of the community, in terms of the number of residents that would -- that make the difference, a bit of the Rubicon between something that's temporary and ongoing? ", "269 MR. PRATT: No, unfortunately, no metric that I could offer, other than to say, \"We'll know it when we see it.\" ", "270 We'll know those communities that are clearly -- will continue to need help and the gray area in between is -- I'd be -- be interesting to try and figure out what that might be.", "271 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Let me now turn to directory information. ", "272 In your view, how important is this service to residents and businesses in Yukon?", "273 MR. PRATT: I'm sorry, directory information?", "274 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. ", "275 MR. PRATT: Much less important than it used to be. I don't know have any statistics on what the usage is.", "276 THE CHAIRPERSON: So how do residents and businesses currently access numbers, for instance, for government services right now?", "277 MR. PRATT: I think we'd have to undertake to answer that and perhaps look at the distinction between what the most remote communities and the more wired or more accessible communities.", "278 ", "Undertaking", "279 THE CHAIRPERSON: So are you telling me -- okay, I'm happy to see the undertaking for May 5th, but would it be likely that there's a different perspective, based on your assessment, as to whether in a given community, people would reasonably have access to a level of connectivity that allows them to look up the number versus a community that just doesn\u2019t have the level of connectivity to do so? Is that -- and that there would be a different -- I'm talking about government numbers here, different respective about how those are made available. ", "280 MR. PRATT: I don\u2019t know that for sure, but I suspect that that would be precisely the case. ", "281 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Let me turn now to the issue of digital literacy. It's not really at the core of the CRTC's regulatory responsibilities, but it does -- it is raised by a number of parties in this proceeding, and maybe it's an opportunity to take a snapshot of the issue, especially since one could argue that provincial and territorial governments, who are responsible for education, might have a particular interest in this area.", "282 So has the Government of Yukon assessed the level and extent of digital literacy in the territory?", "283 MR. PRATT: We don\u2019t know. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. ", "284 THE CHAIRPERSON: So could you undertake to verify if that's the case or not?", "285 MR. PRATT: Yes.", "286 THE CHAIRPERSON: And provide details, if there is such a study?", "287 MR. PRATT: Certainly.", "288 ", "Undertaking", "289 THE CHAIRPERSON: Are you aware of any best practices with respect to digital literacy of -- seen from the Government of Yukon's perspective as well?", "290 MR. PRATT: I could tell you something, but we'd be better to --- ", "291 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. ", "292 MR. PRATT: --- undertake.", "293 THE CHAIRPERSON: So you can add that to your undertaking. ", "294 ", " Undertaking", "295 And in the same perspective, are there digital literacy programs offered in schools for kids, I guess, and for adult education or ongoing education, say community centres, that might provide places to build on people's digital literacy? ", "296 MR. PRATT: We will add that to the undertaking. ", "297 ", " Undertaking", "298 MR. SOROCHAN: One program that Yukon Education has in place is that all high school students in the communities are given laptops, and that's a basic part of their -- they take online classes and they're -- regardless of what kind of connectivity they have at home, in the classroom they have access to technology and to internet access, so that's an --- ", "299 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, and I take it -- maybe you could confirm that in your answer to your undertaking, that it's not (inaudible) laptop, but they are given educational training, support, to actually develop their knowledge on how to interact with it?", "300 MR. SOROCHAN: Absolutely, yeah. The laptop is the tool but we can expand on that. ", "301 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Let me turn to monitoring, because it's one thing to make a policy, but it's also a good policy practice to make sure that you can do -- monitor it on an ongoing basis after a decision is made. ", "302 In fact, you\u2019ve advocated, I believe, for more monitoring of internet -- a quality of broadband internet services. ", "303 So in your view, what precise data should the CRTC collect?", "304 MR. PRATT: There is a number of different options, some of which the Commission has already engaged in, the national survey approach. I think that on a -- I guess our view in the proposal was that by setting the standards there would then be a requirement to monitor those standards and if we are looking at a community-based program or a community-based subsidy it should be measured at that community level.", "305 I wanted to suggest a customer satisfaction kind of approach, but thinking back to the EKOS report and the observation that many customers didn't really know what their speed was there may be two cuts at it. One would be the technical and that would presumably have to be obtained from the service provider what is your -- what are the speeds that are delivered? Maybe there could be an independent test done periodically.", "306 And the other would be the customer satisfaction measure of whether they are happy with the service that's being provided, given the uses that they expect to make which is obviously more subjective.", "307 THE CHAIRPERSON: Implicit in my question, and maybe I should have asked you, you are of the view that it is the role for the CRTC as opposed to another body to get involved in this?", "308 MR. PRATT: I would suggest that it is an excellent role for the Commission and whether that required additional resources would certainly be appropriate.", "309 THE CHAIRPERSON: And you mentioned again residential users. That may be an obvious point but is there a role to monitor issues related to wholesale issues and transport issues as well?", "310 MR. PRATT: Presumably, if there are wholesale customers they have a strong interest in making sure that their level of quality and access is available. If there is not then I think there is more of a role for the Commission to look at what is being provided, the prices and perhaps show cause why there aren't more competitors.", "311 THE CHAIRPERSON: You mentioned one of the -- I think we noticed ourselves in doing the surveys, and it's a factor of newer technologies that people don't always appreciate some of the technical aspects of it because it is relatively new. I guess that's not unique. We all understand what a litre of gas is but we would be hard-pressed to actually say how far it would bring us because there is other factors and things change. Oddly enough, a two by four that my father might have used to build is not the same size of a two by four I would use to build. For some strange reason it's not even two by four.", "312 MR. PRATT: The same thing happens with airline seats in my experience.", "313 THE CHAIRPERSON: Indeed. So to what extent can monitoring be effective without a deeper understanding of some of these technical aspects?", "314 MR. PRATT: Okay. The subjective assessment deals with part of that. Is the two by four -- is it still as strong or as effective as it was before? It may not matter if the dimensions are slightly shrunk, looking at the purpose for which it is intended to be used.", "315 And the other, to the extent that there is a safety, security or other technical issue, it would require technical expertise in order to do that monitoring.", "316 THE CHAIRPERSON: In terms of things we ought to monitor, do you have any views about things such as latency, jitter, packet loss or other quality service indicators? Is that something we should monitor or should we be taking a reading based on complaints as opposed to proactively measuring it?", "317 MR. PRATT: It will depend on who we are looking at protecting. The major customers, I would suggest, have the opportunity to examine those issues for themselves and make their own determinations about what is important.", "318 For the individual residential small business, perhaps, user I think the subjective approach would likely -- customer satisfaction be sufficient.", "319 Whether there is somewhere in the middle that users could be disadvantaged if their expectations of service were not met as to the degree of latency or jitter, then I can't right now conceive of who that might be, who would need that kind of protection.", "320 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. My last question before I turn to my colleagues, in your written -- your oral presentation that you talked about right on page 1 about special consideration should be given to reasonable and practical -- where it is reasonable and practical to do so, can you help me understand exactly what you mean by that? Or was that constructive ambiguity?", "321 MR. PRATT: I wish I thought of that. I would have adopted that term. I think what we are driving at there is that with the modesty that I believe is prevalent in our region there is not what's comparable. We want what's the best that we can get, but we don't want to be too strident in asking for it.", "322 But we also would like it to be remembered that those people at the furthest edges, if you will, may have even more needs than average. What we are looking at here is maybe arguing on their behalf that we should give them special consideration.", "323 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "324 Commissioner Menzies.", "325 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thanks. Two or three short questions, hopefully.", "326 How much would it cost ---", "327 MR. PRATT: Which ---", "328 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- for the Yukon to be served in the way that you wish it to be served?", "329 MR. PRATT: I honestly don't know where to start, Commissioner Menzies, you know whether we break it down to --", "330 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Bigger than a breadbox, smaller than a house, you know, I mean a billion dollars, a hundred million dollars; do you have a rough estimate?", "331 MR. PRATT: No.", "332 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. How do you propose it be paid for?", "333 MR. PRATT: I think what we have suggested in our proposal is that the NCF is a workable feasible model when we look at the broadband subsidy, extending -- if we were to extend the definition of basic or reframe the definition of basic that that would be an appropriate model. How the math would work out and whether there would need to be other sources of funds added, I don't know.", "334 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "335 MR. PRATT: I'm sorry. Let me just add, with respect to the transport subsidy I think that an infrastructure funding by the Federal Government would be an appropriate source to deal with the transport subsidy; the difference being that the transport subsidy, I expect, is more like a one-time or you get -- once you get there you have got most of it whereas the broadband subsidy may, subject to whatever competitive options come up later be more ongoing -- the operational. ", "336 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: In speaking of funding, the Yukon government introduced its budget the other day and in reporting on that it indicated there was $30 million in federal infrastructure spending. But I didn\u2019t see -- and you\u2019ve already addressed the manner in which the Yukon Government funds projects on an application-or-as-needed basis. ", "337 But I want to give you the opportunity to address something that, you know, critics of your proposal could bring up and it\u2019s better for you to be able to address it now than later.", "338 The Government indicates that it\u2019s now the -- with Alberta\u2019s demise likely to become the only jurisdiction in Canada that has no net debt, there was $47 million rolled over from the previous fiscal year into this year\u2019s budget, which indicates a very modest surplus but a balanced budget anyway.", "339 So a reasonable person might ask why should people in parts of the country that do have net debt and may be challenged, which is everybody except you, who may be facing their own challenges, why is it fair for people without any net debt and some cash surplus to ask to be subsidized by those who do have net debt?", "340 MR. PRATT: I think the starting point is the national telecommunications policy. This is a national issue. It benefits -- while it might benefit Northerners, it benefits similarly all Canadians in the same way that basic service does. Those considerations were not part of the calculus for the high-cost serving area subsidy. This, in our view, is the same kind of situation only perhaps more important because of the importance of broadband.", "341 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Those are my questions.", "342 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. I believe, just checking signals, that those are our questions. Thank you very much.", "343 We will take a 15-minute break until 10:45.", "344 Donc, nous sommes en pause jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10h45. Merci. ", "--- Upon recessing at 10:31 a.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 10:45 a.m.", "345 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: \u00c0 l\u2019ordre, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.", "346 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "347 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "348 We will now hear the presentation of Kativik Regional Government. Please introduce yourself and your colleague and you have 10 minutes.", "PRESENTATION", "349 MR. DUMOULIN: Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, on behalf of the people of Nunavik, I would like to thank you for giving us this opportunity to have our voices heard.", "350 My name is Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dumoulin. I\u2019m here to represent the Kativik Regional Government, and I\u2019m here today with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bouchard, who is the Assistant Director of Administration and the head of the Tamaani internet section, which is responsible for providing broadband services directly to residents, businesses and organizations in Nunavik. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois is here to answer any questions you might have that are of an operational nature.", "351 The KRG is a supra-municipal body responsible for delivering public services in Nunavik, which encompasses all of the province of Quebec, north of the 55th parallel.", "352 Nunavik is a vast area, roughly half a million square kilometers, with a population of 12,000 of which 90 percent are Inuit.", "353 KRG exists as a result of the James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement, a treaty between the Inuit of Nunavik and the government of Quebec and the government of Canada, which among other considerations grants the Inuit of Nunavik certain rights for self-determination and equal access to services available to all Canadians. ", "354 Telecommunications in the far North is a vital link to the world. For us, it is the difference between being remote and being isolated. But like all infrastructure in the Arctic, it remains fragile, extremely costly and difficult to operate. ", "355 Broadband internet is essential to Nunavik. Over 15 years ago, our leaders saw the potential of the internet to bridge vast distances but due to the small market potential of the region and the high costs, it soon became apparent that if we wanted internet, we would have to build a network ourselves and find some way to fund it.", "356 And so Nunavik has benefitted greatly throughout the last 12 years from targeted initiatives that have funded network infrastructure. Programs such as the National Satellite Initiative, Broadband Canada and Connecting Canadians have allowed us to build a network and provide broadband service. ", "357 The service is slow and expensive compared to southern broadband, but nevertheless, it is a lifeline for Nunavik.", "358 Targeted initiatives, however, address only capital costs, the majority of which go into satellite capacity for transport network, with the remainder for evergreening the last mile network. These initiatives are vital, but they do not address operating costs. ", "359 And moreover, because of the lack of a long-term national policy on Broadband development, these initiatives have become short-term and unpredictable. Case in point, for two years between 2012 and 2014, we had no indication that there would be any additional targeted initiatives, leading us to fear that we would actually have to shut down our broadband service. ", "360 And typically, when the initiatives are announced, we are left with a very short amount of time to design, build and implement. This forces us to make compromises to meet short deadlines, which often wind up costing more and reducing quality of the service.", "361 However, we believe that these targeted initiatives will need to continue, at least for Nunavik, until a fibre optic transport network can be built.", "362 The main stakeholders are the KRG itself, the government of Quebec and the government of Canada, who should continue to work towards building a fibre optic transport network that would be a long-term solution that would solve the problem of very high transport network once and for all. ", "363 We support the principle that broadband is an essential service for which recurring funding is available in high cost areas. While the market in Nunavik has thus far supported operating costs for broadband, the high costs and complicated logistics in remote communities force us to sell our services at very high prices. ", "364 And so without a program of recurring financial assistance, the cost to Northern consumers will probably continue to increase. Our Northern consumers already tend to be low income and are already considered under considerable financial strain from numerous areas, none the least of which is the high cost of food. ", "365 And once targeted initiatives cease, should we get to that point, recurring funding will become essential for evergreening the last mile network. ", "366 In defining targets for essential broadband service, it will be important to consider cost and data cap, not just speed. And I am going to go off script here to mention that we deliberately did not put targets, numerical targets for speeds for data cap for cost, because in Nunavik things typically tend to work the other way around. The budget comes out and then we figure out what the data caps and the speeds will be, based on the amount of money we have available to make that work.", "367 For Nunavik at this point, it would make no sense, however, to impose an obligation to serve broadband on the ILEC, because the ILEC has no broadband infrastructure.", "368 And this brings me to discuss wireline telephone service. Wireline telephone service is also essential in Nunavik. ", "369 The EKOS report, the less talked broadband report, notes that wireline service continues to be used very heavily in the Territories, and it does as well in Nunavik. And this is because our communities are difficult to access, and we must rely on air travel rather than roads. ", "370 So an outage that could be repaired with a truck roll lasting several hours in a rural community, for us, this can easily become a complicated exercise in logistics lasting several days. ", "371 And so having two distinct options for communications, broadband or telephone, greatly increases the security of our communities. ", "372 However, the wireline telephone infrastructure owned and operated by the ILEC appears to be aging and in need of modernisation. There have been at least two recent events, in 2012 and in 2014, where some communities could not rely on the wireline telephone for long periods of time, and these were severe enough to garner media attention.", "373 In addition, Nunacell, which offered cellular service in several communities up until 2015, has disclosed to us that they had a great deal of difficulty with the interconnection between their service and the wireline service due to the age of the wireline telephone equipment. ", "374 I\u2019d like to make a side note here that that is not why. However, Nunacell is no longer operating.", "375 We are aware of the proceedings with regards to modernization of NorthwestTel\u2019s infrastructure and wonder why such a modernization review has not been done for other remote communities in Canada.", "376 I also want to go off script here and say that the KRG is open to working with Bell on improvements for a wireline service as long as the collaboration of that nature would not lead to a dangerous single point of failure on both the broadband and telephone networks.", "377 And lastly, I\u2019d like to address the issues of accountability and self-determination.", "378 By owning and controlling their own telecommunications infrastructure, the people of Nunavik are able to make decisions that consider their own goals and priorities. As an example, we have established a mechanism with Nunavik organizations whereby we are informed in advance of any planned activities in small communities. This allows us to reconfigure capacity on our network in order to ensure that a large meeting planned in a small community will not have a negative impact on the broadband infrastructure.", "379 Contrast this with the events that occurred in September 2015 in Nunatsiavutm, or our neighbours in Labrador, where the non-Aboriginally owned broadband provider decided unilaterally to reduce broadband speeds to all consumers.", "380 By having ownership and control, we are able to make decisions that are for the public good rather than for commercial interest. And we feel the Commission should put a priority on supporting locally-owned internet service providers, especially in Aboriginal areas.", "381 Obligation to serve should include certain obligation with regards to accountability. Specific recommendations have been proposed in our written response to the Commission\u2019s questions but in general terms the operator should be required to be transparent regarding their network capacity including reporting on call failures related to congestion or technical issues.", "382 The operator should also be required to notify local authorities in advance of any planned service impacting event or provide an escalation procedure for service-impacting incidents.", "383 So to conclude, we believe that broadband is an essential service. However, wireline telephone also continues to be essential. Modernization and accountability aside, basic service obligation for a wireline telephone has served Nunavik relatively well.", "384 However, we believe that broadband and wireline telephone service should be considered as distinct services and not rolled into a single service obligation. In Nunavik, the ILEC is best positioned to continue providing wireline telephone service and the KRG is best positioned to continue offering broadband services. And this really is just a question of who owns the infrastructure.", "385 Recurring funding will be needed to provide broadband services at a reasonable cost, especially for low-income households. And lastly, we believe that targeted initiatives will continue to be necessary to remove the cost of network transport from the equation until such time as low-cost transport bandwidth through a fibre optic backbone can be obtained.", "386 Thank you. We\u2019ll be happy to answer questions you might have.", "387 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you both for being here. Commissioner Molnar will start us off.", "388 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Good morning.", "389 I want to begin just by getting a good sense of the services that are currently available in your territory. You mentioned that you\u2019re in a position where you take what funding is available and back-configure to develop your service plans and pricing. So where are you today? What is the basic service, and I\u2019m speaking internet service now, that are available to your citizens?", "390 MR. DUMOULIN: So currently we are operating a satellite-based transport network. We provide broadband services that are 1.5 megabits download and 384 kilobits upload. This is under the Broadband Canada program. We are in the middle of implementing a new program, an upgrade, under Connecting Canadians. ", "391 And this new program that we are currently developing has three principal components. One is a major upgrade of the satellite transport network for five years where we will increase our number of transponders from the current 4 transponders to 12 transponders. This will allow us to reach targets of three megabits to meet the Connecting Canadians targets and potentially as high as four megabits.", "392 The other two components are based on last-mile technology. The current last-mile technology being used is wireless infrastructure that is 12 years old and end of life and it all has to be replaced this year. And so we are putting a HSPA+ solution in all communities in order to do broadband. This plan is not, I would say, fully-baked at this point; we\u2019re still working through some details. And we have recently decided that we will likely have to add LTE in order to meet the residential broadband targets to do this.", "393 In addition, in the communities of over 1,000 population, so that\u2019s four communities -- specifically Kuujjuaq, Inukjuak, (Inaudible), and Salluit -- we are deploying an FTTH network in order to ensure that the wireless networks that are going to be put in there don\u2019t get overloaded.", "394 The technology decisions that we are making on the last-mile network are not only in view of this current transport network that we\u2019re building, but in view of a future development which we would hope would involve undersea fibre that would allow us to greatly exceed our current targets of three and four megabits.", "395 So we are basically trying to future-proof our last mile for as long as we can.", "396 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So that I understand well, let\u2019s talk about the last mile first. Your FTTH and LTE network, those are being put in place with funding available to you from who?", "397 MR. DUMOULIN: The funding was made available through, in part, Industry Canada, Connecting Canadians, in part through Plan Nord and in part through KRG economic development programs. We\u2019re also from -- the operational revenue of the internet service is also contributing a small amount. ", "398 So the breakdown specifically is 15 million from Industry Canada, 11.5 million from Plan Nord, 7.5 million from economic development at KRG, and 4 million from the internet service budget.", "399 COMMISSIONER MULNAR: For your last mile?", "400 MR. DUMOULIN: No, that includes everything.", "401 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That\u2019s everything?", "402 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah.", "403 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Including transport?", "404 MR. DUMOULIN: I don\u2019t have the breakdown specifically of how much funding is for last mile and so forth. It\u2019s rolled into one program.", "405 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Fair enough. So you are upgrading to three megabit? Those are the plans you provide, the service you provide to your end customers?", "406 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah, those are future plans that are expected to go online in October of this year.", "407 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So what kind of data caps would be associated with those plans?", "408 MR. DUMOULIN: The basic plan of three megabits will have a 45 gigabyte data cap. And then we have a variety of plans that are lower cost, lower speed and higher cost, higher speed. So these plans are available. If you want I could make those available to you.", "409 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm. You have already developed and communicated your future price plans?", "410 MR. DUMOULIN: They have not been communicated publicly. They have been communicated internally and with Industry Canada and Plan Nord.", "411 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. And you\u2019d be prepared to file those with us?", "412 MR. DUMOULIN: Yes.", "413 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But not communicate? I don\u2019t want you to be in a situation here where I\u2019m asking you to communicate to your customers via a CRTC proceeding.", "414 MR. DUMOULIN: Thank you.", "415 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But I am interested in how you establish pricing. So you\u2019ve established price plans that will provide three megs down? What\u2019s your upload?", "416 MR. DUMOULIN: The upload is going to be 512k.", "417 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And you established the price of that how?", "418 MR. DUMOULIN: The price basically is -- because we receive subsidies for the transport network, the price is predicated entirely on the operating cost. So a large part of the capital costs are subsidized and then we look at the number of customers that we have and we have to essentially break even. So we operate our service at a non-profit and we have to try to break even and keep a small amount of money to put into a cash reserve for this sort of project. Often the target-initiative programs have matching funds requirements. So we need to put money aside for that.", "419 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And is this the operating costs of the last mile?", "420 MR. DUMOULIN: This is the operating cost of everything of the network. So we\u2019re talking about, you know, once the transport network is operational, it still needs to be managed or maintained, the satellite earth stations, the teleport the internet gateway. So that\u2019s one thing, and then the actual work of maintaining the network in the communities which involves a lot of travel with technicians and so on and so forth.", "421 So all of these costs put together, we try to come up with, based on the number of customers that we have, a break-even business plan.", "422 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: And again, to ensure that I understand, that we understand, at this point with the current funding under the last program that has -- or some promised funding that\u2019s been announced recently by the federal government, you have three megabits guaranteed for five years from a transport perspective?", "423 MR. DUMOULIN: Yes. However, the cost of that to the end-user will be $80 a month. So it\u2019s significantly higher than what you would pay down south.", "424 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: Eighty dollars ($80) you said? ", "425 MR. DUMOULIN: Yes.", "426 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: Is that the price you hadn\u2019t communicated to your customers?", "427 MR. DUMOULIN: Yes.", "428 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: Okay.", "429 MR. DUMOULIN: They know that we\u2019re not -- that\u2019s the current price of our service and we\u2019ve committed to not raising the price.", "430 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: Oh, I see. Okay. So if we\u2019re looking in this proceeding at what are -- I mean, there\u2019s many things being discussed in this proceeding. I\u2019m sure you know that well if we just heard the party before you speaking of aspirational targets of 100 meg. You folks are sitting using three meg -- or one and a half at this point, hopeful for three. ", "431 If we were to focus first on what is the basic needs of consumers instead of an aspirational target, how do you see the service that you maybe not deliver today but at three megs meeting the basic needs of the citizens in your area?", "432 MR. DUMOULIN: Our position is that going to three megs will allow us to survive the next five years so that we can iterate significantly more once we have fibre transport built up north.", "433 So if the question directly is, is it adequate to meet the needs? No, not likely. I mean we know even just from -- you know, from looking at Exhibit 1 that three megs is going to be barely suitable for most applications. ", "434 And we have to keep in mind that in Nunavik we\u2019re in a situation of overcrowding so we have many homes where there are -- are designed for four, five, six people where they have 50 percent more people than they\u2019re built to handle. So typically you\u2019ll have one account and you\u2019ll have 8, 10, 12 people working off of it.", "435 So, you know, it will allow very basic connectivity. We don\u2019t expect -- and we have set the expectation with our customer base that, you know, we will alleviate some of the congestion that is currently occurring but it\u2019s not going to be transformative.", "436 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: And I read that in your submission as well and it is, I think, an important point to note that when we define the needs of a household, households don\u2019t have the same characteristics everywhere in Canada. So your households are larger?", "437 MR. DUMOULIN: The current rate of overcrowding in Nunavik is approximately 50 percent, which mean half of people are living in homes where there\u2019s more people -- there are more -- typically, in order not to be considered overcrowded, it\u2019s one room per inhabitant. So 50 percent of people live in conditions where there are more inhabitants than there are rooms in the house.", "438 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "439 MR. DUMOULIN: And of course this leads to all sorts of -- a variety of problems, whether they\u2019re health-related problems, educational problems, so on and so forth. And telecommunications is no exception so you wind up getting overcrowding, if you will, on the access link into the house -- you know, the broadband link.", "440 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: M\u2019hm. I understand that your -- I\u2019m going to call them consumers because you\u2019re here as an ISP so -- that your consumers face a lot of congestion. Would their primary issue be speed, their cap? What would you say are the primary issues that would be affecting their ability to meet their basic internet needs?", "441 MR. DUMOULIN: I mean, as it was mentioned before, a lot of consumers don\u2019t have the technical knowledge to be able to tell you whether it\u2019s speed or not; they just want it to work. And they want it to work for the whole month, not get a warning after two or three weeks saying, \u201cHey, you\u2019re at 90 percent and it\u2019s going to start slowing down unless you -- you know, unless add more capacity.\u201d And unfortunately, you know, we have to do that because there\u2019s a limit to how much capacity we do have.", "442 So when -- I think if -- our preference is if we can get a three megabits to work uncongested, it\u2019s probably more interesting for consumers to have a higher cap than it is to have more speed, to be able to use it, to use it well, and to use it for the whole month rather than have it for half the month and then run into capacity issues.", "443 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "444 MR. DUMOULIN: That\u2019s our feeling just from anecdotal evidence that we\u2019ve gathered. ", "445 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: M\u2019hm. So that would be your kind of design approach going forward is to increase the capacity so that there\u2019s a greater amount of usage available to your customers at a lower speed versus raise the speed and keep the cap where it is?", "446 MR. DUMOULIN: Yes. Specifically, in the context of the Canadian program, there was a limited budget for the Northern component. And, you know, based on the analysis that we did, we felt that if we tried to do five megabits with that budget that it would not work well and it would probably -- the oversubscription would be such that there would be some heavy congestion on the network. So we favoured a lower cap with a higher -- sorry, a lower speed ---", "447 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: A lower speed, higher cap, yeah.", "448 MR. DUMOULIN: --- with a higher data cap, which is why we\u2019re -- the data cap that we\u2019re planning to offer is 50 percent higher than what was in the Connecting Canadians target.", "449 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: Okay. Speaking of your sort of long-term solution being fibre, are you in conversations with anybody about achieving that fibre transport today?", "450 MR. DUMOULIN: So there have been discussion between KRG and the Province of Quebec since 2013. We did a significant number of studies -- a pre-feasibility study, a socio-economic analysis -- and this work eventually led to the announcement that was put into the Plan Nord last April. So the Plan Nord announcement states an intention -- however, it\u2019s not funded -- to move towards a fibre-optic network in Northern Quebec.", "451 I\u2019m here to speak for KRG; I\u2019m not going to speak for the Province of Quebec so I can\u2019t make any commitments for them. However, the interaction has been very collaborative and we\u2019re very hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to move forward on this project. ", "452 In this year\u2019s budget the Province of Quebec allocated some money for a final feasibility study to build a fibre network across Nunavut. And the hope of that study is to come up with a final price and really look at detailed -- in detail the geography and the bathymetry of the region to figure out exactly where such a network would go, how it would be built and how much it would cost. So our hope is that the study will be concluded some time in the next 12 months.", "453 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: So at this point is there a sense of the cost of that?", "454 MR. DUMOULIN: The pre-feasibility study that we did in 2013 had estimated a cost of $158 million. If we ramp for inflation on today\u2019s prices, that\u2019s 163, I believe. However, indications that I\u2019m getting from the submarine cable industry is that prices have been steadily decreasing for the last five years, which is why it\u2019s going to be important for us to do that feasibility study to get an updated price.", "455 And we also have another variable, which is the fluctuation of the value of the Canadian dollar so that adds an unknown quantity to whether our $163 million estimate is still good or not.", "456 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "457 MR. DUMOULIN: One of the issues with submarine cable is the variability at fibre landing. So what I\u2019m told is you can make the best estimates you want on a desktop study but when you get there a landing can cost anywhere between $2 and $20 million. So that study is going to be absolutely vital for us to nail down the cost.", "458 CHAIRPERSON MOLNAR: Okay. Again, making sure I\u2019m understanding sort of the situation you folks face, you\u2019ve pretty much -- are in the process, through your plans of LTE and fiber to the home, of future-proofing your distribution networks and you\u2019ve got a process in place. You\u2019re working with the government in trying to secure fiber transport. ", "459 With fiber transport achieved do you feel the needs of your communities will be well met?", "460 MR. DUMOULIN: I think the needs in terms of capacity and speed will be well met. The one remaining variable is the high operating cost. ", "461 So -- and this is something that we don\u2019t have a really good handle on because we haven\u2019t operated a fiber network; to date we\u2019ve operated a satellite network.", "462 But the reality of having to fly people around Nunavik rather than send them out in trucks to do things like install drops, and fix the networks, and repairs, and so on and so forth, means that the operating costs remain very high. ", "463 So our worry -- and it\u2019s not our biggest worry of course, our biggest worry is getting this network built, but our worry is how do we then look at getting this $80 a month price down to something that looks more like what is being paid say in -- maybe in urban centres or maybe in sort of near rural centres.", "464 Where, you know, like the EKOS reports mention, that some Northerners are willing to pay a little bit more, but should they be paying double? ", "465 Is what we\u2019re charging fair? Are we going be a -- are we going to have to increase the rates because we need to do more work to maintain this network or not? ", "466 And so that\u2019s a concern for us going forward is if we -- if we get where -- if we get to where we would like to be, which is with a high speed transport network, we -- we\u2019re concerned that we get our -- put ourselves into a situation where it costs too much to operate and then we\u2019ve sort of, you know, we\u2019ve painted ourselves into a corner.", "467 So I think, you know, do we need immediate action I don\u2019t think so, but certainly it\u2019s a concern going forward with this. ", "468 Not just sort of like be put aside and checked off as problem solved and not looked at.", "469 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So coming here today -- and I certainly understand why you folks are before us today, but what would you see to be the priorities for the Commission as it regards helping you to achieve the requirements of your community?", "470 MR. DUMOULIN: Well I think it\u2019s very hard for us to set a standard if there\u2019s no national standard and we want to be able to tell our people you\u2019re in an equitable situation with what\u2019s going on in the rest of the country.", "471 So I think for this, you know, for the Commission to be able to set goals to set monitoring rules. Targets not only in terms of speed data cap and so forth, but in terms of reliability and in terms of quality of service is important for us, because then that gives us sort of a target to say okay well look that\u2019s going on in the rest of the country so this is our goal.", "472 And we need to meet that to make sure that it\u2019s equitable with what\u2019s going on, as long as that goal obviously meets the needs and I would assume it would.", "473 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay very good. ", "474 And so as it regards setting those standards -- you know again the Government of the Yukon who is here before you set out sort of two different targets as it related to broadband 25.3 and I think 130.", "475 Would you see that -- what would be valuable to you would be a standard as to what people require today as a minimum to be able to fully participate in the digital economy and society or what would you see to be the standard that should be established?", "476 MR. DUMOULIN: Well I mean the standard is going to be a moving target, I think. ", "477 So I think more important than saying what is it people need today is saying -- is to put ourselves into a position where the infrastructure that\u2019s being built today is going to be able to evolve towards those needs. ", "478 So it may be for example appropriate today to say I don\u2019t know I\u2019m going to pull a number here, I\u2019m not saying this is the standard, but say the number is 8 megabits well are the mechanisms in place to make sure that in five years down the road that can be increased to 12 megabits?", "479 Or are you going to be back to the starting point where you now need to start building infrastructure again and again?", "480 Which is sort of the situation that we\u2019re in with the satellite transport network, where every time -- every time the target is increased and -- and thus far the target has been set by industry Canada, we have to sort of, you know, take everything apart and put it back together again, knowing that in five years time we\u2019re going to be back to where we started, which is, you know, it\u2019s wasteful and inefficient and costly. ", "481 So I think the whole question of national policy and where we\u2019re going has to extend beyond what digital 150 did and look at 2017. ", "482 It has to go beyond that and say how do we -- you know, where -- how do we get there from here on say, you know, a 15-20 year horizon. ", "483 And so that -- I think we\u2019re -- you know, we\u2019re hoping that there\u2019s going to be, I guess, clearer direction so that we know what path to follow. ", "484 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, fair enough. I think it makes sense that there be different standards for a build, so that you\u2019re building to meet future requirements. ", "485 Clearly if you\u2019re making any kind of capital investments you want to make sure that they are future proofed, so standards for future investment.", "486 But the other thing you spoke of was having some kind of standards upon which the people in your community and you as an ISP, can assess what is reasonable as it regards service delivery, and price, and quality, and so on, which I would think would be a more current -- it\u2019s kind of the scan of today. What is -- you know, what is required today; is that true?", "487 So we should -- there\u2019s perhaps two standards? What is the build standard and what is -- what is it that consumers should be or could be expecting today? ", "488 MR. DUMOULIN: The -- I want -- I guess I want to draw an analogy maybe a little bit to the wireline telephone thing. ", "489 It\u2019s -- you know if something is put in place and then maybe it\u2019s left on coast, it may be working well today, tomorrow, next year, but then there has to be some sort of mechanism to make sure it continues to work well down the road.", "490 So what is that mechanism today? What are we looking at? So in the case of say telephones it would be like well how many -- how many lines out do you have in a community? What\u2019s the ratio of households per line out? How often do the -- does that system get to the point where you cannot make a call out? Who is monitoring that? What happens when you reach those thresholds? Who is responsible for fixing it?", "491 And the same sorts of things, I think, have to be done for broadband. You know, where\u2019s your -- where\u2019s your backbone? Is it running at 50 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent? What happens when it runs at 90 percent and people start to complain?", "492 Who is -- you know, who is going to keep track of that? Is it up to the ISPs to keep track of that? Is it up to some sort of complaints board to keep up with that?", "493 And I think \u2013- but I think if you\u2019re going to set a target, there has to be a structure behind it with mechanisms where you know that your targets are being respected.", "494 And I don\u2019t know how that would look like, but I think it\u2019s something to keep in mind. That -- and there\u2019s going to be some reporting requirements, because there may even be some technical reporting requirements involved in that, so that you\u2019re not necessarily just, you know, relying on the word of the service provider. You have to look at, you know, other factors. ", "495 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. Good. Let me try this again. ", "496 So we would agree that we want a standard for future bills and that will help you in defending or -- or creating your business plans as to future investments such as this -- well I guess if you get fiber transport and you\u2019ve already future-proofed your distribution you maybe don\u2019t really require us to set a standard for future bills?", "497 MR. DUMOULIN: Well I think it\u2019s -- to be honest I think it\u2019s pretty clear that once you get a fiber transport into a community, assuming that fiber transport is affordably costed all the way down to, you know, a major interconnection centre, then you have effectively future-proofed it.", "498 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Exactly, exactly. So setting some kind aspirational targets is perhaps not what you require?", "499 MR. DUMOULIN: No at this point, yes. ", "500 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: From us. ", "501 MR. DUMOULIN: No.", "502 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But having some performance and operational targets and information and standards upon which you can be assessed by your customers is something you would find useful?", "503 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah, I think it would be use ---", "504 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: As it regards ongoing operations of the network; is that true?", "505 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah, I think it would be useful for us to know where we stand and whether we are meeting our goals or not. I think what really what's critical in terms of what we are trying to achieve is, are we able to deliver the right level of service? Are we able to meet the needs?", "506 Are people able to go home and do what they need to do to participate in the digital economy in terms of needs, not necessarily wants? And are we doing it in a way that's affordable so that our adoption rate is as high as it can be within reason? I'm not advocating giving it away but, certainly the cost should be equitable.", "507 And that cost, I think, is a big concern for us in terms of how do we make that monthly cost something that is within reach of these low-income families in an environment where, you know, you just don't have the market density to generate enough revenue to bring that cost down.", "508 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Are any of the programs that you have participated in to date, have they been to support operational costs?", "509 MR. DUMOULIN: No. To date, we have supported all the operational costs.", "510 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And based on your submission where you suggested that CRTC funding -- that there should be a CRTC funding mechanism put in place, was your thought that that should be focused on the operational cost, the ongoing perhaps last-mile cost; is that what you're talking about essentially?", "511 MR. DUMOULIN: I think there is two ways that go about it. The ultimate -- the end-goal is reducing price to the consumer. For us that can be done in two ways. It can either be through a direct subsidy to the consumer or it can be done through a subsidy to the provider that allows them to lower their operating cost. Either way it would work.", "512 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But that's where you would see perhaps the role from any kind of subsidy mechanism as we do for telephone today, to do this similar thing rather than looking -- I mean as you know, a few years back we suggested that there needed to be a transport subsidy. Now, it appears perhaps your transport might be addressed by this fibre but the ongoing last mile distribution -- and I am using last mile in a broad sense outside of your transport that the operational costs of that have no ongoing funding mechanism. Is that where you would see that the Commission could play a role?", "513 MR. DUMOULIN: Yes, so that ---", "514 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Similar to voice", "515 MR. DUMOULIN: Yes. So if the targeted initiatives continue in the sense -- and if we are going in the direction we think we are going in the Province of Quebec and the Government of Canada will contribute, as will the Kativik Regional Government contribute to building this network, then that's the last -- for us that's the last loose thing, how do we get that cost down so that we can increase the penetration and really give everybody a chance to get onto the internet?", "516 You know, the line that we have often said is that the low income -- the children of low-income families have as much of a right to get an education through broadband as anybody else, right?", "517 If those targeted initiatives do not happen and we wind up in a situation five years down the road where we haven't solved transport then we are back to square one and certainly we would be looking for some sort of solution to renew transport in any way we can, whether that's satellite or fibre. Obviously, we prefer low latency for obvious technical reasons. ", "518 So there is a lot of uncertainty right now in terms of where we are going because there is a lot of good intentions that are not necessarily funded.", "519 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Fair enough.", "520 Talking about that price or affordability, what kind of adoption ratios do you have today?", "521 MR. DUMOULIN: I don't have concrete figures. The estimate that we have is about 70 percent adoption rate through homes, and that's just based on looking at the number of subscribers we have versus the number of households in the region. It could be a little bit higher because some people are not necessarily subscribing to our services. They are with Xplornet. However, the penetration is fairly limited.", "522 So 70 percent, 70 to 70 percent, I would say, is an accurate gauge. Compare that to the Let's Talk Broadband report from EKOS where I think the figure was, what, 98 percent of homes in Canada have internet. So we have got some catching up to do.", "523 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you don't have any sense of that 30 percent how many have subscribed to alternate providers and, I guess, maybe there is really just one alternate provider where you are, Xplornet?", "524 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah. So right now University of Laval is working with KRG to do a consumer spending study and we are hoping that some numbers are going to come out of that consumer spending study that let us get an idea of the number of homes -- the number of homes that are spending on broadband based on their spending habits. But no study has been done to date to survey in Inuvik the adoption rate, outside of us looking at our customer numbers and counting Xplornet.", "525 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So that work that's going forward, I guess until you have that work you wouldn't be able to speak about what might have limit adoption? So whether it's their comfort with technology or their viewed need of internet or whether it's the price or whatever it might be, at this point you have no information on that?", "526 MR. DUMOULIN: No, we don't, unfortunately.", "527 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Do you do any work to educate consumers or potential consumers?", "528 MR. DUMOULIN: So our role specifically with regards to KRG and development of telecom is very focused on infrastructure. The KRG is a -- is not a territorial government so it doesn't have the same structure as, say, the Yukon Government or the Government of Nunavut. Education is not in our mandate. So that's the mandate of the Kativik School Board.", "529 A lot of the digital literacy questions that are addressed would be addressed by the Kativik School Board but I don't necessarily have visibility. The KRG does not necessarily have direct visibility into their activities. We know that they do have some programs but I could not give you precise details of what their activities are.", "530 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you don't work together with them?", "531 MR. DUMOULIN: Not formally.", "532 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: A couple other questions. Is there anything particular -- I don't know the extent to which small and medium business are within your communities. If there is a lot of small and medium business, are there any particular needs as it regards business within your community?", "533 MR. DUMOULIN: That's a difficult question to answer in terms of specific needs. I think the vast number of businesses, small businesses are connected. Some of them may opt for a consumer agreement, a residential account. They won't necessarily, you know, want to pay for a corporate account. We have -- we offer a range of services that go from residential grade to, you know, a somewhat higher level, a corporate level to what we do for the Province of Quebec which is dedicated IP transport that's not even connected to the internet and is very, very costly.", "534 Every organization, I guess, has its own specific needs. Some of the things we hear that are, I guess, maybe in the more kind of larger organizations like the schoolboard and the housing board and so forth, is a frustration with you know, multi hub and latency and not being able to have centralized infrastructure because of the latency involved in it.", "535 In fact, I guess the largest business in Inuvik which would be the mining operations they have told us, \"We don't need more bandwidth because we can't use it. We have to have distributor infrastructure. It has to be at the mine. My technicians have to be at the mine. My servers have to be at the mine. Until you can get me latency that's at a reasonable rate I can't even use the bandwidth. I just need enough to synchronize the data and then everything gets done on site\".", "536 And this has to do with the fact that you cannot have a distributed or active directory infrastructure across a high latency network because it doesn't work. And in spite of the fact that latency can be mitigated for certain applications, once you get into kind of a more corporate level it's very, very difficult to operate on high latency now.", "537 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, and just so I understand as well, when you\u2019re putting in your LTE network, you are going to provide voice and data over that network?", "538 MR. DUMOULIN: The intention is to provide voice over HSPA and residential broadband over LTE. So initially we had a plan to do everything on HSPA+. As we did testing we realized that even in our small communities even at relatively lower speeds, when you start getting monthly data caps of 45 gigabytes per month, you can\u2019t do that on HSPA+. So we\u2019re just adding an overlay to do LTE just for residential broadband and then the HSPA we\u2019ll do voice and what we call mobility. So the internet on your smartphone will go through 3G and internet at home will go through 4G.", "539 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Would you see that in your new environment that you\u2019re planning where you have fibre to the home and the LTE, that you may see a large uptake of VoIP and removal or, I guess, less reliance on the voice network?", "540 MR. DUMOULIN: It\u2019s a possibility and we\u2019ve started doing some work with VoIP internally, specifically for internal use for emergency phones.", "541 VoIP remains tricky with satellite latency, especially when you get into multi-hop scenarios. So I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s really -- I can\u2019t tell you at this point whether we\u2019re going to be able to do a complete replacement of phone with VoIP and whether it will work adequately or not. ", "542 I mean, from what we\u2019ve seen in the tests there\u2019s still issues where you get into sort of these routing problems where you have to, you know, go up, go back down, go up again and then your latency winds up not even in the milliseconds; you\u2019re talking two, three seconds. And you can\u2019t have a phone conversation with that level of latency. And depending on which VoIP provider and so on and so forth.", "543 So the KRG itself does not have an intention at this point of offering a VoIP service.", "544 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay.", "545 Just for the record, because you made the point both in your submission and today again about the importance of the existing voice network, and the fact that perhaps it is not meeting the standards or the needs of the citizens today, and what is it exactly you would propose that we should do?", "546 MR. DUMOULIN: We\u2019d like to see the same level of review that was done with NorthwestTel in terms of the modernization. You know, how long has the equipment been there? Is it end of life? What will it be replaced with? What would that look like? Is there opportunities to perhaps reduce costs and improve services?", "547 Certainly reliability I think is a big, big issue, especially for organizations like the healthcare sector that have been negatively impacted by some of the reliability issues. ", "548 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So I just want to stop you because I\u2019m becoming a little perhaps confused about priorities of your region. You would see as you build an HSPA, LTE wireless voice network, fibre to the home, fibre back home into your community. We should be looking separately at whether or not there needs to be a reinvestment into the traditional voice network?", "549 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah, or how we can get those to work together.", "550 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Or why you wouldn\u2019t take on those obligations if you\u2019ve been receiving funding to build HSPA, LTE, and fibre transport?", "551 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah, at this point the KRG doesn\u2019t have a mandate to offer voice services. So from I guess an organizational point of view I don\u2019t know if we even can do it. Yeah.", "552 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But I mean, on the face of it it would seem a bit confusing to suggest with all the money being placed into your organization to expand broadband, that we would then look and put obligations on another organization requiring additional funding to support voice on a parallel network. Am I missing something?", "553 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah. Well, we\u2019re open to working together with the voice provider. But at this point, like I mentioned in my presentation, it\u2019s very important for us to have the reliability that you get of having the broadband not being integrated with the voice service because when you have an issue you don\u2019t want these communities to be isolated. ", "554 So if you want to compare that to what happened in Nunavut in 2011 when there was a satellite outage that is used both by the voice network and the broadband network, the region went completely dark. And we feel that it\u2019s critical for us not to be put in that position because it\u2019s a public safety issue.", "555 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I understand your position.", "556 Just one more thing I want to ask you about before I leave you to my colleagues. And that\u2019s the whole issue of the pricing. You mentioned that today the price is $80 and you\u2019d like some standards or otherwise to be able to assess that price and to move it down to something else. And I guess I\u2019m interested to know from you, if we were to set a standard, what kind of standard are we looking to set?", "557 As you know well, you know, there are arguments at some point that urban and high-cost areas -- perhaps there should be some equity between, you know, rural and urban or north and south. And then there\u2019s others who speak about means-tested programs to address the needs of low-income. There\u2019s been some suggestions about a basic service to provide an entry-level affordability service across all territories. ", "558 I wonder what you think should be the priority as it regards establishing pricing and assuring affordability?", "559 MR. DUMOULIN: I think for us the priority is definitely targeting low-income households. I mean, at the current price that we sell, I\u2019m pretty comfortable saying that some of the professionals that are in the region can afford that price and the subsistence hunters cannot. So we really want to see the target on those families that can\u2019t afford their service to make it more affordable and more comparable to what they would pay for the same level of service down south. So a basic plan. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have specific numbers.", "560 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you would see that it is not unreasonable to have a higher price in the north if there was some kind of basic plan available to those who had income needs to address it?", "561 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah, as long as that basic plan meets, you know, the needs of what you need to do to participate in the digital economy. So it had to be useable. So if you have a useable-level plan that\u2019s set with a baseline and specifically with assistance for low-income families, then I think that would acceptable.", "562 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. Those are my questions.", "563 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "564 Vice-chair Menzies?", "565 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I just have one question. Just when you mentioned latency I just wanted to get your impressions on how emerging technologies such as those outlined by OneWeb for low-latency satellite with the low-orbit satellite clusters, how that might inform your view or what your thoughts are on those technologies?", "566 MR. DUMOULIN: So interesting because we had a similar discussion very recently.", "567 So we\u2019ve had a very cursory look at OneWeb. We don\u2019t have a lot of information on what they\u2019re proposing yet. And there\u2019s a lot of questions for us in terms of whether it will be able to meet the needs and whether it\u2019s going to be just a consumer-level product or whether we can use that and do what we do now, which is combine the consumer network with the organization\u2019s networks and be able to achieve economy of scales to offer -- can you get enough critical mass to actually run our operations.", "568 So you know, is it going to be affordable? Is it actually going to work? You know, they haven\u2019t launched their system yet. And is it going to meet the capacity needs --- ", "569 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: If it works or not would be an important feature, yes.", "570 MR. DUMOULIN: Yeah. So at this point it\u2019s too critical for us, I think, to pin our hopes on, you know, a future technology that's been announced but that's not necessarily in operations. ", "571 We have this, you know, coming deadline, which is, you know, five years, where we need to have something in place and working and functional, and we know from past experiences that it takes two, three, four years to get funding agreements in place, to get all the structure in place. And so, you know, we're certainly not close to looking at OneWeb, but I would be very apprehensive about saying that it's going to, you know, come in and solve our problems at this point.", "572 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. ", "573 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. I believe legal has a couple of questions?", "574 MS. DE SOMMA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ", "575 We have a couple of questions which I suspect he may need to take away and provide us with an answer. The undertaking deadline is set at the 5th of May. ", "576 So first, in the proceeding to review Telesat Canada's price ceiling for C-band fixed satellite services, the KRG indicated that he had awarded a contract to SES for the provision of C-band at that time. However, the details of that contract were not made available at that time.", "577 Could you please provide details of that contract for the Commission, including the following information by transponder or transponder equivalent: first, the capacity purchased in megahertz; second, the price per month; and third, the start date and end date of that contract.", "578 And our second question refers to paragraph 7 of your initial intervention, in which the KRG stated that it relies on contributions obtained by federal and provincial programs in order to make the cost of its service more affordable. ", "579 It indicated that these initiatives are of a finite term and cover only the capital costs of network upgrades. ", "580 Could you please provide for the Commission how much government funding you have received from each of the programs identified in paragraph 7 of your intervention by year? ", "581 And further, for each year in which you received funding for these programs, what were the annual costs and capacity for satellite transport services used in order to provide broadband internet services in your serving territory? Thank you. ", "582 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just for the record, can we hear you say that you actually undertake to do that? ", "583 MR. DUMOULIN: Yes, I'll get back to you on that.", "584 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, thank you very much -- for the 5th of May. Thank you. ", "585 ", "Undertaking", "586 I believe those are our questions, but before I let you go, you did mention the two percent number for number of homes connected.

Just because the CBC says it, it doesn\u2019t make it so. ", "589 Sometimes I wonder if, in the battle of clicks and revenues, truth doesn\u2019t become a victim to all that. I just wonder whether we should have a compulsory statistics course for all Canadians, particularly reporters.

", "620 NISF support would not be limited to incumbent providers. It would enable local and regional community-based service providers to access funding to support the construction and operations of facilities and services in the north. The regions eligible for NISF funding would include the Northern Territories and northern parts of the provinces.", "621 The NISFs would provide a stable, sustainable, long-term source of funding. It is not designated to replace, consolidate, or reduce current federal funding programs; rather, it complements them by supporting an increased role for community-base providers.", "622 In addition to infrastructure, operations, and maintenance, the proposed NSIF would also fund training for Northern residents in technical skills and digital literacies. Priority access to the funds should be given to community-based regional organizations either as stand-alone providers or in partnership with other entities.", "623 We envision the NSIF as an independent entity licensed by the commission and governed by a board of directors including representatives with strong ties to rural, remote, and northern regions. ", "624 As you will hear from our next speakers, FMCC members demonstrate the advantages of community-owned regional and local networks. Residents can operate networks and services such as internet, voice-over IP phones and data hosting, or they can lease their networks to service providers. Otherwise, residents have but one choice, to rely on incumbents that charge high prices and have shown little commitment to maintaining or upgrading facilities in isolated communities.

They should not simply hand over their assets including their revenue, their rights of way, or their political support for the privilege of becoming customers.", "626 Our next speakers represent providers, not just consumers, in the digital economy and they should be encouraged and supported in that role. We now turn to our first speaker, Penny Carpenter, director of K.NET Services in Northwestern Ontario.", "627 MS. CARPENTER: Good morning. My name is Penny Carpenter and, as Rob has mentioned, I am the Manager of K.NET Services located in Sioux Lookout, Ontario.", "628 K.NET is a First Nations owned and operated broadband network. It\u2019s owned by the Keewaytinook Okimakanak Tribal Council and we provide broadband connections to First Nation communities in Northern Ontario and then there\u2019s a few connected in more Southern and Northeastern Ontario.", "629 We support the development, maintenance and operations of services including satellite (inaudible), data and voice, and we also provide our own cellular service to 20 communities. We are part of a joint venture that provides satellite service with other Indigenous organizations in Northern Manitoba and Northern Quebec.", "630 It\u2019s just important to note that 80 percent of the K.NET staff is First Nation. In the last 20 years we have really focused on building the First Nation community to deliver its own services including our staff located in Sioux Lookout. Our staff work in the network; they\u2019re technicians; they\u2019re network technicians, service technicians, sales people, and they work in digital media.", "631 We built the K.Net Network without partners because telecommunications companies would not or could not do it for us in a way that is sustainable, affordable, and meets our communities\u2019 development requirements. Our services are being deployed to overcome barriers of distance and isolation, to improve community well-being, enhance learning opportunities, and support economic development.", "632 For example, in February, Nishnawbe Aski Nation, what is the local political organization for Treaty 9 and Treaty 5 in Ontario -- the Grand Chief Alvin Fidler declared a state of emergency in health for First Nations in the NAN region. K.NET is able to help that crisis by delivering telemedicine services and other E-health services to the community.", "633 Our services also include a centralized IT helpdesk for First Nation schools and we deliver the SchoolNet Program to all First Nation schools on reserve in Ontario. We also are able to provide technical support for member First Nations; this includes websites and emailing.", "634 Within our tribal council we operate an internet high school which enables Northern residents to complete high school in their communities. We developed a broad range of technical training programs that we offer depending on funding availability. We also operate a videoconferencing network which we are currently using for justice services that link remote communities to the justice system.", "635 My own history, I\u2019ve been with the tribal council for over 25 years and I have worked with K.NET for 20 years in different capacities. I have experience in the telemedicine, internet high school, and the videoconferencing, promoting these services in the communities and with government users.", "636 We support First Nation communities to develop, operate, and sustain telecommunication services on their traditional territories. Though K.NET doesn\u2019t operate the local ISP in each community, we bring the broadband connection to the community and support the local community operate their own ISP through either a cable infrastructure or wireless.", "637 For example, in Sleigh Falls, they were part of the NAN fibre build and they have fibre to Sleigh Falls, the local point of presence. They have purchased a 100 meg fibre and they\u2019re able to provide voiceover IP to their home customers along with internet services. ", "638 But not all these communities have these services. For example, there are five communities that are in the Matawa Tribal Council area that did not receive the broadband project six years ago. It was an $81 million project the government funded.", "639 We require a finding mechanism that will enable our communities to install, manage, and maintain their own telecommunication facilities. That is why we worked with our partners and colleagues at FMCC to develop a new approach to support telecommunications in rural, remote, and northern regions, which is called the Northern Infrastructure and Services Fund.", "640 Now Mark will speak.", "671 DR. HUDSON: Good morning, Mr. Chairman and fellow Commissioners.", "672 My name is Heather Hudson. I\u2019m a Canadian citizen and a professor specializing in communication for rural development and communication policy.", "673 I\u2019m going to try to shorten my short remarks because I realize we\u2019re close to time.", "674 But I would like to make the point that the experience of Canada\u2019s Indigenous technology organizations of which you just heard two examples, I believe is unique. I know of no other country or region in the world where Indigenous people have developed such expertise and taken on such responsibilities for the provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services. So it\u2019s a really interesting and unique situation with lots of opportunities.", "675 I\u2019d like to make several brief points and I\u2019ll shorten them because you\u2019ve heard about some of them already.", "676 The Chairman talked about real and reasonable needs and the importance of broadband for northern development. We\u2019re not making a frivolous argument here about streaming and entertainment and games, although people are interested in doing that obviously. ", "677 You\u2019ve heard about essential services such as telemedicine; telehealth; telemonitoring of patients who come home from hospitals; education so people can complete high school or take additional training or even do their homework, as you\u2019ve heard from others; continuing education and training; and there was a reference to small business. And I would also add local governments. ", "678 And we do have information we can share with you on their needs because we\u2019ve recently completed a study for Industry Canada, which is not formally released, but where we did collect information from small businesses as well as non-profits and local governments. And so I did mention there they do payroll; they do banking; they do logistics and personnel services. A lot of that material is often based in the cloud or relies on back offices somewhere else as well as what they do locally. And communication among the communities in the region is also really important for regional development.", "679 Second, broadband must continue to be a moving target. And I won\u2019t get into the debate you\u2019ve just had about specific speeds; we can discuss that if you like. But we think 5 megs down and 1 up are definitely now and will remain inadequate. And we quote several references to that extent as well as what you\u2019ve heard. The bar should be higher than 5-1, but most importantly it should be a moving target revised regularly and monitored because as you heard I think just in the previous discussion, it\u2019s going to change over time.", "680 Third, broadband must be not only available but also affordable. And research by FMCC and some comparable research that I\u2019ve led in Alaska is frustrating in that it shows even if the infrastructure goes in affordability can remain a barrier to usage.", "681 I think the key points that you\u2019ve heard are incomes are low in the north and some people live on subsistence at least part of the year. The population is very young and that means that there\u2019s a lot of new users or there will be; but also that there are a lot of dependents to support and that households are large. And there\u2019s a lot of important concerns about even institutions and small businesses that can\u2019t afford to do some of the services to the extent they would like. ", "682 Fourth, funding programs must include not only infrastructure investment costs or capex, but also operating costs or opex in remote regions. Sustainable funding models are needed; otherwise access to connectivity remains unaffordable and service quality deteriorates as I\u2019ve seen in several projects in many countries including the Canadian North.", "683 And finally, funding programs of all types must not be limited to incumbents but open to all providers, especially Indigenous providers in northern regions, that can demonstrate the technical and organizational expertise required.", "684 In the US, the Federal Communications Commission has required competitive bids with Indigenous preferences in some of the programs in its funding for remote and Native regions and also has included opex support.", "685 I provided additional supporting documentation as part of FMCC\u2019s written evidence and would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.", "686 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.", "687 Vice-Chair Menzies, please?", "688 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "689 Perhaps we could start with you could give me a geography lesson. North of 60 is easy. North of 55 isn\u2019t even too hard. But when you\u2019re dealing with definitions of northern, you said sort of the northern portions provinces and in particular when you\u2019re talking about your proposed NISF fund, how are you defining northern communities? Because in this part of Canada, I mean, you can go an hour north of here and you\u2019re fairly remote and that\u2019s nowhere near 60 or I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even near 47 let alone 49. Maybe you can help me out?", "690 DR. McMAHON: Sure. I was just going to refer to -- I don\u2019t have it in front of me but we did generate a map that was in one of our interventions that took a look at a similar ---", "691 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I think I have it.", "692 DR. McMAHON: Oh, okay. So that was a methodology also used by a recent report by the Centre for the North in the Conference Board of Canada that established what was the northern regions I think based on a combination of factors from Stats Canada and other sources.", "693 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Go ahead.", "694 MR. WHITEDUCK: Maybe just to add to that, we would like the fund to be available to remote communities as well. So in Mark\u2019s case, Mark\u2019s community is considered -- the Plan Northern Quebec ---", "695 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s what I was thinking because his doesn\u2019t meet the definition of north.", "696 MR. WHITEDUCK: It\u2019s kind of confusing. Yeah, the Plan Northern Quebec defines the parallel I believe it\u2019s the 49th. I\u2019d have to verify but it\u2019s the 49th parallel. So it doesn\u2019t apply to 60th parallel as a nationwide northern definition. But I could verify that. ", "697 Maybe Jean-Francois could tell us that because he\u2019s familiar with the Plan Nord more than I am. But Mark\u2019s community is below that boundary.", "698 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. So when it came to the establishment of your proposed northern infrastructure fund and services, it wouldn\u2019t just be that map? Some sort of process would have to be involved to be fair. Because I know you talk in there about rural and remote as well and, I mean, I can think of some areas that are fairly far south that have been mentioned to us in the past as struggling. I mean, the south shore of Nova Scotia, south-eastern Manitoba, places like that; they would have access to this fund as well, would they?", "699 DR. HUDSON: Yeah, I think our first cut was communities without some form of year-round road access which includes seasonal roads. And that certainly includes a lot of northern Ontario and much of northern Quebec. But we found in consultation with our members that there are other examples. For example, in northern B.C. there\u2019s a community, it is on a road but it\u2019s 500 miles from the nearest hospital or airport. And there are communities such as Obedjiwan that are on dirt roads that are very, very remote in the sense of providing transport access. So we\u2019ve tried to expand our definition somewhat as well as to include some other demographic information.", "700 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks.", "701 Just talk about your proposal here in terms of the speeds. You talk about 25 down and 3 up in your presentation, and I would like you to explain to us how that\u2019s necessary. And this gets into the -- what would be the ongoing needs versus wants.", "702 Ms. Carpenter mentioned three or four items there; I think, Telehealth, Tele Education and Telejustice, any number of things that -- issues particular -- remote areas that they need good communications access for.", "703 So I think that\u2019s non-contentious. I guess what goes beyond that is like what do you need -- let\u2019s use that as an example for Telejustice, Education, Telehealth, those areas of which you spoke and keeping in mind Exhibit 1, which the Chairman referred to earlier. What sort of speeds are required to meet those basic needs and how does that fit with your ask of 25 and 3?", "704 MS. CARPENTER: Okay, so Rob is going to talk to the speed, but I\u2019ll just talk to the examples.", "705 Under the Tribal Council our KO Education Board has just deployed Google Chrome books like other Ontario provincial school boards have done. And so those Google Chrome books go to the students in all the schools and they do assignments in the school. The information is all in the cloud and they\u2019re able to take them home and continue to do their homework. ", "706 So that is -- the students are wanting to continue their education. So they need that access at home. ", "707 Under Telemedicine, we are starting to work with the Ontario Telemedicine Network to deploy telehomecare, so there\u2019s monitoring at home for aftercare when the patient comes home from the urban hospital of Thunder Bay or Iqaluit.", "708 So you know, there is a need to make sure that there\u2019s bandwidth available in the home.", "709 DR. McMAHON: And I was just going to speak a little bit about just in terms of what we\u2019ve heard from some of the other interventions as well around changeover time for the requirements of applications.", "710 So of course recognizing emerging technologies, you know, cloud computing, the internet of things, of course, this chair would probably be connected five years from now kind of thing. So more and more devices require more and more bandwidth. ", "711 And sort of, as well, just the characteristics of northern households; so we heard from KRG\u2019s presentation, the large number of users per household is significantly higher in the North. We\u2019ve also heard that, I think, Mark was saying, you know, I think he said -- correct me if I\u2019m wrong, Mark, but over half of the households having between eight to 10 people living in them, kind of thing.", "712 So we have -- if we\u2019re looking at these types of applications at a household level, you may get multiple users, for example, using some of these higher bandwidth requirements such as videoconferencing or that sort of thing.", "713 So\u2026", "714 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: There. Let me understand that a little bit. The number of users per household makes sense.", "715 It\u2019s challenged a little bit when you discuss it in terms of affordability though at the same time, because if you have eight or 10 users in the household who can afford eight or 10 iPads or other mobile devices, that sort of undermines the argument about affordability being an issue in terms of subsidy and that sort of thing.", "716 So can you square that off for me?", "717 DR. HUDSON: I don\u2019t know if you -- I mean we sort of jumped from the services to the affordability.", "718 Just coming back to the services and the reference to data caps, I think, you know, people can find it, it appears some -- to buy an inexpensive smartphone or some kind of tablet or is as -- Penny mentioned to now bring one home from school. We\u2019re seeing more of that.", "719 So one-time cost versus monthly costs with then with data caps, I think, and you\u2019ve heard a bit about that. And your own Let\u2019s Talk Broadband had some very good examples of people saying, well, by the middle of the month, we\u2019ve blown through the cap. Now, I have homework assignments. ", "720 KNET works with operating an internet high school in Northern Ontario so students who never finished high school, adults or ones who dropped out or didn\u2019t have the opportunity can finish high school but -- sort of take continuing education courses.", "721 But partway through the month they say, \u201cI can\u2019t go online anymore because we don\u2019t have the money. We\u2019ve blown through the caps.\u201d ", "722 Another option that we found in some of our research was Webinars for professional development, so people working in the community and maybe they\u2019re doing them from home or wherever. But there\u2019s a lot of training opportunities available for people to upgrade their skills or to get certification, which they need to advance in their jobs or qualify for other jobs. And they\u2019re saying, even the small businesses and organizations, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to use enough bandwidth to participate in those and it\u2019s very expensive or perhaps totally impractical to send our people away for face-to-face training somewhere.\u201d", "723 So those are a few examples. You know, the issue of affordability I think is, as you point out, difficult because sometimes people can find a one shot way of paying for something but the monthly charges and the unpredictability of those charges is difficult.", "724 But I don\u2019t know if Mark or others would like to add any examples to that.", "725 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t want to get bogged down in it.", "726 But what should a monthly data cap be? You\u2019re clear on the 25 and 3 in your proposal but I\u2019m not quite so clear on data cap.", "727 MS. CARPENTER: So just -- I guess I can\u2019t really answer that question and maybe we can get back to that. But I just want to just note that the communities that run their own cable plants or their wireless system, they were developed in the early 2000s and they were -- the cable plants weren\u2019t developed to have caps because at the time when the broadband infrastructure was first developed, we were only bringing T1 technology to the community. So the community was sharing a T1 so there wasn\u2019t a lot of bandwidth to cap.", "728 So just only recently after the NAN fibre build, our communities with the cable plants are now able to deliver more bandwidth to the home.", "729 So they\u2019re just struggling to come up to speed with setting caps or maybe changing their infrastructure to utilize the more bandwidth and to change their cable plant to be able to control it and manage it.", "730 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. I\u2019ll take that as your answer on the data cap issue.", "731 So I just want to refer to in paragraph 61 to 64 of your written submission, you speak of the need for digital literacy. You spoke of it again today. And today you mentioned I think at least twice technical training.", "732 You may have heard the previous questions on this, but we need to understand how such an initiative would be justified within the CRTC\u2019s mandate and why it doesn\u2019t properly belong within the mandate of others.", "733 DR. McMAHON: I was just going to say in terms of our definition of digital literacy, we very much see it as both sort of using things like Microsoft Word, programs like this, devices, et cetera, but we also see it as very much connected to the operations and maintenance of these types of, you know, organizations that are presenting here today. So we see network management and sort of that side of things as being a component of digital literacy.", "734 And also connected to that, we also see a component linked into community-based internet performance monitoring. So you know supplementing -- you know, the CRTC already has SamKnows and is already rolling out internet performance monitoring. But just in some regions as well, we thought sort of a community-based model using tools such as that developed by the Canadian internet Registration Authority has like an online platform, for example.", "735 So digital literacy sort of consisting of some of those issues that we think may be of interest to the Commission.", "736 DR. HUDSON: I think considering the monitoring, just looking at the initial report that you have just issued, it struck us that although it's preliminary, I mean, it groups all of Canada into three huge regions so that it sounds as if there is not enough datapoints to disaggregate even at the provincial level, let alone -- and territorial, let alone at sub-districts to really understand what's going on.", "737 We thought community-based participation in that monitoring could be useful. But I think that the larger point is, as the Chairman pointed out, we are talking about development here and development involves informed usage as well as taking responsibility for providing facilities and services wherever possible. And there isn't any mechanism. That's why some of the OPEX funding, to my mind, should actually include some training for funding because we have seen that it's very hit or miss.", "738 Maybe Tim, who is in education, can explain that there isn't that kind of support for training in the region.", "739 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thanks. I guess what I am trying to get around to; is our mandate to ensure provision of basic telecommunications services and whether or not digital literacy and technical training didn't perhaps belong with CanNor or any education ministries or something like that that we weren't blending it? But I think I got an initial answer that will suffice.", "740 DR. HUDSON: Okay. I mean it's a very scattershot -- I think we can make the case that it's well-justified as part of OPEX but also that if there were some universally-available program tied into with some other place, but there isn't ---", "741 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "742 DR. HUDSON: --- that could be useful.", "743 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, good.", "744 In going back to your July 14th intervention, and just to be specific or try to be helpful, to paragraph 78, you discuss voice telephone and internet as basic services, which is understood. But you also -- you also spoke or wrote reasonably enthusiastically about a provision or accessibility to VoIP services.", "745 So I was just unclear when I came out of it, whether you were asking that voice as in VoIP services be available as or defined as a basic telecommunication service or if you wished to retain the current definition plus the addition of internet services as you define them. So is it both or just making sure voice wasn't lost in the transition given that the speeds you are talking about there is no issue about voice, let alone Skype or video.", "746 DR. McMAHON: Sure. Yeah, I thought prior to -- oh, sorry -- prior to our presentation KRG discussed the need for that kind of redundancy between voice and internet. So I think that really highlighted that importance in these remote communities of having sort of a redundant connection which is absolutely key in terms of sort of basic telecommunication service as well as broadband. We saw that happen when both got knocked out in the North in 2011.", "747 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So if the world unfolded as you are asking and internet services were available as they are, would there be any need still for hard copy telephone directories?", "748 DR. HUDSON: We have had some discussion about that. I think that we found that the responses vary. You saw in our submission that the Cree have definitely a phonebook. We heard from Mark in this discussion yesterday that their phonebook would be useful if it included the right sub-region. So the content is the wrong particular content. And we have also heard about the need to update but update regularly.", "749 But I think that what does come out is that not everybody can find all the information that they need online in terms of numbers both of individuals and also of government agencies which is a point that I think Tim was raising in our preparatory discussion and we can certainly amplify that, if you like.", "750 MR. WHITEDUCK: Maybe just to add that I have seen phonebooks across Canada in my travels where the First Nations community is listed as a government in the government section. It makes a lot of sense when I see my band office number in the government section, but it's not the case. It's not a standard.", "751 From my community we still use the phonebook a lot. internet is not available everywhere. I mean high speed internet. So it's still used quite a bit in my community.", "752 For Mark's case it's different because he tells me that his -- the individual listing for his community is in the Mauricie Region telephone book but his community deals with Lac St-Jean. So you can see what's the use of using that book when he needs the numbers for that area?", "753 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "754 DR. HUDSON: Thank you.", "755 We will also hear from the people from Nunavut tomorrow about their sense of the material. I feel perhaps a little of the institutional memory of this group in that it was testimony before this Commission several decades ago from people in Northern Ontario that first got translated versions of telephone books required to be introduced as well as some other translated information services.", "756 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thanks for your answer.", "757 Can you expand a little bit, please, for clarity on how the Northern transport funding mechanism you propose would work? How would it work? How would it function differently from existing relationships with ---", "758 DR. McMAHON: Okay. So in terms of the Northern Infrastructure and Services Fund, I think that one of the key issues is that it's open to non-incumbents.", "759 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I just want to clear something. When you refer -- in your written submission you refer to a Northern transport funding mechanism. You were referring to the NISF?", "760 DR. HUDSON: I think so. I'm not sure what para you are talking to.", "761 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I just want to clarify whether you are talking about two funds, two ---", "762 DR. HUDSON: No.", "763 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- separate mechanisms or a single mechanism because you introduced that ---", "764 DR. HUDSON: A single mechanism.", "765 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- thought before you went -- in the submission before you introduced the NISF thought so it just confused -- so just one?", "766 DR. HUDSON: One fund.", "767 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "768 DR. HUDSON: We can clarify that.", "769 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks. So how would it work?", "770 DR. McMAHON: Okay. So the idea being that it's complementary to existing federal funding programs such as that provided through ISED and others whereby it focuses on -- those are typically focused on one-time capital builds for infrastructure so this would be around ongoing operations, maintenance, upgrades, et cetera.", "771 And then the other sort of distinction is that it would be open to non-incumbents, so open to these community-based organizations.", "772 We discussed this idea of prioritization of the fund, so you know sort of the first two unserved communities, second to underserved communities that require updated infrastructure; third to ongoing operational funds which will be prioritized based on needs to address the BSO requirement and then, fourth, to other qualified projects.", "773 We did talk about the governance of the fund, so it being established through sort of an independent licence body organized by the CRTC whereby the representatives that would be on that body would include representatives from Northern organizations and Northern regions.", "774 We talked about the process used by the Commission to select representatives to this Board should be open, transparent, ensure balanced representation of cultural populations in geographic regions across the North including remote regions of the provinces; be based on nomination including self-nomination; include enough positions to ensure the directors are representative of the diverse communities and entities involved and include representatives from private, public and civil society organizations with ties to rural, remote and Northern regions and/or communities.", "775 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And would southern communities that are underserved be able to access this as well?", "776 MR. WHITEDUCK: Yeah, the purpose of the fund is to support all First Nation communities that are isolated and remote.", "777 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Okay, good.", "778 I am a little unclear on your answer to question E which is in your written submission on paragraphs 126 to 132 when you discuss an obligation to serve.", "779 If the world unfolded as you propose, who would bear -- can you just clarify who would bear the obligation to serve burden and why? ", "780 DR. HUDSON: I think that we\u2019re trying to point out that we understand that funding to support competitive providers or whoever would win the right to provide these, would incur a basic service obligation where we\u2019re trying to fit into the criteria that the Commission has already had in the past and say that, \u201cAll right, this would have to be the responsibility of somebody who was funded, if they were funded, to provide the expanded definition of basic service that could be adopted.\u201d So we\u2019re ---", "781 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So under your proposal there\u2019s essentially a bidding process for a license to serve a community, correct?", "782 DR. HUDSON: Yes. It could a license and it could be open.", "783 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So that obligation goes to that provider?", "784 DR. HUDSON: There are various mechanisms and an obligation would go with it.", "785 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "786 DR. HUDSON: As one example of how it could work.", "787 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "788 MS. CARPENTER: Can I just point out that ---", "789 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Please.", "790 MS. CARPENTER: --- the areas that we have served in the last 20 years are areas that the other telcos across Canada, or at least in Ontario, did not have a business case to serve, you know, so we moved ahead and worked to develop broadband in those areas.", "791 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I think you\u2019ve illustrated there\u2019s not a business case to serve about 80 percent of Canada\u2019s landmass when you get right down to it.", "792 DR. HUDSON: I think K-Net has been very creative in how they\u2019ve managed to provide this service. But they\u2019ve also had the experience of addressing a question previously raised that if you keep the prices down for the users -- they\u2019ve tried very hard to follow that model -- but then that means that it\u2019s very difficult to have enough revenue to provide or expand the service.", "793 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, can you just clarify for us, please, your position on who should contribute to the national contribution fund? You indicated that all TSPs with revenues above 10 million. Would or would that not include ISPs?", "794 DR. HUDSON: That\u2019s an interesting question for debate. But I think we share a general view with some of the other participants that there should be broad contribution to the fund and that should include retail internet. So I guess that\u2019s a way of responding to your answer.", "795 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So that\u2019s ISPs?", "796 DR. HUDSON: M\u2019hm.", "797 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes?", "798 DR. HUDSON: Yes, I think so.", "799 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "800 So what do you estimate the cost would be of including everything you suggest, training digital literacy, capital required to get 25 and 3 to all of the regions, and the size of an annual subsidy to maintain it?", "801 MR. WHITEDUCK: Maybe I could just start by what exists a little bit in Quebec.", "802 Our organization supports schools with software licensing and et cetera. We do training for technicians. We\u2019ve offered accredited training in the past. ", "803 Our experience is that you\u2019re looking for a certain criteria for students who would succeed in technical training and you need people with high school diploma. And this is another bar to set or to work towards for us because we need to build that capacity up to that level before we get to the next level of training. So we\u2019re working towards that.", "804 However, financing for training is piecemeal when we do this type of training. Educational funding don\u2019t offer that. We\u2019re looking at post-secondary. Post=secondary funding is limited. The First Nations have asked the government for new investment in that area.", "805 So that said, the fund would support these type of activities where we could offer this accredited training for technicians who can manage the infrastructure in the communities.", "806 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I understand your point there. But what I\u2019m trying to get to is, assume that I accept your argument that all of those things are good things. Tell me how much it costs.", "807 DR. HUDSON: I think it\u2019s a good question for which we do not at this point have a definitive answer. ", "808 But we did review the Affordable Access Coalition\u2019s proposal for a broadband deployment mechanism, which is slightly different but somewhat comparable. And they came up with 315 million using somewhat different criteria and kind of a way of, I think, looking at what\u2019s a reasonable pod. And we think bottom-up might be a better way to approach it, but 315 is probably a low-end estimate. ", "809 We\u2019d really need to look harder to give you a definitive number, but we are happy to try to do that and to work with -- I think you\u2019ll hear from several other groups that have variations on a similar approach and perhaps we can come up with something more concrete for you.", "810 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, that would be useful. It\u2019s kind of one thing if you can try to empathize with our position for a moment; it\u2019s one thing to look at each presentation on its own and when you go through a whole week and you start trying to figure out how much it all costs it can be a little intimidating, especially when the answer is, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d ", "811 So anything you can come up with in terms of what would be infrastructure and what would be operational in your view, would be useful because it goes to the affordability of the whole system.", "812 So just moving on. You reference how the FCC has designated funds for tribal lands. And I need to understand how you would suggest those be defined. They are defined in treaty areas, but in non-treaty areas they are less well-defined and where you\u2019ve got ongoing land claims. I mean, most of the north I think fits the definition of that, if you wish. But I need to know what sort of definition we\u2019d be working with in terms of where there are treaties and where there aren\u2019t treaties, where there are land claims resolved, where there are unresolved land claims.", "813 MR. WHITEDUCK: Maybe we could come back with a clear definition just for the sake of being accurate on that one. But like, Kitigan Zibi is a non-treaty community. So anything to the east of Ontario is non-treaty if my memory serves me correctly. But we would have to come back with a more precise answer on the territorial ---", "814 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I will defer to your expertise in that area over mine, thanks. May 5th, I believe is the date.", "815 ", "Undertaking", "816 DR. HUDSON: And I would point out, in the U.S. too this is not an easy question because there are tribal regions and then regions that are Indigenous but not tribal. And so we want to try to be inclusive and we realize that one definition doesn\u2019t fit all across the northern regions and across the provinces as well as in the territories. ", "817 So it\u2019s addressable, I think, but in both countries it hasn\u2019t been so easy just to say, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s exactly the geographic criteria that makes sense because of the history of how Indigenous populations have evolved and the legal obligations.", "818 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you for empathizing.", "819 DR. McMAHON: Oh, excuse me. Could I just add one more point to that?", "820 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Quickly.", "821 DR. McMAHON: In some of our later interventions as well we had broadened the definition to include both Indigenous and non-Indigenous providers. But we set out some criteria around a community-based provider, which would include things that -- you know, for example the recipient would be able to demonstrate that ---", "822 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I understood that one.", "823 MR. MCMAHON: Okay.", "824 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It was just that specific reference and those two paragraphs to the FCC and tribal lands that I was trying to get a handle on.", "825 DR. HUDSON: Yeah. Just to point out that yes, the FCC has learned that, for example, they\u2019ve had to consider all of Alaska as tribal, although there are really no treaties in Alaska. So it\u2019s somewhat analogous to the variations you find here.", "826 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "827 In your answer to question 13, I think, G, you\u2019re talking about retail rate regulation. Do you have any estimate or aspiration for what you think those retail rates would be for a basic service?", "828 DR. HUDSON: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come up with a specific number unless our colleagues have. But they can probably tell you what a ceiling -- I think there\u2019s two issues or perhaps three. What should a ceiling be that people are expected to pay? How is that influenced by caps, which people tend to know about and ---", "829 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s the question I\u2019m asking.", "830 DR. HUDSON: Okay. And then third point, which we\u2019re trying to address, is, you know, should there be some kind of subsidy which could be administered in a variety of ways through providers or end-users to reduce what people pay who have trouble meeting it.", "831 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right, so what\u2019s the answer?", "832 DR. HUDSON: So do we have any comments from our ---", "833 MS. CARPENTER: So I can just share what\u2019s happened in some communities today. So we don\u2019t set rates for, like, the First Nation communities.", "834 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: How much would \u2013 what is the rate that you charge? There\u2019s a minimum ---", "835 MS. CARPENTER: So we charge -- we -- well we bill the connection to the communities based on getting our costs back, so some of their circuits -- so for -- I can just use an example. ", "836 So in our community, such as Big Trout Lake, they ordered a 1 gig circuit, so it might cost them $4,500 to buy a 1 gig circuit with 500 meg of internet on it, but that same circuit in a more rural area south of Sioux Lookout might be half the cost.", "837 So the -- but the communities --", "838 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: What I\u2019m looking for is ---", "839 MS. CARPENTER: -- when they set ---", "840 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: What I\u2019m looking for is --", "841 MS. CARPENTER: When they\u2019re setting up ---", "842 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- an answer that --", "843 MS. CARPENTER: So when they\u2019re setting their basic --", "844 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- sort of mentions -- that sort of like a household --", "845 MS. CARPENTER: Yeah, so they\u2019re -- they\u2019re charging between $35 to $50 a month.", "846 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- basic internet connection and I\u2019m looking for something that says dollar in it. ", "847 MS. CARPENTER: Yeah, yeah.", "848 DR. HUDSON: She just said that.", "849 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sorry? I missed it.", "850 MS. CARPENTER: Yeah, $35 to $50.", "851 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thirty-five (35) to $50 range?", "852 MS. CARPENTER: Yeah, that\u2019s right.", "853 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Great, that\u2019s what I was looking for. Thank you. Sure.", "861 What impact do you think -- there\u2019s been a few developments, public policy developments, going on that I wanted to ask you about and how you think those might impact the availability of internet services to the communities you\u2019re speaking of?", "862 The -- recent federal budget had $8.4 billion including 255 million for community infrastructure in accelerating broadband availability in northern and indigenous communities.", "863 Northwestel\u2019s modernisation plan is pushing forward, there\u2019s the Mackenzie Valley Fibre, Dempster Highway plans.", "864 How do you see those -- those are just some that come to mind. How do you see those impacting ---", "865 DR. McMAHON: Sure. So in terms of our members\u2019 experience, it\u2019s been the majority of the federal funding programs such as those you mentioned, is typically a one-time allocation for capital infrastructure, so there\u2019s also a need for ongoing funding for sustainability to maintain and upgrade these networks; okay?", "866 In the past there\u2019s also been little continuity to this type of government funding, so providers don\u2019t know when the next funding will be available and over what time period and also what criteria will apply. ", "867 Funding is also spread across a range of federal departments and programs, which make it very difficult for our members to track the different deadlines, application requirements and funding opportunities. ", "868 We wanted to mention we\u2019ve recently completed a comprehensive review of existing federal funding programs. ", "869 Not necessarily new ones that were recently announced, but other ones across different federal departments from Health Canada, you know to INAC, et cetera, for Aboriginal broadband and I\u2019d invite the Commission to read it when it\u2019s available quite soon at firstmile.ca. ", "870 We wanted to mention that these federal programs did not need to be consolidated or reduced. This is the last thing the communities and regional organisations require.", "871 But we do suggest they may be reformed in order to accommodate the need to combine and coordinate these different program dollars to support ongoing sustainability and management of operations.", "872 So the Northern infrastructure and services fund approach that we\u2019re recommending the commission adopt, would play a complimentary role to these other existing funding initiatives and could set a positive example for how and where future government programs could be allocated or designed. ", "873 We feel that the CRTC is an administrative tribunal with technical expertise and insight into the Canadian communications environment, unavailable elsewhere in government, could view this as an opportunity to play a leadership role in this area.", "874 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. Those are my questions. My colleagues may have some more.", "875 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "876 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. Excuse-me. ", "877 I wanted to provide you folks an opportunity to comment on the positions put forward by those parties who say no funding is required. ", "878 And I want to -- just because I think it\u2019s quite relevant to your community, speak particularly about Xplornet, who have said the basic service today is met, 25-1 is coming soon, there is no need for government intervention.", "879 So tell me the difference between these two positions if you don\u2019t mind. ", "880 MR. WHITEDUCK: Well I\u2019m just going to translate for Mark so he could respond. ", "881 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Please feel free to speak in your language of choice.", "882 M. AWASHISH: C\u2019est s\u00fbr que dans notre communaut\u00e9 on a quand m\u00eame quelques clients Xplornet. C\u2019est s\u00fbr que c\u2019est un besoin de base.

", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "886 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you didn\u2019t understand my question?", "887 --- (NO ANSWER)", "888 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay I\u2019ll repeat my question. ", "889 M. AWASHISH: O.k.", "890 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You folks -- and you\u2019re not alone in coming forward and saying that there needs to be additional subsidies in the system, whether it\u2019s government -- you know additional government funding or CRTC involvement in creating new funds and you\u2019ve asked for one here yourself.", "891 There is other parties in this proceeding who have stated market forces can do this, there is no additional government intervention required. ", "892 One of those parties who states that and I thought might be particularly relevant to the areas where you serve is Xplornet who say they can today deliver 5-1 to all communities, to all residents, not even communities, to residents. ", "893 Because of course there\u2019s many Canadians who live outside of a formal community, but they can deliver it today and in a couple of years they\u2019re going to be at 25-1 and so there is no need for additional funding. ", "894 So tell me why they are wrong and there is a need for funding? From your experience in serving your community. ", "904 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Would you like to add a little more?", "905 DR. McMAHON: I was just going to say I\u2019m not -- in terms of the type of local distribution model deployed by a lot of the First Mile members, including K-Net and KRG, is very different from that kind of, what we call a decentralized household model where you would install an individual satellite dish on each person\u2019s home. ", "906 So this model that K-Net\u2019s employed, and FNEC and others -- and I think KRG also mentioned it -- this idea of building up that last mile infrastructure so that you would have local distribution through fibre helps future-proof it so that -- you know, in the event that more robust and faster transport would become available than -- you know, that initial infrastructure is in place ideally with, as well, the local capacity and, you know, the various applications, data centres, local ISPs, et cetera, that could be developed on the human resources or economic development so that when that transport piece is put in place you already have that type of, you know, organizational infrastructure and human resources in place.", "907 So it\u2019s kind of an economic development argument, I suppose, as a different type of approach.", "908 DR. HUDSON: I think also that the high-throughput satellite approach -- I mean we\u2019ll see; it\u2019s just coming so we\u2019ll see how well it works but in many ways it\u2019s a supplement not the basic solution. There are certainly regions where it\u2019s very -- it should be very useful to use that approach because anything terrestrial with enough bandwidth just isn\u2019t either technically possible or feasible. ", "909 But you still have the latency problem and you don\u2019t have any connectivity within the community or within the region, which seems like a better model and a less expensive model, although we were not able to get some figures from Xplornet about the comparative costs of their model. ", "910 But I think Mark\u2019s point about the monthly pricing and I would say experience to date with Xplornet and reliability, which could change, would mean that one shouldn\u2019t rely only that solution as both the only technology and only business model to serve the North.", "911 MS. CARPENTER: So I\u2019ll just speak to the local community ISPs. So it\u2019s been about since 2000, so 20 years, of local communities developing their own ISP and building their local capacity. So there\u2019s been a lot of different investment, different government investments and developing those connections, training locally.", "912 For us to have maybe Xplornet serve different locations, you know, that means flying in a technician from an urban centre and I know right now in Sioux Lookout and Red Lake, which are sort of the pocket areas where there\u2019s providers, they don\u2019t really have a trained technician in the area so, you know, you might be waiting days or weeks, where if it\u2019s through the local ISP connected through K-Net there\u2019s people on the ground that can service an area that goes down a home or government office.", "913 I do have some larger businesses like the Northern Store or the MTL Buildings who have had experience with Xplornet dishes who have approached the local ISP and K-Net to provide our service to their buildings just because they need the reliability in the service. Thank you.", "914 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. Just a comment and no question but I\u2019m very impressed with the way that the communities have come together to become, you know, the technical -- have provided the ISP service within their communities when the established businesses did not move in.", "915 Separate and apart from what\u2019s going on here and whether now new technologies and business models might occur as well, I mean the fact that you folks moved in to deliver that to your residents is really impressive.", "916 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Vennard?", "917 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: I have a couple of questions, and it\u2019s more a request for clarification and some clarity on -- you reference the community intermediary organizations. This is on point number 15 of your February 1st submission. And I\u2019m wondering, is this community broadband -- is this some sort of an organization that\u2019s in the middle, some sort of entity that\u2019s in the middle? What sort of role do you see that as having?", "918 I notice that you refer to it as a concept at this time. Does it have a role of advocacy or -- can you just expand on that because you sort of -- you referred to it throughout your submission without really -- without it being really clear. Again at page 168 you talk about -- or paragraph 168 you refer to it not having to serve the needs of for-profit organizations and how it could put money back in. Can you just explain what that is?", "919 DR. McMAHON: Sure, yeah. Sorry, it\u2019s a bit of a jargony term.", "920 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "921 DR. McMAHON: The reason why we came up with this and used this term of community intermediary organization is that we wanted to stress, first off, that we\u2019re talking not just about autonomous local organizations but, as well, regional organizations, okay? ", "922 The reason why we call it a community intermediary organization is because typically these organizations would be non-profits established by these local communities in order to represent them in various ways or provide support for them in various ways, right? So we have ---", "923 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: How is that different from, say, a town council department or something of that nature?", "924 DR. McMAHON: Well ---", "925 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Like, what\u2019s the difference between -- what does that bring to the situation compared to what might be there in another form and why wouldn\u2019t that be working in, say, a town council? ", "926 DR. McMAHON: So not so much -- I would say, like, more of a -- so in Alberta, for example, there\u2019s the REDAs, the Regional Economic Development Agencies.", "927 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "928 DR. McMAHON: I think I\u2019m getting that acronym right.", "929 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "930 DR. McMAHON: So it\u2019s similar to that, right? So you would have a regional group that is composed of a membership of these various communities inside of it. So we have two examples here of First Nations sort of regional groups like this. So K-Net is actually established by a council of First Nations and then -- I believe there\u2019s six First Nations members there?", "931 MS. CARPENTER: Yes.", "932 DR. McMAHON: So Penny can speak more about the specifics in a moment but, as well, the First Nations Education Council. So this would be individual First Nations have actually come together in order to aggregate, you know, various sort of economies of scale around purchasing things like bandwidth for redistribution, technical support. ", "933 They operate things like a helpdesk for schools. They would do things like support local communities such as Obedjiwan that want to set up their own local infrastructure. They might support it with something like an application to ISED or other government agencies.", "934 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So this would be just -- essentially, would it be more accurate to describe it as a regional intermediary organization?", "935 DR. McMAHON: Well, the reason why ---", "936 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: But then a community -- I guess maybe the word community ---", "937 DR. McMAHON: Yeah.", "938 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- implies that it would be -- it would have a local function of some kind.", "939 DR. McMAHON: Yeah, I think so but we really wanted to highlight that they are the intermediary groups between the communities and, you know, other external entities to the region such as governments or other industry that they may be purchasing services from. So the reason why we foreground community there is because these groups are sort of -- like, we recognize, like, individual communities, local communities, wouldn\u2019t have the capacity to do a lot of this work without this type of support so therefore ---", "940 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So would that -- would this organization -- would these organizations also perform almost like a consultancy type of role as well, as an advocacy role? Would they do funding applications for the community or the region or whatever? Is that the concept?", "941 MR. WHITEDUCK: Yeah, in our case at the FNEC, we do get -- we do have the mandate from the chiefs of the communities to advance education objectives for the communities by representing them, advocating for them, applying for program support, and all these things. So the range is wide.", "942 And for the service we offer, it all depends on the level of funding the we get currently so ---", "943 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "944 MR. WHITEDUCK: For example, we do offer special education support services, technologies, in-school supports. So it all depends on the level of funding. That\u2019s it.", "945 DR. HUDSON: Just to clarify, I think your point -- we realized it did sound a bit confusing that, yes, local and regional organizations could be implied under that term, that community is not necessarily one individual site. So that is a confusing way of perhaps using that term.", "946 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So the function of this type of this organization would be to do the things that seem to maybe fall through the cracks or to help things move along more quickly, more efficiently; is that ---", "947 MR. WHITEDUCK: Or provide equitable service to everybody.", "948 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "949 MR. WHITEDUCK: Yeah.", "950 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Where would these -- because as I understand your submission, it\u2019s at the level of concept at this point. Where would these people -- oh, because you talked here about the concept of this.", "951 DR. McMAHON: Sorry, that\u2019s just the terminology we use. I think we mean the definition, I suppose, or the term community and community organization. These absolutely exist and have existed for many years. I think that Penny at K-Net is a really strong example of one such organization that has been around since the earlier nineties, I guess?", "952 MS. CARPENTER: Yeah, we started in about 1995 when there was no broadband in the north. And it was under a school program that we had to provide teachers with information. So we would send floppy disks up to the north. So that\u2019s the start of K-Net.", "953 But quickly we knew broadband was needed in our communities. So it was really banding, starting with the tribal council of First Nation Communities. We worked with five of the six to develop broadband. And it quickly expanded to the rest of the remote communities, the 26 communities.", "954 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So is there like an organization in each of the 26 communities or is there -- I\u2019m trying to understand what the structure of this is.", "955 MS. CARPENTER: No. It\u2019s usually working with a First Nation band. Yeah, so it\u2019s usually the local ISP is usually run by the First Nation band office or maybe their active arm at the local level. ", "956 But K-Net, so as (inaudible) at the regional network delivering broadband to the communities, they take that broadband and develop their ISP. ", "957 But over the years we also developed different needed programs such as video conferencing so that communities could use video conferencing in the schools, the band office, health centres. ", "958 And then we got involved in SchoolNet. We delivered connectivity to First Nation schools in Ontario. So we as a regional group deliver broadband to the schools.", "959 And then we also developed Telemedicine as a program under the tribal council so it connected the health centres, 26 health centres, to deliver Telemedicine. ", "960 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "961 MS. CARPENTER: So that\u2019s kind of how, like, the economy (inaudible). Sometimes funding-wise it\u2019s easier for a group to apply for funding to start a program or to get capital dollars.", "962 MR. WHITEDUCK: I think since we\u2019re giving information back to the Commission about territorial information, we could add the regional entities that exist in Canada for First Nations. That would clear it up.", "963 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Thank you. I think that would be helpful.", "964 DR. McMAHON: And I just wanted to say that a lot of these organizations were establish back in, I believe, you know, the earlier 2000s, maybe even the late nineties associated with Industry Canada had that time had the First Nations SchoolNet program. So at that time they were called regional management organizations. That was a national network across Canada of these groups. So almost all provinces have one of these. You have Atlantic Canada\u2019s First Nations Help Desk; you have K-Net in Ontario, FNEC in Alberta, various others, the Technical Services Advisory Group in Alberta.", "965 And so these organizations were initially -- I mean, they were already doing connectivity work but then they were mandated to connect schools, very much an education focus.", "966 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: How does that fit into your scheme for the mechanism for subsidy and funding and so on? How does that fit in? Because clearly if they\u2019ve been around for a while, they are being funded and paid for by someone and that has probably changed over time. And as we\u2019re looking forward into these, you know, potentially new funding mechanisms, there\u2019s new funding programs and so on going up, do you see them maintaining pretty much the same role that they always have or role expanding?", "967 DR. MCMAHON: Absolutely their role has very much expanded. They began with education. Now, as Penny and Tim have mentioned, they\u2019ve expanded into health; they\u2019ve expanded into different public service provision, human resources et cetera in First Nations communities. They\u2019ve also expanded the range of services to video-conferencing networks, you know, data centres, these type of things. So their applications and services have expanded.", "968 But at the same time, on an annual basis there\u2019s very much uncertainty over the availability of continuing funds. So oftentimes we keep hearing that, you know, it\u2019s very hard for strategic planning for the continuing development of these various services. Like, as I mentioned, they\u2019re increasing all the time.", "969 And so having something like a coordinated approach like the NISF that would work with the various other sources of federal funding, could help in terms of coordination that and then also address some of the gaps, as you mentioned.", "970 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: It sounds like these organizations might be very useful in terms of giving us some information on the sorts of applications and uses, which is one of the things that we\u2019re after here, is what are the applications and uses that might require certain capacities, speeds and so on.", "971 DR. HUDSON: I think our approach is to sort of build on existing institutions where they exist and allow them or facilitate them to compete for some sources of funding that previously would have been limited only to incumbents, and that if there are any additional requirements, and we\u2019ve outlined some, that they would be the type of group that we think could apply and could participate in providing those services among others. So that\u2019s the model rather than starting from scratch.", "972 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. It sounds like maybe some of those groups should have done submissions as well.", "973 DR. HUDSON: Well, we\u2019re trying to represent them.", "974 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, okay.", "975 DR. HUDSON: We are representing them.", "976 DR. MCMAHON: Oh, I should say, yeah, the FMCC membership includes these organizations. We have, you know, Time and Penny here from Ontario and Quebec, but also among our membership are TSAG from Alberta, First Nations Help Desk from Atlantic Canada, First Nations Technology Council in B.C. -- did I miss anybody? Oh yeah, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs in Manitoba. ", "977 So I just wanted to say that, you know, we\u2019re appearing here today but we\u2019re also appearing on behalf of several of these other organizations who couldn\u2019t make it today.", "978 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you very much.", "979 THE CHAIRPERSON: All right, just a few final questions before we take our lunch break, which I\u2019m sure everybody is anticipating.", "980 So your proposal for a transport funding mechanism, just to make clear, would it include satellite transport, in your view? Could it? Should it?", "981 DR. HUDSON: I think our approach was to be technology-neutral so that if satellite is the best or only solution, that wouldn\u2019t be excluded. As you\u2019ve heard, many of our members are moving to terrestrial-based local networks and backhaul networks as they are able to do that.", "982 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. If it were satellite would it include capital expenditures and operation expenditures?", "983 DR. MCMAHON: Yeah. I did want to speak to one thing that I think K-Net and as well KRG, Tamaani Internet, they established satellite transport as infrastructure over a long period of time, right? It\u2019s set over that in order to support strategic planning over a long period of time. I think it\u2019s very challenging for these groups if, you know, satellite is a year over year. So I think that idea of satellite is opex versus capex. I just wanted to make that point about it was very successful in terms of ---", "984 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. But in your view it could cover both. And I took your point earlier with respect to ongoing maintenance as well and let the accountants figure out if that\u2019s a capital expenditure or an operating expenditure. But that would cover both?", "985 DR. HUDSON: I think our main point was yes, that many of these other government programs which we\u2019re very glad exist and some new ones, but they are typically one-shot capex infrastructure programs. And that\u2019s certainly better than not having capex programs, but it doesn\u2019t really address the ongoing issues of operation and maintenance and then designing, you know --whether you call them a business model, at least a break-even model, as you\u2019ve heard here. ", "986 Some of these organizations are eating the cost to keep the prices low. Others are saying, \u201cWell, you know --\u201d but that\u2019s not really very sustainable so that we realize that the capex isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s needed for the future.", "987 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "988 So my next question you\u2019ll probably want to answer by an undertaking because you\u2019ll see I\u2019m looking for detailed numbers. And it was very useful for you to identify which of the First Nation community intermediary you\u2019re representing. So that will be helpful. ", "989 But for those that you do represent, would it be possible for you to provide us the amount of contribution or funding that each one of them have received from the federal, provincial, or territorial governments for offsetting satellite transport costs, okay? ", "990 And if you could break it down by program, by the ISPs benefitting from the program, and by year, that would be useful. ", "991 And by the same token, so that\u2019s the supply side -- as to what you actually have spent in those various organizations, what were the annual costs and what satellite capacity was obtained?", "992 And then if you could do the same thing now this time with respect to broadband internet infrastructure. The first question was satellite relating to capital costs this time, and breaking it down in a similar way. Could you do that? ", "993 DR. HUDSON: We could try. I think there's certainly some of our organizations, such as the one sitting in front of you, who have -- who could break out that information.

", "1043 Can you maybe comment on your belief that everything should be fibre wherever possible?", "1044 MR. CARON: For one thing, for fibre, it really hasn\u2019t reached its technological limitation. While the problems with cable, satellite and also DSL is that we\u2019ve already arrived -- we\u2019re already arriving at the limits of what we can do with it technologically. It\u2019s already showing some strain. And even when somebody is offered faster speed Internet, there seems to be a lot of problems with maintaining the stability of the connexion. ", "1045 So I\u2019ve been -- we\u2019re seeing that in this case -- it didn\u2019t seem very practical to keep using old technology that\u2019s actually falling behind on our needs for data.", "1046 Even the Chair mentioned earlier in the day about the ring road around London that it was built to last a few decades but suddenly everybody wanted to buy cars and the next thing you know, it\u2019s full of traffic jams.", "1047 We\u2019re coming up to the same situation right now where the Internet is requiring a lot more speed because more people are getting onto it and more people have a need for it, as I\u2019ve explained in the beginning. To the point where we need to overbuild the network at this stage. We cannot just -- we can no longer just catch up to what we need -- a level that we need and then just hope that it\u2019s enough for what we need.", "1048 Right now, we\u2019re in the situation where gigabit Ethernet will become a necessity. Just a 4K video, for example; that takes 25 megabits per second by itself, and that\u2019s just now. We could actually go higher later on, depending on if we evolve to a 8K video, which is even more demanding.", "1049 And we are at the stage where we really need to overbuild the network instead of just trying to do -- deal with the status quo. Push for limits in which we won\u2019t have to worry about if we have enough bandwidth to deal with -- to do the things we need to do and not have to come back here every five or six years to review the limits.", "1050 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I\u2019m on the Website right now for a large service provider in the country who will remain nameless but they\u2019re offering, over their traditional technologies, 250 Megs down and 20 Megs up. ", "1051 And this is a basic service here and we\u2019re trying to determine what the ---", "1052 MR. CARON: Is this fibre-based?", "1053 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: No, it\u2019s not fibre-based.", "1054 MR. CARON: We have to be careful with that because I\u2019ve seen some of the sites using the word, \u201chybrid fibre\u201d. I know one, I think it\u2019s Vid\u00e9otron that uses hybrid fibre but what it means is essentially -- they do have fibre going to a node. It\u2019s more like fibre to the node but then it still goes from copper up to people\u2019s lodgings. ", "1055 And it is the same case with Bell with their Fibe system. They make it sound like it\u2019s fibre but it\u2019s actually copper. It\u2019s just that they brought the plant or a subsidy of the plant closer to the lodgings.", "1056 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And in this particular case, it wouldn\u2019t be copper-based, but their advertised speeds are 250 Megs down and 20 Megs up. And given that this is a basic hearing and we\u2019re trying to determine what the basic needs are ---", "1057 MR. CARON: Right.", "1058 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- of Canadians, they may take exception to the fact that you\u2019re implying that their current networks are not capable of, at least at the basic level, meeting the needs of Canadians. ", "1059 MR. CARON: Well, if they were really concerned about that, I mean they would have already met the needs of Canadians by now.", "1060 But what I\u2019m hearing more than anything else is that a lot of Canadians are really getting fed up of having inadequate speeds and also high prices along with the usage-based billing, which to me is questionable on the legal sense of the word to the point where they really would like to see better services or at least something a little bit more consistent than what they\u2019re getting right now.", "1061 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: In your video, you talked a lot about the last mile access into the home ---", "1062 MR. CARON: Yes.", "1063 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- or into the premises.", "1064 Are you of the view that the current backbone infrastructure that\u2019s in place is adequate on the go forward and any funding should be targeting the last mile, as opposed to ---", "1065 MR. CARON: I would prefer targeting the last mile because I\u2019ve already had a -- some servers in the data centre, and this was with Cogent, Cogent Communications. And their policy was to give me the speed that I needed without any usage caps, and I could even go over my speed from time to time if I wanted to, without any worries about extra billing as long as it wasn\u2019t more than 10 percent of my monthly usage.", "1066 They seemed to have absolutely -- I even spoke to them and they had absolutely no problems giving me what I needed, even going full-throttle if I needed to, which left me with the impression, along with the information I studied, that the backbone is actually in pretty good shape. In the backbone side there\u2019s already many transports available. The ones I listed was mainly for public access points because the private access points they won\u2019t reveal any information.", "1067 But still, when you add up the potential of what these private access points may have on top of what we already have on the public access points, and at the rate they\u2019re upgrading it -- like I said in the video, within a period of 12 years they had 1 gigabit ports for their clients at the beginning. And then with the 12 years they went to 100 gigabit ports, 100-fold in just 12 years. And they\u2019re handling the loads pretty well. It\u2019s very rare that they ever have any problems with overloads.", "1068 So on the case of the backbone, I really have no worries about it. Just like I don\u2019t have any worries about the service providers who take advantage of the backbone. It really comes down only to the last mile, to the old technology that\u2019s really clogging us up. ", "1069 It\u2019s becoming a serious problem at this stage where these companies really are profit-oriented to the point of excluding all else. I really feel that they\u2019re not doing the job they need to do, especially in remote communities where the information -- even tomorrow you\u2019ll be meeting with Nunavut\u2019s government and I saw their presentation and saw that a satellite link was just 5-1 with a 30-gig cap, $179 a month. ", "1070 And unfortunately 5-1 service to me is the dial-up of the 21st century. We really need to go much higher than that and much higher than just 25 down. And also especially the uplink is also a problem because I always see that the uplinks are always much slower. ", "1071 We need to also concentrate on maybe offering as close to symmetrical speeds as possible. Not only the 25 down -- well, not 25, but I would prefer something like 100 down and 100 up as a minimum. This way we would at least have enough bandwidth to deal with families having some heavy applications.", "1072 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: If you\u2019re advocating for 100 meg down or perhaps even symmetrical service, what do you view are the basic needs of a residential or even a small business customer? You know, how much is enough to meet that basic need? Because you mentioned, you know, high-definition videos a second ago.", "1073 MR. CARON: Right. But I can tell you also from my experience of automating truck skills, which I do in remote sites all across the country where the internet service is not very good, we have to send them updates. And these can be pretty big files. And unfortunately their service is actually -- they\u2019re below 25-1 in some cases. Or even in one of the offices where I work from they also have very slow service. And it becomes a very long process; it can take over half an hour just to send them an update. ", "1074 I\u2019ll give you an example. If you had a 100 megabit network in your office, which is actually pretty standard for Ethernet -- I mean, you can go 1 gigabit in an internal office and 100 megabits a second, it\u2019s a legacy speed. And yet, it\u2019s more than enough to do the job we need to do inside an office. We\u2019re coming to the point where we need that kind of speed outside the office between regional office, between homes and offices, between all different kinds of points of access.", "1075 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, you had suggested that federal government funding should be targeted towards your community.", "1076 MR. CARON: Both federal and provincial.", "1077 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Both federal and provincial?", "1078 MR. CARON: Yes. ", "1079 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So you weren\u2019t anticipating any additional fees from service providers being levied on the end-user. You\u2019re thinking that would come from general tax revenue, potentially tax increases to fund all of this, on the part of provincial and federal governments?", "1080 MR. CARON: Well, on that I know that for the last budget, the federal budget, that they had allocated a substantial amount of money, although it\u2019s spread in a few years, 6 million in this year, 81 million in the next year. That\u2019s one source of revenue they could use for it.", "1081 Another possibility is to use any residuals that are available in infrastructure budgets. Because essentially the internet is becoming an infrastructure element and an essential one just as much as roads have become essential. ", "1082 And with this method, in fact, it actually mimics a bit what we do with the roads already. The government pays for the roads but it\u2019s private industry that actually sells the cars. And with the internet we could actually do the same principle where we can at least build a network that any service provider could use and bill the customers accordingly. ", "1083 The other advantage with this is because these communities will be more service-oriented instead of profit-oriented, the fees they would be charging to either independent or already larger service providers, will maybe be much more reasonable than what these service providers can get from the incumbents as it is now. not only on the level of the fees themselves, but also on the support. ", "1084 I know that TekSavvy is following afterwards. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to be mentioning their issues they\u2019ve had with Rogers recently, but it might be something interesting to ask them about it and to see how their relationships with the incumbents are and what they would think about if they would have to deal with a community instead of a private company. ", "1085 Or another possibility is that a few communities get together, create a consortium which negotiates together with the service providers the same way the Canadian Cable Systems Alliance works with smaller cable operators in creating a single point where all the contracts can be negotiated.", "1086 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So just so I\u2019m clear, are you suggesting that targeted funding would only go to un-served or underserved communities, not communities that are ---", "1087 MR. CARON: No, it will go to existing communities because even in a city you will have spots in the city where the service is underserved and where a need for improvement is needed. I\u2019ve already had people comment on me where they moved into a newly-built suburb and they found out there was an argument between the contractor and the service provider and suddenly they found they have absolutely no service whatsoever.", "1088 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that clarification because I was interested to see on page 7 of your submission when you\u2019re talking about the cost factor to do this that you cited Toronto and the fact that there are just shy of 5,400 kilometres of roads in Toronto. ", "1089 MR. CARON: Yes, if you assume that you\u2019re going to be running -- well, not necessarily running fiber-optics cabling over very single kilometre of road. But you will probably have to run a significant amount if you want to reach every single business.", "1090 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: There could be those living in remote areas of the country or in Canada\u2019s north that would find it hard to believe that additional investment infrastructure is required beyond what the TSPs are doing today in large centres like Toronto. Would you care to speak to that?", "1091 MR. CARON: It\u2019s not as much as -- how can I say this? It\u2019s more like -- I\u2019m just trying to find a way. The reason for this whole proposal of mine was to try to find a balance in which the needs of the people are actually satisfied by a partially government-run operation.", "1092 Yes, and I\u2019m aware that the people in the north will be a little miffed if people in larger cities get better internet much sooner than what they have now, which is actually pre-21st century technology and speeds. Well, that\u2019s why I also had the other option of asking for a research and development program so we can at least find a solution to covering large distances. ", "1093 We have to understand we\u2019re a very large country. It\u2019s 8,000 kilometres wide just driving on the Trans-Canada Highway. And then I can\u2019t remember how far it is north. And we have to live with these conditions; we have to adapt to these conditions. And that\u2019s something I feel that hasn\u2019t really been done yet.", "1094 And I know that the gadget that I portrayed in there is a little ludicrous at first, but it is actually based on old technology. Here it is. We\u2019ve already done this before crossing large distances in what\u2019s called the Trans-Canada microwave. This was completed in 1958. You might even have seen the Heritage Minute about it.", "1095 And just to give you some details, it was 139 towers over 6,275 kilometres of distance. It was 50 million back there, 336 million in 2003 dollars. It had a latency of only 20 milliseconds, which if you have that on your internet service would be pretty good. And this was in the era of vacuum tubes.", "1096 They managed to do something with vacuum tubes that we can\u2019t seem to be able to do today with modern technology. And I\u2019d like to see a research and development program developed for this so that we can bring the north up to date and up to speed with the rest of the country and not have them face a situation where as technology becomes more prevalent in their society that they would actually have to consider moving out of the north. I don\u2019t see that as an option; I\u2019d rather see us do a push to actually find a solution to this.", "1097 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Then if there is going to be a significant amount of government funding that would go into a program like this, isn\u2019t it best to spend the money in those areas versus overbuilding markets that many might suggest are very, very well served?", "1098 MR. CARON: Would could set the priority for the northern communities; we can do that. Because I mean if a city or a community has decent internet, if a service provider already -- a last-mile owner has already set up fibre in the area and is already offering the service that\u2019s needed, we don\u2019t really need to build in those areas. We just need to try and start building in areas where the service is severely lacking and get -- just try to get people up to speed at least with different internet speed so they could get their services -- their daily lives going.", "1099 Already most of the government services that we have are already available only online, not only online but primarily online. Just to give you an example, registering my business at the federal level, incorporating, was $200 -- $200, if I did it online, $250 if you did it on paper. So already there\u2019s a financial penalty imposed on people who already don\u2019t have internet access.", "1100 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: You cited Australia having invested $56 billion in a program to bring facilities to its ---", "1101 MR. CARON: That is the current estimate. They\u2019re still building out but they\u2019ve already busted their budget, the original budget that they figure it would take. They\u2019ve had a few problems, unfortunately, developing the system, a few technical glitches here and there, and it actually inflated the amount.", "1102 I\u2019ve actually found that amount of $56 million on multiple sites reporting just how bad it was getting that -- it was a nice idea at the time. I even supported it because I thought it was a great idea to have a national broadband network. But then seeing that they\u2019ve had serious problems with it just made me realize that maybe the national level was not the best idea for it.", "1103 On a provincial level it\u2019s hit or miss if you\u2019re going to have province able to run a broadband network as well as they run some of their utilities.", "1104 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: So if the number is $56 billion in Australia and it\u2019s growing ---", "1105 MR. CARON: M\u2019hm.", "1106 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: --- and Australia is roughly two-thirds the size of the Canadian land mass ---", "1107 MR. CARON: Yeah.", "1108 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: --- do you have any idea what a similar program would cost in Canada?", "1109 MR. CARON: Like I said in my video, we have to do the research on this. This is something that I haven\u2019t anybody really produce concrete numbers on what it would cost to pursue such a program, a community network. The information that\u2019s really missing is it doesn\u2019t always take into account the technologies that are being developed.", "1110 I mean, I have some pieces of equipment. I have a device with me. This thing would have cost -- like, 20 years ago it would have been a computer that cost you a couple thousand dollars. Now I buy this little thing on line; it\u2019s called a Raspberry Pie and it only cost me, I think it was, like, $50 just for the board.", "1111 We\u2019ve evolved so much in technology. Technology\u2019s evolving so fast and it\u2019s bringing solutions forward much faster than I believe the regulatory regime is able to handle or even to catch up. I\u2019d like to see some research done that takes into account the possibility of technology being released -- being developed to actually solve a lot of these problems at minimal cost. ", "1112 Even my gadget that I saw, a lot of the technology already exists. You\u2019ve got the solar panels; you\u2019ve got the turbine. The system core is actually the part that\u2019s still a big question mark but everything else is all part of equipment that already exists on the market; it\u2019s just a matter of seeing what can we do with it and how can we push this technology forward in such a way that we realize -- do the studies to find out if we really need to spend that much to develop and to market the -- and to produce these technologies.", "1113 We could end up in a situation where these kind of relay towers, if the idea is even feasible, could cost one-tenth of what it would cost normally to run fibre all the way up to the north. Suddenly you have a much more attractive proposition; in wiring up the north they would get the service and we\u2019d find a way to cut the cost to a point where it would be feasible for the government. ", "1114 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: What if the community didn\u2019t want to take up the challenge?", "1115 MR. CARON: They don\u2019t have to; this would be entirely voluntary.", "1116 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Entirely voluntary?", "1117 MR. CARON: The communities have -- this is another thing I\u2019d like to see. It\u2019s a bit of a reflection of what I\u2019ve been seeing at the hearings, is that a lot of people, a lot of communities, a lot of government entities, they always come here and they say about what are there current problems and maybe to a certain level what they need but nobody seems to ever bring up any solutions on how they want to accomplish it. ", "1118 So this would give them an opportunity -- this project, if it ever comes to fruition, would actually encourage communities to work a bit to bring a proposal forward on how they would wire up their community, and then they would actually apply to the government for the funding necessary to actually build the network. It would be voluntary but it would require the communities to work a bit to get the kind of service that maybe for a very long time they\u2019ve never been able to receive from the existing service providers or last-mile owners.", "1119 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: If, be it a community, be it an organization, be it a TSP, received federal government funding to deploy a network in a given region ---", "1120 MR. CARON: Yes.", "1121 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Should they have an obligation to serve every single ---", "1122 MR. CARON: No.", "1123 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: --- individual and residence within that community?", "1124 MR. CARON: No, not necessarily. There\u2019s going to be some spots where the service may be adequate and where it doesn\u2019t need to be covered but it would be -- I\u2019d say it would be at least at minimum that it would -- they would have to at least provide service to the areas that actually really need it the most, where there -- where it\u2019s actually becoming an impedence to their daily lives. ", "1125 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: If organizations in your model, the community, were to deploy a network, should those rates be regulated, what they can charge?", "1126 MR. CARON: I would say, if you want to regulate it, I would -- the best thing I could find is maybe putting a limit on the salaries paid to some of the upper managements because I -- we\u2019ve see a few horror stories about that at certain times in certain sectors.", "1127 I would say probably the full operating costs of the network plus maybe 10 percent and then use that as a base for leasing the network to the other service providers. ", "1128 There\u2019s also the possibility if it\u2019s a consortium of multiple municipalities working together to provide service to an entire area including the interconnects between the communities. In that case I would like to see -- I would probably put in the same principle where it would be the cost plus 10 percent and then you lease that out to any service provider who wants to deliver services to the individual customers.", "1129 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: In your video you also note that the municipality would have to maintain ownership for a minimum of 10 years and then after that ---", "1130 MR. CARON: Yeah.", "1131 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: --- they could divest themselves of those assets but they couldn\u2019t sell it to another service provider.", "1132 MR. CARON: Yeah.", "1133 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: So ---", "1134 MR. CARON: I\u2019ve got another cheat sheet for that. Unfortunately, Ottawa has had that experience where they had a fibre-based network and they had sold it to a company. Yeah, this was -- Telecom Ottawa was owned by Ottawa Hydro. It was sold to a company, Atria, in 2008, and then Atria was sold to Rogers in 2011. So essentially Rogers bought out a publically-funded network within a span of only three years.", "1135 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: So the follow-up to that is, if they can\u2019t sell to a TSP, who else would be interested in that asset? If I owned a fibre-optic network connecting every building in a given municipality and I wanted to divest, the first people I would talk to would be the TSPs. So ---", "1136 MR. CARON: TSP? Can you just --- ", "1137 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Sorry, telecommunications service providers.", "1138 MR. CARON: Okay.", "1139 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: So, you know, I would want to be beating down the doors of some of those service providers. So if they\u2019re not allowed to sell to them, who else would be interested in that asset?", "1140 MR. CARON: Oh, no you can sell -- oh, no, the community could to sell to the transport service providers under the condition that the transport -- the telecommunications service providers also lease access to their networks to other service providers.", "1141 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay.", "1142 MR. CARON: And as I pointed out in the video, there is a challenge going on where the Commission asked that the -- ordered that the bigger companies share their fibre access to third-party service providers and then the Bell actually challenged -- I think it was Bell that challenged it in court. I think it was the day after the election was called, I believe. And that brought up an interesting situation. ", "1143 That\u2019s where I got the idea for saying that, okay, if it\u2019s a service provider, if it\u2019s a company that already owns a last-mile network, as long as they\u2019re showing access to their network to other service providers, they can also use the community\u2019s service -- the community\u2019s network to deliver their own services. But as soon as they say that they don\u2019t want to share it with anything, I don\u2019t see any reason why anybody should share their network with them.", "1144 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay, thanks for that clarification. I guess my next question would be -- let\u2019s fast forward 10 years to 2026 and \u2026 the federal government has invested $50 million to build a community infrastructure network throughout Ottawa, for example.", "1145 MR. CARON: Right. ", "1146 MR. MacDONALD: And Ottawa decides it wants to sell. What happens with the windfall? This was built with public money. Should they have ---", "1147 MR. CARON: Well, for --- ", "1148 MR. MacDONALD: --- to return that to the provincial or the federal government or would that just --- ", "1149 MR. CARON: That one, I haven't figured out what to do with that. The only thing I thought about at that point is that whichever mayor is in power at the time that sells the community network at the time that it's most needed is not going to be re-elected. So there's incentive for the politicians to hold onto their jobs. ", "1150 And also, there's the example of Hydro Quebec. As we know, it's a utility that's completely owned by Hydro -- by the province of Quebec. And even its chairman, this is the chairman that replaced Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau -- unfortunately, I don\u2019t remember who this chairman is -- and he said there's about as much chance of Quebec selling Hydro Quebec as Egypt has of selling the Pyramids. ", "1151 So if a utility is actually solid enough, if after 10 years the utility becomes solid enough that it creates a huge benefit for the community, there's very less likelihood that it's going to be sold off to anybody. ", "1152 If, however, the network is a complete disaster, then maybe it would be better off if the community got rid of it and let somebody else deal with the problem. ", "1153 I figure a 10-year period would be good enough to find out if a publicly-funded utility, a last-mile utility is viable or not.", "1154 MR. MacDONALD: Unless that municipality decided it was better to liquidate the assets to keep the snowplows on the road or build a new convention centre. ", "1155 MR. CARON: Well, that becomes a problem of managing a budget then. ", "1156 MR. MacDONALD: Okay, just a couple of other questions before I hand it over to my colleagues. ", "1157 The Affordability Access Coalition has suggested a funding model that would see funds going towards building out of network facilities --- ", "1158 MR. CARON: M'hm.", "1159 MR. MacDONALD: --- and they also suggested that a need was required to offset some of the costs that low-income Canadians are confronted with when buying communications services. ", "1160 Would you at all care to speak to that type of concept?", "1161 MR. CARON: I've actually had an idea about how to deal with that situation this morning. ", "1162 I read about it in the newspaper and realized, oh, right, the low-income people, they will need their Internet service, and in fact, it's becoming a serious problem, where a lot of them have to decide between the Internet and food. That's how important the Internet has become, to the point where they actually have to decide between one and the other.", "1163 But what I thought was, if you had like, a one gigabit ethernet connection connected to a -- just for example, to low-income housing, essentially that gigabit ethernet connection could be split up in many different ways. You can have ten 100 megabit connections or even 100 ten megabit connections. There's different ways of splitting it up, and then you end up finding out that you can actually charge a much lower rate per connection. ", "1164 This won't give them high definition streaming or anything like that, although considering they're already in a very low-income position, it's not -- probably not in their top list of priorities. ", "1165 But what would be in their priorities is to be able to access the government services that actually allow them to keep living day in, day out. And from there it would be possible to split up a gigabit connection to multiple residents, and probably even give them a rate so low that they end up paying maybe $2 or $5 a month just for, like, 25 megabits per second.", "1166 And with that, the advantage if you -- not -- I wouldn't say giving them for free would be a good idea, because if you actually have them pay a token fee and have it marked as a utility payment, even if it's just $5, it will also help their credit rating and probably give them a boost and help them try to get out of the predicament they may have been, in many cases through no fault of their own. ", "1167 MR. MacDONALD: Last week Rogers made an announcement that it was expanding its Connected for Success program throughout -- for low-income Canadians in supported housing throughout their service territory. ", "1168 If service providers are already taking these steps without being forced to and without the creation of an affordability fund, is it better to leave this to market forces to deal with versus government and CRTC intervention?", "1169 MR. CARON: The problem with such a proposition is that I don't know if that's what Rogers really wants to do or if they have ulterior motives. I really don\u2019t know what is the -- I haven't read up much on the proposition -- the proposal. I understand what it means. ", "1170 The only thing is, whenever a large company says they're doing something for the community, I always question it at this stage, especially with Bell with their \"Let's Talk\" campaigns for mental health. It doesn\u2019t seem as much as a campaign for mental health as brand reinforcement for the Bell name. ", "1171 So whenever I see these big companies do these kind of charitable events, I always put into question, what is the motivation behind it? Is it really a charitable benefit they're trying to do here or do they have any other intentions? ", "1172 MR. MacDONALD: Just switching gears for just a final few moments, can you speak to the importance of phone services, how important a traditional wire line telephone is in a day and age from -- where people can place a VoIP call or log on to the wireless network? We've seen one in five Canadians have already cut the cord. ", "1173 MR. CARON: Right. Yes, in my case it's funny, because I actually applied for a television licence many years ago and it was approved for it. And while the television channel didn\u2019t work out, that's okay, because in the end, I found out that I just cancelled my cable, cancelled my phone line. ", "1174 Right now today, just my example, everything I do is on the Internet. If I want to watch TV I just bring out the rabbit ears and if I want to make a phone call I just use my cell phone. I'm with WIND Mobile and they have some pretty decent rates there, so right now, wire line service and such, the traditional one, the analog one, I don\u2019t see that lasting very long at this stage. ", "1175 If you wire everybody up with decent Internet service, anybody can make a call very easily over data networks. Just that -- you know, there's still some adaptations that need to be done, because even though Skype seems like a convenient item and I do use it every day during my business dealings, there's still the advantage of having a network, a phone network, at least a wireless one that makes it easy to place a call to just about anybody in the world without having to worry about if you have the right Internet service plan to make it work.", "1176 So I see the wired side disappearing eventually but I don\u2019t see the wireless side disappearing anytime soon. ", "1177 MR. MacDONALD: Okay, thank you. ", "1178 With respect to the telephone directory, your business, do you use a telephone directory to advertise yourself or make yourself known?", "1179 MR. CARON: No, I have a limited number of clients. I don\u2019t really advertise that much at this stage. I deal mainly with my main client, Circa Design Corporation. That's the company with which I automate (inaudible). ", "1180 MR. MacDONALD: Okay. ", "1181 MR. CARON: So no, but even then, in terms of advertising, I think that the most advertising I do, basically, is from my websites. Just making sure that it's on Google helps. ", "1182 I have a software package that I do sell online. I don\u2019t sell it full-scale because it's not a priority for my business, but I did put it online just in case anybody needed it and I discovered that not only I've already sold it to a Russian company, and also I've sold it -- I won't name the company, but I sold it to the same company that originally made it but discontinued it many years ago. We asked for the source code, we fixed it up and then they said, \"Oh, we need it again. Can we buy yours?\"", "1183 MR. MacDONALD: So would you say that online applications have replaced the need for a traditional printed telephone directory? ", "1184 MR. CARON: I don't see it. I mean, if you need a service you just Google it. ", "1185 MR. MacDONALD: Okay.", "1186 MR. CARON: And that's -- Google has pretty much become the phonebook. ", "1187 MR. MacDONALD: Okay. ", "1188 MR. CARON: The paper phonebook, most people just put that in their recycling bin at this stage.", "1189 MR. MacDONALD: Okay, thank you. Those are my questions. ", "1190 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. I'll just check with my colleagues. Apparently no other questions. Thank you very much. Merci. ", "1191 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "1192 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. I will now ask TekSavvy Solutions Inc. to come to the presentation table. ", "1193 Please introduce yourself and your colleagues, and you have 10 minutes. ", "PRESENTATION", "1194 MR. ABRAMSON: Thank you. We'll introduce ourselves, starting from your right. ", "1195 MR. STEWART: Good afternoon.", "1196 My name is Paul Stewart. I'm the Director of Network Operations at TekSavvy. My team designs and operates our internet protocol and voice services networks, plans and delivers network upgrades, and coordinates the IP and voice networks with the underlying physical network capacity.", "1197 MS. LO: Good afternoon. My name is Janet Lo. I am the Director of Consumer Agreements. I work to translate consumer law and policy objectives, including the direction taken by the Commission into TekSavvy's consumer policies and processes. ", "1198 MR. ABRAMSON: Bram Abramson, Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer. I coordinate our legal regulatory and public policy activities. ", "1199 MR. KAPLAN-MYRTH: I'm Andy Kaplan-Myrth, Director for Regulated Agreements. I act as the point of contact for regulated agreements and tariffs and general carrier relations. ", "1200 MR. STEWART: TekSavvy is an independent telecom provider based in Chatham, southwestern Ontario, and also down the street here in Gatineau. In terms of services, we provide consumer internet and voice to more than 300,000 Canadian homes. It's what we specialize in. ", "1201 We're heavily invested in people, plant, equipment, and software development to excel at those services. We're proud to be one of Chatham's three largest employers and to be a growing part of Hull's and Gatineau's economy.", "1202 In terms of access facilities, we have a small fixed wireless footprint in southwestern Ontario and also in eastern Ontario, serving approximately 1,500 homes. ", "1203 Building and operating access facilities is a different kind of business. We do it where there's a gap in coverage and where we are the best option to get those people connected.", "1204 MR. ABRAMSON: As you'll have seen, that distinction between providing access and transport facilities and providing services that they support, is at the core of our filings in this proceeding. ", "1205 This afternoon, we'd like to speak to our submissions on broadband access and transport. ", "1206 So, first of all, access. We've asked you to redraft the basic service objective to place broadband access at its core, and that really consists of -- we've included a black line in your -- in the copy of our notes so that you can see how it compares with the current basic service objective. ", "1207 But it amounts to mandating individual line local broadband service and capability to connect to the internet via high speed data transmission made available, where feasible, at reasonable wholesale rates. ", "1208 And I guess I said \"mandated\". I want to be clear, that's an objective. How it's to be achieved is a different question, I think. ", "1209 The old basic service objective was very clear on the capability to connect to the internet via low-speed data transmission. The new objective needs to be about high-speed data transmission. I think you'll hear that lots in this proceeding, but respectfully, the distinction at its core should stay the capability to connect to an internet provider. ", "1210 What I mean is this: broadband access is physical network access delivery at the lowest layer of the telecom reference model that is practical to deliver that, bundled with no more than has to be. Internet service is a connectivity service delivered over broadband access. In other words, they're different. ", "1211 We think that both internet service and broadband access are required to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital economy, including -- digital society, including the digital economy. And both are basic as opposed to enhanced services. ", "1212 But your job in this proceeding is not to draw lines to identify which services are basic as opposed to enhanced services. It's to identify which basic services are so important and so scarce that all Canadians ought to have access to them. ", "1213 We say the answer is upgradable broadband access that supports the provision of retail internet services. And that distinction is not a new technical nor a new regulatory concept. It's at the heart of the current basic service objective, and as you said last July:", "1214 \u201cWholesale high-speed access services may be used to offer a variety of retail services, including local phone, television, and internet access services. Retail internet access services permit users to access a wide variety of services including email, the web, audio, and video services.\"", "1215 MR. KAPLAN-MYRTH: Even regions that can support competition in a lot of sectors cannot sustain significant competition for access facilities. Intuitively, that makes sense. The economic case for building out multiple parallel access facilities to the same endpoint, and leaving most of them to sit fallow, is weak. That is why access facilities pass an essentiality test in Canada.", "1216 And that is how, rather than being locked into an oligopoly or a monopoly, consumers benefit from competition, and insufficient market forces are overcome.", "1217 Commissioners, those insufficient market forces are all the more evident in markets where, but for subsidy, there wouldn\u2019t even be a single-provider monopoly. Access facilities meet the essentiality test. Subsidized access facilities certainly meet the essentiality test.", "1218 That is what we mean when we say that ordinary regulatory principles apply. There is no reason why Canadians in underserved communities should be locked into a vertically-integrated monopoly, where the broadband provider is the only one who can interconnect and offer internet services over it. There is no technical reason for it and there's no economic reason for it.", "1219 Today, we ask you to keep this distinction in mind as this proceeding unfolds over the next three weeks. When an intervenor comes before you and asks that you mandate or subsidize or that you invite your political counterparts to subsidize internet or broadband internet, challenge them.", "1220 Do they really mean that a monopoly internet service provider ought to be locked in, or do they mean that broadband access facilities are badly needed and ought to be subject to the ordinary rules that apply to scarce access facilities?", "1221 MR. STEWART: On the availability of transport facilities, there is a real problem to be solved. You can have broadband access facilities, but you need backhaul to get there.", "1222 We have asked that you not move immediately to subsidy as the solution to the transport quandary, because we do not think that this is the first step. Our experience has been that the location of transport facilities is difficult to discover, the pricing too high, and the coordination too difficult.", "1223 The first step is to see if there is someone who already has a network, who we can work with. A lot of times, however, that\u2019s still hard to do.", "1224 MR. ABRAMSON: The Commission has an opportunity to build tools and information to support the discoverability of middle mile facilities and coordinate transport opportunities where it's required, to act as a trusted and, where appropriate, confidential clearing house. ", "1225 Now, to be clear, that's not the case everywhere and it's often not the case in dense areas and places where it's obvious where to go and get transport, but it's a case where it's badly needed.", "1226 If there is no transport to get from Point A to Point B, under our proposal, an access seeker could ask the Commission to identify competitive alternatives, or consider identifying the route if there are no alternatives for potential subsidy.", "1227 But where there is insufficient competition for transport on a route, there is some transport on that route, and prices are neither just nor reasonable, then we think that section 34 of the Telecom Act requires the Commission to tariff that transport, before considering subsidizing additional players.", "1228 In other words, if there's already something there, and the issue is that its price is not reasonable, then that's the problem. ", "1229 In that regard, a big piece of the puzzle might be to take a hard look at your forbearance regime for inter-exchange private line transport. It is a forbearance regime invented in 1997 and 1999 that says that if any non-incumbent sells one 45 megabit per second circuit on a route, then policy goals would be better achieved if the CRTC does not regulate the price of transport on that route.", "1230 That forbearance regime is older than the basic service objective. So we have two suggestions.", "1231 One, on the record of this proceeding, issue a consolidated list of all of the community-to-community private line routes that you have forborne from regulation, along with the number of providers you believe operate on that route. That is information that you have within the DCS system, and on reading other parties\u2019 submissions, it would greatly benefit this proceeding. ", "1232 And second, of your own motion, launch a review of that forbearance framework. Inter-community transport matters a great deal. The time has come to examine it in light of what the framework is now.", "1233 MS. LO: Mr. Chair, Mr. Vice Chair, Commissioners, this is an important proceeding. We have seen a lot of things proposed. Today, we have emphasized that these proposals must be thought through the Commission\u2019s existing regulatory frameworks and ordinary principles.", "1234 We are happy to speak to that, and to our other proposals, like revising the $10 million rule for National Contribution Fund participation in your questions.", "1235 But we do want to leave you with one last proposal, in response to the zoomable pictures of broadband deployment that you published last week in the lead-up to this proceeding. It is a simple ask. Pictures are great, but data is much better.", "1236 We ask that the Commission strongly consider publishing the data set underlying those pictures.", "1237 As you know, there is a real lack of publicly available data on telecom network deployment. As buyers of wholesale network access, we don\u2019t even have access to data sets of where that wholesale network access is deployed. So imagine the difficulty of public interest intervenors and others who want to sustain an informed debate but don\u2019t have the data sets that would let them best contribute meaningfully. ", "1238 Thank you very much for your time and we welcome your questions.", "1239 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your presentation and your participation.", "1240 Commissioner Molnar will start us off.", "1241 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Good afternoon. I\u2019m going to start from the back and move forward on your comments today.", "1242 So on this issue of publishing data, you say that: ", "1243 \u201cAs buyers of wholesale network access, we don\u2019t...have access to data sets of where that wholesale network access is deployed.\u201d", "1244 What do you mean, \u201c...where that wholesale network access is deployed\u201d?", "1245 MR. ABRAMSON: If an end-user comes to TekSavvy and wants to become our end-user or our subscriber, we don\u2019t have any data set that we can go into and look at where, for example, wholesale network access is available to us. What we can do is push a single request for that particular address at a particular point in time.", "1246 It\u2019s not an efficient tool depending on the carrier who is -- depending on the vendor of wholesaler network access. And at times there have been, you know, out-of-date data sets and so on and some real problems with coordinating the moment-by-moment queries that we\u2019re able to do when we\u2019re able to do them especially at scale.", "1247 It\u2019s not a system that works well. If we were only to be able to use the tools that are made available to us at the pleasure of vendors of wholesale network access, customers would phone us, ask us for service and we\u2019d call them back a couple days later and tell them whether we could offer them service. That\u2019s not a sustainable model. And so we\u2019ve have to try and work around it.", "1248 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. So I\u2019m just trying to understand. So today a customer calls you and you make a request to the underlying service provider within that, I\u2019ll use the term, community. And you may make two requests I guess, you know, whether you\u2019re going to the ILEC or the cableco. And perhaps you do. And is it your thought that somehow this data would replace you making those requests?", "1249 MR. ABRAMSON: No. What we have to do is kind of triangulate what we think is available to us on best-available information. ", "1250 I mean, in our case, the more information that\u2019s available to us, the more informed a guess we can make. And so we may not be able to tell the end-user right then and there, \u201cYes, we can certainly provide you service there\u201d. We can say, \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s a good likelihood of it. We will try and schedule something and get right back to you.\u201d So the more that\u2019s out there, the more helpful it is. ", "1251 But to clear, that was meant as an example of the limited information that\u2019s available. The purpose of putting it on the public record here wouldn\u2019t be, you know, to assist the wholesale network access model. And I think that\u2019s, you know, kind of over there and we\u2019re over here. You know, if ---", "1252 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. So that\u2019s fair enough. I understood your broader request that said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve given to us pictorially, you know, big data, feed us data.\u201d", "1253 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah, absolutely.", "1254 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I was just confused a bit or surprised by what you suggested might be the use of that data because I think that you have operational, you know, processes in place that hopefully would be much more efficient than this.", "1255 MR. ABRAMSON: We do. But when you talk about big data, that\u2019s exactly the game we\u2019re into.", "1256 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes.", "1257 MR. ABRAMSON: And the more data that\u2019s out there, we\u2019ll use it in some ways but I think, you know, people use it in all kinds of different ways.", "1258 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Hopefully not that one, though, because that would not seem to be the best source of that. ", "1259 So, okay, moving backwards again, as I said, to ensure I\u2019m understanding well your discussion on transport discoverability.", "1260 I actually was a little, I guess, surprised. So from your point of view, right now where the IXPL routes have been forborne, you do not have access to information on who might be the competitive suppliers on those routes?", "1261 MR. ABRAMSON: It\u2019s happenstance. It really depends on the route. And I don\u2019t know, Paul, you may be able to speak a little bit better to this than me. ", "1262 But, you know, the example that I\u2019ll give is sort of like shopping for a house but there\u2019s no MLS. You know, you say, \u201cLook, this is the area I want to be in\u201d and maybe it\u2019s not quite where you\u2019re at; it\u2019s a completely different area. And you say, \u201cWell, who do I know over there\u201d or, \u201cWho might have some transport? Who can I call?\u201d And it\u2019s very much a -- I don\u2019t know if this is the right word, but a manual process in terms of, sort of, reaching out and just sort of seeing who might have some transport in the area; \u201cWho can I talk to? How can I get there?\u201d", "1263 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But do you consider some of this to be competitively-sensitive information? ", "1264 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah. I think that absolutely some of it -- some companies may say, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business where I provide transport.\u201d But I think before we start ---", "1265 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, then it shouldn\u2019t be our business to provide you that info; do you think?", "1266 MR. ABRAMSON: I don\u2019t agree.", "1267 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No, you think that we should tell you?", "1268 MR. ABRAMSON: No, I think that the Commission -- and I want to be clear, right? What we\u2019re asking is not, sort of, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not telling us but you tell the Commission and then the Commission will tell us by ricochet.\u201d ", "1269 What we\u2019re saying is where there\u2019s a real problem -- and I think you\u2019ve heard and will hear during these next three weeks that there is a real problem here. This is information that, to be honest, the Commission already has in many cases or can ask for. And it\u2019s not necessarily the Commission\u2019s job to say, \u201cWell, now I\u2019m just going to publish all of it\u201d. The only thing we\u2019ve asked to be published is what\u2019s already on the record. And it\u2019s a simple aggregation of decisions that you\u2019ve made in the past. ", "1270 So there\u2019s semi-annual decisions going back 15 years saying, \u201cWe\u2019re now, you know, forbearing from regulation on the following routes\u201d. And we\u2019ve suggested going further and actually saying the number of the providers on that route so that somebody might say, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know there\u2019s four different people I could be able to go to on that particular route. Maybe I should be looking harder instead of calling for subsidy.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t compromise anyone\u2019s information I hope and think.", "1271 But that said, we\u2019ve also said is where it may be sensitive, even if the Commission doesn\u2019t publish it, that where we\u2019ve described as adding a trusted clearing house would be a useful one. In other words, a carrier in rural Canada can go to the Commission and say, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know where to turn to get carriage on this route.\u201d And the Commission might say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to go ask someone who\u2019s filed that data with us and ask them if they\u2019re interested in speaking with this potential customer\u201d.", "1272 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And the notion you have that we should re-look at the forbearance regime, it is actually quite significant or I don\u2019t know. It struck me. Like you said, it was 45 megs at the time when forbearance was granted.", "1273 MR. ABRAMSON: It still is.", "1274 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah. Is there any sense that the competitive marketplace has changed or less has become available as some of the facilities have frankly been used up? Do you have any sense that there\u2019s maybe less available for competitive supply than there was?", "1275 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s hard to say without a -- I mean and that's ---", "1276 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You don\u2019t have that sense. That\u2019s fair.", "1277 MR. ABRAMSON: We don\u2019t have that data.", "1278 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I\u2019m just trying to understand what you think might be the outcome here.", "1279 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah, what\u2019s driving this is really -- I mean sure, there\u2019s a sense that there\u2019s been some consolidation in the marketplace. We\u2019ve seen a number of independent fiber players who have been acquired by incumbents in this country pretty steadily over the years. ", "1280 But sort of separately from that, I think we\u2019ve seen on the record, and that\u2019s certainly my impression in this proceeding, that there\u2019s a lot of companies in rural areas that are saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get transport at reasonable rates\u201d. These companies may not realize that that\u2019s actually the route they\u2019re looking on. It\u2019s one that\u2019s been forborne from regulation. ", "1281 And at some point just by putting that information out, by collating it in a way that\u2019s digestible for folks, I think it really creates the basis on which to move the discussion forward. It may be that we ought not to regulate pricing on rural routes where people are having a hard time finding transport; I don\u2019t know. ", "1282 But certainly if that was foregrounded and it was put to people, \u201cThis is where we\u2019re at now. Here\u2019s the regulatory framework we adopted 17 years ago or 20 years ago. Is it still appropriate,\u201d it may be something that would prove a good input into the process that we\u2019re talking about here in terms of transport, I think.", "1283 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. And do you say that that would be a first step before there would be any kind of middle mile subsidies or otherwise? Would you agree that\u2019s a terrestrial issue?", "1284 MR. ABRAMSON: Look, it\u2019s hard to know because we simply don\u2019t have that kind of information; that\u2019s part of the issue. But I would imagine so. I mean, it\u2019s hard to think that there\u2019s a lot of fiber going to the north. I don\u2019t know what the situation is with different hydro companies and so on and I don\u2019t know what fiber they\u2019ve laid. It\u2019s part of the problem we\u2019re pointing to. But I mean, that\u2019s a very reasonable hypothesis, I think.", "1285 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay.", "1286 So I left the broadband access for last because I feel I might need a little more explanation to perhaps understand your proposal. ", "1287 So your proposal of individual line local broadband and capability to connect to the internet, first off... just to -- as confirmation, you say this replaces the requirement for individual line voice service?", "1288 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes, our ---", "1289 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That\u2019s removed from the BSO? ", "1290 MR. ABRAMSON: Our proposal was that, yes. ", "1291 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So it -- is it your view that it would be appropriate for Canadians for -- and I\u2019ll use consumers again, because these folks will all be consumers of services, would and could be reliant on their IP connection for voice services?", "1292 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes, I mean I want to qualify that a little bit in two stages. ", "1293 First of all, we said that, you know, they ought to be able to rely on the retail service delivered over broadband access to them. That would typically be internet access. ", "1294 Certainly voice providers can setup over that broadband access. And as you said in your decision last July, that\u2019s one of the services that can be delivered as opposed to retail internet access over wholesale broadband, so I don\u2019t think it has to be either or.", "1295 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay so --", "1296 MR. ABRAMSON: But ---", "1297 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- not sort of a nomadic voice service, but use the broadband access for -- yes.", "1298 MR. ABRAMSON: If there were demand for it. ", "1299 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes.", "1300 MR. ABRAMSON: The nice thing would be you\u2019d be in a situation where that were doable, because the broadband access was present in communities that were high cost, because we would have found some sort of way of trying to meet this basic service objective. ", "1301 But certainly when we -- when we made our proposal it was oriented towards a world where more and more things are migrating to an internet protocol environment; that\u2019s certainly the case. ", "1302 One of the things that we\u2019ve heard today, and it\u2019s been interesting, has been the idea that while that\u2019s great, the internet just isn\u2019t always reliable. I can\u2019t always trust it. ", "1303 When I pick up the phone I know that the dial tone is going to be there and so if there\u2019s an emergency I have a lifeline. That\u2019s something that we understand. ", "1304 We offer two different voice services. We offer voice over IP, one. For TekSavvy customers that voice over IP service does not run over the internet, but it\u2019s also nomadic so that if you were to access it from some other end point it would run over the internet to our network and from there to our voice -- our voice network.", "1305 But we also offer re-sold Bell home phone. It\u2019s simply a resale service that we -- that we have and there\u2019s been real demand for it in -- especially in rural areas and I can understand why. ", "1306 And so without changing our proposal I understand the desire and the need for liability. One of the areas that you asked about in this proceeding was quality of service.", "1307 And I think I suppose that a -- corollary of this kind of a proposal no longer worked towards voice as part of the basic service objective, but work towards the underlying broadband access is to make sure that it\u2019s delivered reliably.", "1308 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Did you change your answer or did you just go back to reliable individual line local broadband?", "1309 MR. ABRMASON: No, I guess we\u2019re not changing our answer, but I\u2019m highlighting the importance of the reliability aspect to it.", "1310 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes.", "1311 MR. ABRAMSON: You know, it\u2019s something that wasn\u2019t ---", "1312 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You know many Canadians obviously participated and they did speak of voice. ", "1313 They spoke of, you know, their fixed voice and they -- actually many, many spoke of mobile voice or mobile service, you know, upon which to receive all of their services; so you\u2019re sticking to yours broadband?", "1314 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes. I mean I guess what I\u2019d say is any basic service objective clearly that we propose today won\u2019t be implemented for -- in the next week, or month, or maybe won\u2019t be -- won\u2019t be started to be worked towards for the next day, or week, or month, or even year. It\u2019ll take a little while. ", "1315 And what we think we see in the marketplace certainly is things evolving towards everything on IP. The challenge is to deliver that reliably, but I don\u2019t see voice and broadband as opposites. ", "1316 I see voice as a service that\u2019s increasingly delivered over broadband and the next generations of mobile. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed and certainly a great -- more and more we see that in fixed wireline as well.", "1317 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "1318 So the second bullet:", "1319 \u201cCapability to connect to the internet via high speed data transmission.\u201d (As read)", "1320 I understand what you intend there and then it goes on to say: ", "1321 \u201cMade available where feasible at reasonable wholesale rates.\u201d (As read)", "1322 If this is a basic service objective for Canadians, for consumers, how does \u201cat reasonable wholesale rates\u201d fit into that?", "1323 MR. ABRAMSON: I think the goal is to create an environment in which all consumers have the essential services that we decide it\u2019s essential for them to have and by doing this you enable the creation -- the delivery of those services to them.", "1324 In other words, I don\u2019t think this that this is a definition whose goal is to be sort of, you know, emblazoned on the back of stickers and said yes this is what I want in my home. ", "1325 I think the goal is to create a definition that from a regulatory standpoint will deliver that end goal. And I think that end goal is -- is reliable internet access and not being locked into only one provider who delivers it.", "1326 It\u2019s reliable voice service and not being locked into that one provider who will tell you whether you can have it or not and how much money. ", "1327 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "1328 MR. ABRAMSON: Now I do assume, and I think we do assume, that if you have someone delivering the broadband access they\u2019ll have every reason to also want to sell internet service over it.", "1329 And so it would be pretty shocking, to be honest, if somebody decided to go forward if they were subsidized to deliver this, that they used that subsidy and said we\u2019re not going to also try and earn additional revenue by providing that retail service. ", "1330 In the unlikely event that that happened and nobody else wanted to provide a retail service there either, then I think we might have something to deal with, but every market incentive points in the opposite direction. ", "1331 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "1332 I mean I understand that your focus is to create opportunities for competitive -- competition within all broadband access. I understand that. ", "1333 The BSO has traditionally been defining what end customers receive, what is it that Canadians require.", "1334 So, you know, the individual local broadband capability to connect the internet, capability to send and receive voice communications, access to competition where feasible, would that be another way of saying it where it would become more of an end-users objective versus, you know, an inter-carrier objective? ", "1335 MR. ABRAMSON: I think that may make sense, yes. I mean ---", "1336 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about? All you -- yes. ", "1337 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes. ", "1338 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Like capability for competition where feasible.", "1339 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes, capability to access that marketplace of folks who are providing services over the broadband access.", "1340 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes. So ---", "1341 MR. ABRAMSON: Which ---", "1342 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Let me ask another question, as we\u2019re in this proceeding, you know, we begin -- we begin from the status of our communication system today and have people coming with visions of 100 meg, you know, up and down and so on. ", "1343 And I mean those are wonderful visions and all of us here would love to be talking about that stuff instead of what do we do next. What do we do about the fact that there are Canadians today who have one and a half meg down? ", "1344 So talking 100 is harder, you know, when you -- when you know that there\u2019s costs for people who are still at one and a half, so. ", "1345 Would you see it to make sense to create the basic service objective for tomorrow saying that, you know, the vision is that we\u2019re transitioning to a BSO where it is broadband and, you know, access with -- to competition, and internet, and voice, and all broadband, all the time. ", "1346 However, you know, we need a -- we need a minimum standard for today and a vision for tomorrow and as we build we build to tomorrow. ", "1347 Would that make more sense so we could talk about today and, you know, all bask in the future? ", "1348 MR. ABRAMSON: I hear what you\u2019re saying and certainly, you know, a lot of times when we talk about competition we see it as part of sort of a shiny new future with all kinds of bells and whistles and so on.", "1349 I mean what will say is competition has been present over wholesale broadband access on DSL and still is present in many parts of Canada where the top speed we offer is 6 megabits per second, because that\u2019s the fastest we can do. There is no fibre to the node there yet.", "1350 We don\u2019t see those things as opposites. We believe and we\u2019ve seen -- we have experience, that competition is certainly deliverable, even where facilities -- and every community, and every environment is different, so it\u2019s hard to generalize, but -- and that\u2019s why we say we\u2019re feasible, but in many, many cases it is deliverable and is today delivered, to be honest, over incumbent networks in relatively remote areas.", "1351 And I guess what we are asking is that as the broadband -- the basic, I should say, service objective is implemented, that that not be forgotten. In other words, it's not a question either of securing that Internet access and that broadband service or of having competition for that Internet access.", "1352 If there is a good technical reason we are happy to hear it, and we have certainly incorporated into our proposal the idea that below a certain number of locations served across one's footprint. So if one serves less -- we said 25,000 locations -- then a company may not have the scale to build up that ability to deliver wholesale services.", "1353 In those instances we said all we are asking is that you be careful because what you now have is a subsidized monopoly. You have a company that by definition is being subsidized because there was no case for competition there. They are not providing wholesale access to their broadband.", "1354 And, I guess, once again, I would say you know the Telecom Act should be looked at very carefully. Internet access as a whole was deregulated some time ago. I think if we were to look at the date on that it would not necessarily be recent. There were a bunch of decisions through which it was done on different platforms. But it may be that if Internet access is an essential service or the kind of basic service that should be included in the basic service objective that having unregulated retail monopolies may not lead to the consequences that are in the best interest of users.", "1355 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I hear what you say but some of this -- I don't need to argue with you. I am just thinking you know we saw the First Mile Consortium in front of you who essentially are monopoly providers because nobody else wanted to serve and they stepped in. So you know I suppose if you ask them perhaps they would let you offer services to their communities too. Have you ever asked?", "1356 MR. ABRAMSON: I can't say that we have.", "1357 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No.", "1358 MR. ABRAMSON: We have our hands full with our current numbers ---", "1359 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But I understand the principle of where feasible, competition where feasible.", "1360 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah.", "1361 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And that should form part of what a consumer should expect where feasible and there are some parameters where -- I mean if you are subsidizing to one point it's hard to imagine that you perhaps should also subsidize competitive offers.", "1362 MR. ABRAMSON: Well, I'm not entirely sure I follow, but I guess if I have understood correctly I would say if you are subsidizing the broadband access then all the more so to make sure that that doesn't enable a vertical monopoly on the service side as well.", "1363 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "1364 MR. ABRAMSON: In other words, it's ---", "1365 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right, as long as it's -- as long as it is --- ", "1366 MR. ABRAMSON: Feasible.", "1367 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- there is a sustainable business plan for the Internet access. As I said, if you want to go into the First Mile communities ---", "1368 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah.", "1369 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- and can make a sustainable business plan.", "1370 MR. ABRAMSON: Absolutely. And I should emphasise we're on the cusp -- I should say we hope that we are on the cusp of a significant change in the architecture of how that is delivered. So if you asked me that question five years ago I would say, \"Look, a lot of this is aggregated to one point and there aren't a lot of smaller players who make a business of going to every\" -- well, of focusing necessarily on geographic areas that does exist but to a lesser degree.", "1371 We are heading towards a place and a time in which competition will be much more localized. That will be interesting.", "1372 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You've been very careful in defining your basic service objective to not identify a speed or any other characteristics. Is there a reason for that?", "1373 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes. We think it's consistent with our proposal. In other words, we have -- I mean we have been crystal clear. Broadband access isn't Internet service. It's the underlying physical access. And physical access is -- the capacity of physical access is different than the speed a provider may choose to offer over it that's also upgradable. And so we think that where you want to be is in a situation where you have physical access that will stand the test of time and over which reasonable speeds can be offered, and those speeds will change.", "1374 Your decision last week, I think, or the week before but 2016-117, the Telecom Decision, and this was the costing one, you said that you expect Internet traffic to grow by 32 percent a year for the next five years. So I would expect that any floor that we define for today would need to similarly grow by 32 percent if it's going to continue to keep pace with what's happening with the Internet for those years.", "1375 I think that when you don't have infrastructure in place that where possible -- I mean again it's hard to generalize, but can be upgraded, that's the objective that we are working towards is reliable, upgradable infrastructure. And, yes, where the choice exists that will be fibre. Other options are possible.", "1376 Certainly, we see that hybrid fibre coax, we see the fibre-to-the-node; different forms of DSL may do a lot of good for years to come and may certainly be adequate to meet demand in many areas for years to come. But where the basic service objective is currently not met; in other words the infrastructure is not there, we would assume that the objective ought to be to put in place access infrastructure that will stand the test of time that's upgradeable and that makes sense.", "1377 Yeah, we believe that that will typically be fibre.", "1378 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you think it would be reasonable for us to not define it, that we would say we want individual local line, broadband, capable of meeting future needs, undefined future needs ---", "1379 MR. ABRAMSON: I mean ---", "1380 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- scalable?", "1381 MR. ABRAMSON: --- scalable, upgradable, reliable.", "1382 If we are going to, I suppose, you know get into further detail into inserting that into the basic service objective in a way that it wasn't done the last time because it wasn't done the last time, I suppose that you can say that it meets the ability to use the applications and services that are prevalent at the time.", "1383 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You might be the only one in this proceeding who doesn't think that we need to set a number whether that number is the floor or some aspirational goal, you know. And we have heard folks. You have heard them even today saying that by defining that it defines -- you know sort of helps define funding requirements and unfortunately for some it defines the floor surface or the ceiling surface that they are receiving into those communities.", "1384 MR. ABRAMSON: I mean I hear what you saying and I do -- I guess I am trying to emphasize the reason for that is we really think that the thing that needs to be paid attention to be, if necessary, subsidized but certainly to be mandated as an objective to meet and invite the government to participate and all the rest of it, is to say we need to have in place a physical network infrastructure that can meet demand going forward. If we keep on sort of throwing Band-Aids at it and saying, \"Well, right now we think we can achieve this and hopefully that will last for a while\" then we are going to keep going to the well.", "1385 If the goal really is to say what's our objective here, not what would -- you know, what do we think we can manage in the next couple of years but what's the objective? Then ultimately the speed will be what the service provider decides that they are able to deliver over the physical network that is in place. We are very ---", "1386 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But isn't part of this -- I believe part of this is to defining what is that physical network? What are the requirements of that physical network? Not where it is today, but there are still gaps from an old target.", "1387 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah. We are happy to sharpen our pencils and spend more time looking at the demand that we do have from our end-users and applying the 32 percent growth that you have settled onto that and see where that shakes out. And I suppose that would be a minimum speed that a service provider getting access to the broadband infrastructure would need to be able to deliver over it.", "1388 I suppose in our minds at the end of the day, upgradable physical infrastructure that you are today building from scratch will be fibre and we think that fibre is adequate.", "1389 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, I\u2019m not -- well, I don't know if it's all fibre. You know there is fixed wireless, there is satellite.", "1390 MR. ABRAMSON: There is and we -- you know as we mentioned, we operate fixed wireless. We are very familiar with it. It's a good stop gap.", "1391 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So under your proposal there would be no requirement to define the Internet service that somebody would receive. You know, and I think for example the record here speaks significantly about people's frustration with data caps and the amount of capacity they have.", "1392 MR. ABRAMSON: So I agree. Look, this is how we propose to redefine the core of the basic service objective that's to be met in terms of why do we want to upgrade it or update it in that way? What is the end goal that we hope to achieve?", "1393 Yes, I can well imagine. I mean people want good, high quality fast Internet access. That is hard to deliver without the necessary physical infrastructure in place, certainly, but you are saying what does that look like, right, when you have actually achieved it?", "1394 Well, what we think we have proposed is an instrument intended to achieve it. ", "1395 But in terms of what do we hope to have achieved when we get there, sure, it\u2019s absolutely that good quality high speed reliable Internet access. And I don\u2019t disagree at all. I suppose we\u2019re focusing on a different part of the problem.", "1396 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. And maybe I\u2019ll ask if you wouldn\u2019t mind to undertake to provide us some detail.", "1397 So you say good quality. Would you be able to define how you would lay that out?", "1398 MR. ABRAMSON: Sure.", "1399 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You know, what are the parameters around jitter latency and so on that would define quality?", "1400 MR. ABRAMSON: Sure.", "1401 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You say, \u201cfast\u201d; define \u201cfast\u201d.", "1402 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes.", "1403 ", "Undertaking", "1404 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And the data as well. You know, where would you sit? What do you think is appropriate on data?", "1405 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah, I mean and I don\u2019t want to belabour the point but I -- we will certainly file that ---", "1406 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I know but you want a wholesale service.", "1407 MR. ABRAMSON: --- and we undertake to do so.", "1408 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You want us to focus on the infrastructure.", "1409 MR. ABRAMSON: Well, but there\u2019s a -- we hope that at the end that a different service provider will be in a position to make those choices based on market demand.", "1410 So if someone says, no, no, I need to offer an extremely low latency service at a much higher price over that infrastructure, I can deliver it. And somebody else says, you know what, I\u2019m going to oversubscribe more. I\u2019m going to not worry about my jitter as much, and I\u2019m going to charge way less for it over that infrastructure, they can do that.", "1411 And those would be two different offerings in that market.", "1412 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Well, thanks for that. So you think quality is a competitive element versus a base element of the infrastructure?", "1413 MR. ABRAMSON: I think that when you have competition, different service providers can come in and allow consumers to choose what kind of quality they\u2019re interested in buying.", "1414 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay.", "1415 I want to ask you something on that, as it regards data caps. Because I was really interested, I went on your Website and looked at your services, and I liked the little test you have to do to get in to decide how fast, you know, what service you need and so on.", "1416 I had to make up a postal code but -- anyway.", "1417 But I noticed that you don\u2019t cap data, I think what is it, 2:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Do you have usage through that period?", "1418 MR. ABRAMSON: I\u2019ll probably ask Paul to speak to it a little bit because he sees those statistics every day and every night.", "1419 But generally that\u2019s right. We don\u2019t -- we have a limited usage from 2:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., what we sometimes call \u201cthe wee hours\u201d. Because usage is much lower, then we simply don\u2019t need to cap data. ", "1420 And similarly, we have unlimited uploads at all times of the day because we just -- we don\u2019t need to. There is less scarcity there. It\u2019s really downloads at peak times that define how much capacity we provision for our network.", "1421 And so other times of day and things flowing the other way, we have lots of capacity for.", "1422 Paul, do you want to address that a little bit?", "1423 MR. STEWART: Yes, sure.", "1424 So yeah, if we -- you know, if we had it all graphed out, it\u2019s an aggregate of melt and definitely between approximately 2:00 a.m. and the 8:00 a.m. timeframe it drops right off and then at early morning it starts to pick back up again.", "1425 That encourages some customers to kind of go off peak more and peak -- planning for that peak capacity is our most costly part of operating at the end of the day.", "1426 And we do weekly capacity planning and we, you know, try and project and see where those numbers sit. And that\u2019s the part that hits the operational costs the most, is those peaks.", "1427 So by encouraging users to go off hours for perhaps backups to the cloud and different types of services like that, then it helps us perhaps flatten down that peak a little bit.", "1428 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So it helps you and potentially helps your customers. Do you consider that to be a competitive advantage to you that you are pricing differently?", "1429 MR. ABRAMSON: I mean I don\u2019t know if Paul -- I\u2019d say we think so.", "1430 You know, we\u2019re able to do it. It\u2019s simply -- it\u2019s of much greater cost to us.", "1431 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So if we were to define some kind of basic service that had some kind -- those elements, would that be taking away some of your competitive advantage or pricing discipline or otherwise?", "1432 MR. ABRAMSON: It\u2019s hard to say. It\u2019s a good question.", "1433 I mean for us, it\u2019s both something we think is nice for the end user. You know, we shouldn\u2019t cap what we don\u2019t need to cap. And at the same time, it\u2019s -- as Paul said it\u2019s a little bit of a behavioural nudge almost like energy utilities do, run your dishwasher at night and so on.", "1434 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, I\u2019ve had people comment to me about when Windows 10 came out ---", "1435 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes. We certainly hoped then that that would happen at night.", "1436 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And they couldn\u2019t make any more communications around Christmas because they had, you know -- I mean, that\u2019s unfortunate and unnecessary.", "1437 MR. ABRAMSON: Yes.", "1438 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That\u2019s an aside, I guess.", "1439 One more thing and I do understand that you would consider competition to be the first means of addressing issues of service, defining service, creating portable services and so on. But there has been a lot of discussion in this proceeding today on issues of affordability.", "1440 And there\u2019s kind of three different, I think, general themes around that, if you will. One is whether or not prices should be the same in urban versus rural areas or same? I mean what kind of pricing should exist in urban versus more high-cost areas.", "1441 One is whether there should be means tested; some kind of lifeline or other program to address people of lower income.", "1442 And the other thing that\u2019s been also brought up and these words are not mine. They\u2019re off the record, kind of the skinny basic for Internet service. ", "1443 Can you tell me your thoughts on those types of programs and where your company sits on that?", "1444 MR. ABRAMSON: I\u2019ll try.", "1445 So you know it\u2019s interesting. We talked a little bit about this amongst ourselves. This is, you know, something that was in the news a lot all of a sudden last week and then this week, and it really gave us the occasion to discuss it.", "1446 But first of all, on geographic disparities or what I guess you almost might call postalized pricing, whether where you are should matter as to what the price you pay is. I mean certainly, look, there\u2019s different costs in different areas. ", "1447 In the past, the Commission -- when I think about the banding for different loop bands I suppose -- has tried to get at those different costs and think about what to do with them.", "1448 You know, it\u2019s hard to take a position on whether as a matter of social policy, it ought to be, you know, one ought to cause prices to be very similar in urban areas, where it\u2019s cheaper to live, and in rural areas, where it\u2019s more expensive.", "1449 I can certainly understand, you know, speaking personally I suppose that needs would be very great; the more isolated you are, the more the Internet is an enabler of being less remote. ", "1450 But what to do with that in terms of as a social policy matter on pricing? As a company, I don\u2019t know that we would have a position on it. I mean we\u2019ve consistently tried to deliver low prices to consumers as a way of attracting people to our offering. And to say look, we\u2019re fairly transparent about our practices and one of the things that we do is try and price things reasonably, not rock bottom. And we don\u2019t believe in rates to the bottom for those who sometimes accuse some companies of doing that sort of thing.", "1451 We want to provide a good quality service at a reasonable rate.", "1452 And so, you know, as our prices become higher in a rural area, we\u2019re not able to deliver the same rate we are in an urban area, unless we either charge more in an urban area and cross-subsidize or unless there\u2019s some sort of external factor that today just doesn\u2019t exist.", "1453 Were there to be some sort of portable credit that people could take with them, we\u2019d be happy to participate in that market. But at the end of the day, what we focus on is try to deliver a good quality service at as reasonable a rate as we can.", "1454 And I\u2019m sorry that that doesn\u2019t really give you an answer as to whether you ought to subsidize rural prices to make them more similar to non-rural prices. It\u2019s just not something that TekSavvy probably is able to take a position on.", "1455 Certainly, we have customers in all different kinds of parts of Canada.", "1456 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I think it\u2019s fair if you don\u2019t want to -- perhaps you could take a position on the notion of -- of you know the skinny Internet for all provided by all ISPs.", "1457 MR. ABRAMSON: Yeah.", "1458 I mean I\u2019d like to and certainly when we saw Rogers\u2019 announcement of providing a $10 broadband offering in subsidized housing, not just in a part of Toronto or I\u2019m not exactly sure, but in I think all subsidized housing in Canada or something -- within its footprint or something of that nature, and I apologize, I\u2019m likely getting some of the details wrong. We thought that was great that they\u2019re able to afford to do that.", "1459 We -- again, we are all about affordability as a company. We\u2019ve often historically attracted people looking for a good price for Internet access. But in terms of cross-subsidizing supra-normal profits in one area to sell things below cost in another area, we don\u2019t have those kinds of margins. We pay very high wholesale rates. We're able to deliver services that we think are of good quality and very price competitive. We'd love to be in a position to sell them for 10 or $5. We wouldn\u2019t stay in business long if we made a general practice of that.", "1460 We think that -- you know, we're happy to see skinny price and skinny broadband. We think that the best way to achieve affordable rates is skinny profit margins because you have a vigorously competitive market.", "1461 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. Those were my questions.", "1462 THE CHAIRMAN: No questions from the others. I may have one.", "1463 I listened with great attention at the conversation you had because you do have a different perspective on the BSO issue and still early day. So I'll try to, you know, middling around it, although part of me thinks it sounds like a Section 7 objective as opposed to a BSO because, historically, it's been seen from the perspective of the end user.", "1464 But you've had a conversation with that and I'll reflect on it but if it is BSO in more of the classic sense and not just policy objective, who has that wholesale obligation? Because if you're going to create an obligation, somebody has to be the payee of that obligation. Who would that be in your view? Is it large and small suppliers? Is it fixed, mobile, satellite? Whose obligation is it?", "1465 MR. ABRAMSON: What we propose is that the Commission -- and we're not the only one certainly to propose this in this proceeding -- is that the Commission identify goals within defined geographic regions and invite proposals for those who are willing to bid on meeting those goals. And so the obligation would lie on the person who won the bid and signed the contract.", "1466 THE CHAIRMAN: And we would do that sort of like community by community. So it's a lot of follow-up proceedings.", "1467 MR. ABRAMSON: It is a lot of follow-up proceedings I must say. I mean the nicer -- I don\u2019t know if the nice thing but certainly one thing we do have is clear experience in this area in this country because, as we know, there have a whole wack of funding programs that have done exactly that over the years and we've, I think, developed a good expertise in Canada in creating those kinds of programs.", "1468 We participated in one program recently at the federal level. They were nice enough to put out a press release at the appropriate time about -- about our participation in that program to expand our fixed wireless footprint in southwestern Ontario and we felt -- I mean we feel it's a well-administered program.", "1469 Who ought to administer that program going forward? You know, now we're into real program delivery details that we think can be worked out once the policy direction -- if that is the policy direction that's adopted.", "1470 I think in our initial intervention we sort of took the inspiration of the Canada Media Fund which was reconstituted from the Canada Television Fund I suppose, anyway that succeeded it, and we said if the Commission wished to similarly recommend the Canada Broadband Fund and propose to fund up to half of it through the contributions of service providers using that Section 46.5 power that you mentioned requiring any TSP to contribute to a fund to support continuing access by Canadians to basic telecommunications services, then that's the BSO they refer to.", "1471 So, you know, I think that the details of this thing can be worked out and we're certainly not wedded to something called the Canada Broadband Fund or whatever it is, but we do think it's the right approach and we think it's one that\u2019s worked reasonably well in terms of striking that balance between incenting people to find innovative ways of delivering the physical network access and doing it in a way that connects it up with the local community that doesn't necessarily subsidize, you know, folks who are not as close to the ground and so on.", "1472 THE CHAIRMAN: Having been involved in the reform of the Canada Media Fund, I do have a nightmare sometimes but, anyhow, perhaps we can learn from the lessons from there if we go down that road. So much appreciated and I'll continue to noodle this idea.", "1473 I believe those are our questions and nothing from legal? No, okay. Thank you very much.", "1474 MR. ABRAMSON: Thank you.", "1475 MR. STEWART: Thank you.", "1476 THE CHAIRMAN: So we'll take a short break until 10 past 4:00 and continue with the last two intervenors.", "--- Upon recessing at 3:57 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 4:10 p.m.", "1477 THE SECRETARY: Please take your seats.", "1478 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: \u00c0 l\u2019ordre, s'il vous pla\u00eet.", "1479 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "1480 LA SECR\u00c9TAIRE: Merci.", "1481 We will now hear the presentation of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.", "1482 Please introduce yourself and you have 10 minutes.

People have also agitated for such goals, beginning with the post office, then POTS, libraries, broadcasting, and not surprisingly the internet today.", "1490 The original goal of the U.S. Post Office, for example, was to bring general intelligence to every citizen\u2019s doorstep, while also serving as a heavily subsidized vehicle for delivering newspapers across the nation with the aim of helping the nation's journalism flourish.", "1491 It largely worked. Universal postal policy, in other words, was also press, information, social and economic policy, all rolled into one. People also pushed hard to change the telephone from a luxury good for business and government into a social necessity for interpersonal communication.", "1492 In an all-IP world, universal service can build on this track record by not only bringing intelligence to every citizen\u2019s doorstep, but by helping to make that doorstep the perch from which we can see and speak to the world.", "1493 Establishing appropriate standards for and right level of adoption is not easy but the OECD, for instance, says that perhaps we can take the high point of POTS adoption as a proxy for desired levels of broadband adoption.", "1494 As FCC Chairman Wheeler is also fond of saying, neither the concept of broadband nor universal service is static. Both must be continuously revisited in light of emergent telecommunications services and people's needs.", "1495 When Verizon claimed last year that the old standard of five -- the old standard was sufficient and worth keeping, the FCC dismissed these comments as self-serving and adopted a new standard of 25 down and 3 up to be available to all Americans in a timely fashion.", "1496 At a minimum, we urge the CRTC to follow a similar course by expanding universal service to include, at a minimum, access to affordable high-speed broadband at between 25 and 30 megabits based on current uses, projected growth patterns, and international experience; to restrict the excessive use of data caps that we find in Canada; and to work closely with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada to come with a coherent policy agenda on the issues of broadband subsidies, spectrum policy, and fostering competitive markets.", "1497 Several rationales support the adoption of universal service policies: economic benefits for individuals and the economy as a whole; communication networks display public utility characteristics, and thus have an obligation to serve; network effects whereby the value of the network increases the more people use it and the more services that are supported; also mitigates social exclusion and problems of inequalities; and also recognize that the internet is now essential to the practical exercise of freedom of expression and access to information, health services and education.", "1498 The pursuit of universal service, of course, must also be mindful that the cost of achieving it should not interfere with --must be mindful of the cost of achieving it; also be mindful of not interfering with market forces that could deter network investment; reinforcing incumbent firms\u2019 dominance by requiring others to finance their network expansion in underserved areas; and the need to be future proof so as not to lock in developments down the road into the standards of today.", "1499 There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to universal service policies. Most countries do not legislate specific broadband speed benchmarks but pursue broadband targets as a matter of public policy, developed and back-stopped by regulators and policy-makers who have the legal and political mandate to do what they need to do to achieve outcomes that are in the public interest.", "1500 The number of national broadband plans worldwide has soared from 34 in 2007 to over 148 in 2014. When well done, such initiatives set out meaningful and achievable broadband access and adoption goals. They allocate resources fit for the task and establish specific timelines.", "1501 Let\u2019s take an example to illustrate the point, the United States. In 2015, the FCC set the goal to ensure that all Americans have access to actual download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second and actual upload speeds of at least 3 megabits per second. It did not point to an explicit legal mandate to do this, but rather to the requirements of the Telecommunications Act that it take steps necessary to ensure that all Americans have the capability to originate and to receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video services. The Telecommunications Act in Canada points in a similar direction.", "1502 The FCC\u2019s efforts are also backed by a significant amount of funding, as well as the injunction that these targets should be met in a very timely fashion.", "1503 We can also look to the European Commission\u2019s Digital Agenda and see that it too is instructive. Once again, it is not a formal legal standard but a set of policy pillars designed to promote connectivity, human development, use of the internet by business and the public alike, and also digital public services.", "1504 The Digital Agenda\u2019s central aims are much more ambitious than those of either the FCC or the CRTC, and unlike either the CRTC or FCC, they\u2019re not just access goals but also adoption goals. The main ones are all Europeans will have basic access by 2013. That\u2019s been accomplished. All Europeans will have access above 30 megabits per second by 2020. At least half of all households will subscribe to internet connections above 100 megabits per second by 2020.", "1505 The Digital Agenda is not a fixed and immoveable template. The caricature of a single EU broadband model is a myth. Individual countries from Austria to the UK have a great deal of flexibility in how they\u2019re going to work with the Digital Agenda policy objective. Some see them as the floor; others, typically the less well-developed countries in central and Eastern Europe, see them as aspirational targets.", "1506 We completed a review of the EU and OECD situation outlining the broadband policies for 41 specific countries, the speed targets they\u2019ve set, the access and adoption levels that have been met, and the range of subsidies. We\u2019ve attached those to our notes today and they were submitted onto the public record in response to Telus\u2019s interrogatory of November 2nd.", "1507 The Digital Agenda has sparked significant government investment in broadband projects. At the low end of the scale, we look at Bulgaria, Romania, and Austria that spend around a buck or two per year per person and have done so over the period from 2009 to 2014.", "1508 Looking at the middle range of the scale, we find countries like Sweden, Estonia, the UK, Germany spending between $5 and $12 a year.", "1509 Standing in a league of their own and outside Europe, of course, we have Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand and Australia invest $25 and $163 per person per year respectively.", "1510 In Canada, in stark contrast, total federal subsidies over the last five years have been around $2 per person per year. We can look to the CBC for another contrast as well. It gets about $33 per person per year. So $33 per person per year for the CBC, $2 for broadband.", "1511 Too often Canadian policy-makers and incumbent operators shine a bright light on broadcast access across the backdrop of a vast land while downplaying issues of affordability and adoption. ", "1512 In some ways this is understandable; access to basic broadband is nearly universal in Canada. Coverage levels for NGA, or above 25 and 30 megabits per second, and ultrafast broadband at 100 megabits per second or more, are higher than the EU average and similar to those in the US. ", "1513 What we also need to remember is that there are at least a dozen countries in the European Union that have comparable or even higher levels of achievement than Canada\u2019s.", "1514 4G LTE coverage in Canada has been greater than the EU average for the last couple of years. However, by 2015, that gap had mostly vanished. When it comes to fiber to the doorstep, the information infrastructure for the 21st century, EU levels on average were three times those in Canada and Canada fell quite significantly behind the United States.", "1515 So the idea in some circles that the EU model has been a failure relative to the successes of the Canadian/American models is a myth.", "1516 So looking closer to home, the CRTC\u2019s goal that all Canadian households should have access to broadband of at least 5 megabits per second by 2015 has not been met. The higher up the ladder speed we go, the further away from universal coverage we have, and the less choice and competition is available. ", "1517 This is crucial for all that success and access is important when it comes to broadband internet adoption, the gap between rich and poor in Canada is stark. Two out of five households in the lowest income bracket do not have broadband and one in three do not have a mobile phone while adoption rates at the top of income ladder are nearly universal.", "1518 Canada stands modestly by international standards as well in terms of wireline and wireless broadband adoption. On wireline we used to do quite well; we ranked around 7th in 2005. We\u2019ve fallen to 11th place by 2010 and that\u2019s where we sit today. We do terribly for mobile wireless. We are now at 26 out of 34 countries.", "1519 What explains these trends? Do poor Canadians not want to use the internet? One after another, independent studies consistently point to one thing that goes a long way to explaining our low rates of adoption: the high price of broadband services in Canada as our review of the latest Wall, OECD, and FCC reports show. ", "1520 The results published in last year\u2019s Wall report, for example, show that Canada does not fare well across the board with a few exceptions. The FCC\u2019s analysis of broadband plans across 40 countries shows that prices for wireline broadband in Canada consistently fall on the high side of the scale. ", "1521 And things have got worse over time, not better. Its data on small, medium, and large-sized smartphone prices with data plans consistently show that Canada ranks at the bottom of the pack in terms of average monthly prices, or I should say, the bottom of the pack in terms of being the most expensive, and for monthly prices as well as for the cost of a gigabyte of data.", "1522 Recent OECD data for a dozen and a half wireline broadband basket similarly confirms the case with Canadian prices above average and in the bottom quartile relative to its peers in all but two cases.", "1523 Some of the operators\u2019 hired experts assert that these comparative studies are fundamentally flawed stating for example:", "1524 \u201cFor Canada...[the OECD] appears to extract list prices only from Bell...thus [making it very] difficult to reach any conclusions about the relative price of Canadian fixed-wire broadband service from these [studies].\u201d", "1525 This criticism is wrong. The OECD does not use one company as a proxy for all prices in Canada, it uses four: Bell, Shaw, Videotron, and Rogers for wireline. And for wireless, it uses three: Bell, Rogers, and Telus.", "1526 What we really need to look at is how people actually use the internet to really get a sense of what our target should be.", "1527 As we started out, Canadians have long been very extensive users of telecommunications and other electronic media since the development of the telephone at the turn of the 20th century. This continues to be the case today.", "1528 When determining what levels of service should be available to everyone, we need to consider how people actually use the internet now and how their uses will evolve in the future. The CRTC itself identifies a variety of services that already require more than today\u2019s 5 mega bits per second downstream standard for performance consistency. ", "1529 So we have a standard-definition IPTV, high-definition IPTV, high-definition video streaming, video conferencing, software downloads, and video downloads. Netflix recommends a minimum of 5 megabits per second for HD-quality video or 25 megabits for ultra high-DEF quality. Even the carriers\u2019 own websites advertise that moderate levels of streaming audio-video subscribers should use 25 megabits per second. For those who fall on the heavier side of things, they recommend 50 to 100 megabits per second services.", "1530 Despite this, the same carriers urge the CRTC to base any revised idea of basic broadband service strictly on serious uses. But we should be very mindful of such advice, remembering that what people actually do with the media at their disposal has a long and hoary history of being cast as second in line to more important users, and often frowned upon and discouraged as a result.", "1531 The U.S. Supreme Court, for example, in 1915, denied First Amendment protection to movies because they were seen as crassly commercial and aimed only at entertaining the masses rather than drawing them in to the public life of the nation. Women's early use of the telephone was also discouraged. ", "1532 While it might be easy to pooh-pooh Netflix and watching YouTube as frivolous activities, as a matter of fact, it doesn\u2019t matter if one is using Netflix or watching CPAC and the NDP Convention over the last weekend, or if you're watching YouTube for instruction videos, as I did last year to learn how to do wainscoting around the house.", "1533 There are many instructive uses of the media. It is not the task of the CRTC or the carriers to tell Canadians what they should be doing with their broadband internet connections. ", "1534 The CRTC must also take much better account of the fact that households are running multiple devices at the same time, and the fact that there are multiple users in a single household routinely using these devices over the same connection at the same time. ", "1535 The FCC currently puts the average number of devices per home at around seven. Cisco puts it around six and suggests that it's going to grow in the next five years to about 11. ", "1536 With the automated downloads and the mass commercialization of the Cloud and the internet of things, the demand for bandwidth is going -- only going to grow over the near-to-mid-term future. ", "1537 A few more points and I will finish up. Data caps and speed limits, we've already heard a lot about this today, and I think it's very important what we've heard. ", "1538 Data caps are really critical factors. And a 5 megabits per second service might be technically capable of supporting a single HD video stream, but what people quickly find is that data caps associated with lower-tier plans prevent them from fully enjoying the services that they pay for. ", "1539 Data caps are an excessively blunt constraint that discourages communication. The goal of public policy should be to encourage communication. To the extent that network congestion is a problem, it stems from peak traffic loads, not from individual usage by so-called \"bandwidth hogs\". ", "1540 Insofar that data caps are justified or can be justified, Sandvine imagines a scenario where users are allocated 200 gigabytes caps per month for use during peak periods and unlimited thereafter, a bit of a version on the TekSavvy model we just heard about. ", "1541 From an economic point of view, there's no link between charges and cost. The use of data caps also puts an unregulated pricing tool in the hands of ISPs with significant market power. Also, people find data caps confusing. ", "1542 In close, my recommendations. ", "1543 First, the Commission has the authority to bring in substantial BSO reform and should use it. ", "1544 Second, the Commission should expand universal basic service to include, at a minimum, access to affordable high-speed broadband of between 25 and 30 megabits per second based on how Canadians currently use the internet, reasonable projections of growth from a wide variety of sources, as well as international experience. ", "1545 Data caps should also be phased out, or at least, a floor associated with basic broadband put under them at say, 200 gigabytes per month for households and maybe 90 to 100 gigabytes for individual subscribers, or 200 gigabyte or gigabyte caps per month during peak use and unlimited use thereafter.", "1546 As a general principle, broadband service should be differentiated by speed, customer service, price, and other factors, not by use. ", "1547 Four, the Commission must move beyond its focus on access and geography and its research monitoring and actions to focus more on adoption and affordability.", "1548 And last, I would encourage the Commission to work more closely and coherently with Innovation, Science and Economic Development and the federal government, develop a more coherent policy agenda in relation to subsidies, spectrum, and competition. ", "1549 Thank you very much. ", "1550 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. I'll put you in the hands of the Vice-Chair of Telecom, please. ", "1551 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you, and thank you for your very thorough submissions. I hope you were generous to your students who assisted you in terms of all their hard work.", "1552 I want to start with something not a lot of people raised, and that's -- and you raise it fairly frequently -- is adoption. Why is that important as opposed to availability? ", "1553 MR. WINSECK: Yeah. I think that's the Gold Standard of what we really want to accomplish, and what we want to use as our compass for how to act, I think, instead of imputing what people need or what they even want. I think by looking at what they do, we get a good guide as to how people are thinking about the internet, how it fits into their daily life, and then we can use that as the guide for overcoming any gaps in adoption. Because it seems to me, the question is always whether or not the service is affordable. And once people have access to it, they demonstrate for us very clearly how they're going to use it. ", "1554 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So you're using adoption as a measure of affordability, in a sense, because that's what I was trying to get my head around, because you mentioned adoption perhaps even more than affordability in that sense. ", "1555 MR. WINSECK: M'hm. ", "1556 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So you're using adoption like a -- even if it was an aspirational target by the Commission, you're asking that we set that so that we can more thoroughly measure all issues around affordability? ", "1557 MR. WINSECK: Yeah. What I was suggesting here is that you put as much emphasis on adoption as you do on access, as much emphasis on adoption and affordability as you do on access and geography. We have CMR and we have reports and various studies, one after another, showing this incredible amount of detail with respect to geography and access, but correspondingly, very little information on adoption and affordability. ", "1558 And what I'm suggesting is that we recalibrate the balance between there so that we can know a lot more about these issues. From what we do know, I think there are some serious issues that we need to take account of. ", "1559 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: On Table 1 of your August 14th submission, you have charts, and they may be repeated here for all I know, but -- on availability and adoption. And one of the issues -- and you point out there that it's difficult to understand if this reflects upon affordability. ", "1560 MR. WINSECK: Right. ", "1561 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And I was curious to know if you have any data on whether it reflects upon preference, in other words, people whose internet needs are relatively modest, when you look at adoptability of higher speeds and that sort of stuff? ", "1562 Because not -- I mean, there are -- you know, in the context of this hearing and that sort of stuff and these general discussions, we're talking about a lot of discussions about people who are fairly frequent and heavy users of the internet. But there are lots of people who are connected who maybe, you know, check the weather and send a few emails a month. ", "1563 So is there any sense of personal preference, in terms --- ", "1564 MR. WINSECK: Oh, absolutely, and you know, people do make preferences, and this is why I suggest in the last -- in my last -- one of my recommendations there that we should reflect those preferences on a basis of prices, customer service, and so on. And so you can buy lower or higher speed tiers, and so we're not asking that everybody has to have, you know, a gigabit service or 100 megs to the home or even 50 or 60. ", "1565 But we are -- I am suggesting that we don\u2019t use data caps to regulate their use. And then I also think that, you know, in terms of preference, you know, that again -- you know, it kind of individuates the problem, so to speak, as opposed to looking at the adoption patterns, looking at the gap, as I said, between the high level of POTS that was achieved and where we're at now with respect to the internet, and then get to the question of affordability as well.", "1566 And so basically, I think too often, we skirt the hard issues and we focus on subjective ones like preferences and so on. ", "1567 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Can I go back to your initial submission there too? In paragraph 54, you're talking about adoptability again and the need for higher speeds. And you reference a previous hearing we had and I recall in that same hearing the company describing its experience with fiber to the home uptake, that people would take it on trial and agree that it was a superior service. ", "1568 But then when it came to the point of wanting to pay an extra $25 a month for it the response was frequently thanks but no thanks. ", "1569 Yes, this was better but it\u2019s in my mind not $25 a month better. The other stuff was actually -- it met my basic needs and therefore I don\u2019t really want to invest anymore.", "1570 In that part of your statement you seem to object to that as a market reality and I wanted to know why.", "1571 MR. WINSECK: Well for one I think it\u2019s dodging this question of price and that\u2019s why I put so much emphasis on prices here and from such a range of studies to try to show that consistently we\u2019re faced with this one reality and to me this point of view raises some very interesting issues and I want to get to that.", "1572 But I think it dodges price and I really want to insist on that point first. But it does -- it does get at this issue of demand and there is definitely a problem in terms of is demand sufficient to pay for these -- for these kinds of infrastructures. ", "1573 This has been a long standing concern. I remember the first book that I wrote on this topic 20 years ago, I dealt head on with that particular question, at that time and I had kind of a sharply formulated question. ", "1574 You know, information superhighways who wants them; right? And that was to point out that the question was that there was \u2013- there was demand -- there\u2019s questions around demand; right?", "1575 So I don\u2019t want to sit here and pretend that there are no questions around demand and so on, because I think there is.", "1576 But I also think that, you know, we have to kind of establish a hierarchy of kind of priorities here and we also have to realize that I think that price is an -- is a very extensive consideration in peoples\u2019 preferences here. ", "1577 And I think where we do see greater levels of availability and less expensive pricing options, we do have greater uptake. ", "1578 And again I\u2019ve tried to include some of that in the tables that I provided with you today, but are we going to, you know, if we were to lay out, you know, fiber to the doorstep for all Canadians are, you know, all Canadians want to -- going to want to pay for -- pay for the bill? No. ", "1579 But are we going to experience more generalized economic and social benefits from having this general purpose network? I think we will.", "1580 And will we be able to discriminate, price discriminate, on top of that general purpose network to allow people to express their preferences for lower-end services and higher -- you know, versus higher-end services, I think absolutely.", "1581 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, but just to -- to test that a little bit, when you talk about demand, the previous targets we set, five and one, demand grew that -- blew through that pretty quickly; right?", "1582 MR. WINSECK: M'hm.", "1583 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Because I can remember -- and as much as I know you said we low-balled it, at the time most folks in that hearing were asking us to look at between three and five.", "1584 So it seemed like a pushed target at the time, no matter what it seems like today, and the FCC was four at the time in terms of -- in terms of its targets, but once people got five then they accessed video; right?", "1585 MR. WINSECK: M'hm.", "1586 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You know buffering, et cetera, et cetera. But they knew if they got 10 then they could have more and the market discovered fairly quickly that people would pay more to get that.", "1587 So the demand for that, sort of, online -- for the video streaming and others, grew the market quite a bit. ", "1588 So kind of getting back to what about leaving -- and within the context of, you know, it\u2019s always incumbent upon the agents of change to prove its necessity, what about that using market forces and targeted government funding has failed?", "1589 Because it -- a reasonable person could argue that that target was not only met, but in most areas far exceeded by deferring to demand and supply market forces.", "1590 MR. WINSECK: M'hm. Yes, you know, I remember reading, you know, through the setting of that standard and I think, you know, I think I gave you guys credit for being fairly reasonable there.

WINSECK: M'hm.", "1603 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And indicating that part of that mandate might include eventual access to these enhanced services, which allow the system to grow -- grow up on its own while ensuring people have -- their basic needs are met and the market and other investment can meet their wants.

My concern here is that this distinction between basic and enhanced is substituting the Commission\u2019s judgement for personal preferences and this has -- it really does have a very hoary past. ", "1605 I mean in my field of communication and media studies, you know, the idea of, you know, that people have been consuming the wrong media or doing the wrong thing with the media, from the telephone, to romance novels, to movies, to television today, has a really long history and the idea that, you know, somehow peoples\u2019 behaviour should be kind of discouraged.", "1606 And so I don\u2019t want to smuggle in some normative judgements about peoples\u2019 behaviours under benign sounding distinctions.

", "1621 MR. WINSECK: Yes.", "1622 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Et cetera, et cetera.

WINSECK: See the problem is now we\u2019re substituting, you know, needs and want for basic and enhanced and, you know, we can keep going around this circle.

Yes.

I mean I -- you know, I go and I look at this stuff, I try to look at it with an open mind and I didn\u2019t know what the subsidy levels would look like when I compared them across countries and how things would look and I had -- I compiled them all from the EU and the OECD and Canada at the federal level.", "1659 And I was shocked, I mean, quite shocked really by the range of these things.

I mean talking access and broadband speeds and you\u2019re using European comparisons.

There\u2019s 36 million people in Canada. Surely there must be economies of scales. How fair is it to rank Canada, you know, on a chart with Luxembourg? I mean, you can fit Belgium and the Netherlands into Nova Scotia, into about two-thirds -- well, you can fit Belgium into about two-thirds of Nova Scotia, I think. Luxembourg is about the size of the City of Calgary, I think, or something like that. We got -- you know, some of those countries listed and sometimes when you look at the top 10 you could fit them all into British Columbia.

But my longer answer is I just -- I kind of reconfirmed this before coming up here today.", "1670 Seventy-one (71) percent of Canadians live in a -- in central -- census metropolitan areas. All right? So you know, it's 35 percent -- a third of the population lives in three cities.

The country is by and large blank space. ", "1672 And if there's a problem of, you know, dealing with the 10 percent of the population -- and I'm working loosely with that number -- that's in a scattered remote rural areas, then we have lots of room with subsidies to deal with it. ", "1673 But we cannot keep turning to this idea about big country, small population as an excuse for low levels of adoption and high prices, and the data caps, the things that curb and restrict what people actually do, and just taking a generally parsimonious and flinty-eyed view of what Canadians ought to have at their disposal in the internet age. ", "1674 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But just to test that, surely price has to be a feature when you look at geography, in terms of that. ", "1675 And if you look at, you know, meeting basic needs such as sovereignty, security, public safety with a telecommunications system and these vast expanses where very few people live, but they are Canadians and we do want them to live there and we do want them to prosper there, and we want economies to grow there and that sort of stuff, wouldn't it be more -- to go back to that -- first of all, isn't price an issue? ", "1676 And when we're comparing EU countries to Canada, wouldn't it be more fair, from what you said about 71 percent, to compare Toronto to France or to compare Winnipeg to Luxembourg -- which is an interesting comparison. ", "1677 But in terms of connectivity or size and that sort of stuff, in terms of challenges and economies and economies of scale, wouldn't it be more relevant to do that to people, and then compare connectivity in northern Sweden to connectivity in northern Canada, for instance? ", "1678 MR. WINSECK: I think, you know, if we compared Winnipeg to Luxembourg, we'd be shocked at the discrepancy, and --- ", "1679 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I'm not saying we wouldn't be, but I'm just saying geographically, wouldn't that be more fair? ", "1680 MR. WINSECK: No, and see, this is what I was saying about the -- I was saying about your broadband map. It's not that there are people there that I'm saying we shouldn\u2019t be serving. It's that there aren't that many people there, and they aren't being served now.", "1681 Okay, and so what are the -- if you look at the broadband map, basically you have -- you know, and you\u2019ve used your hexagon method there for identifying where there are users in a particular area of the country. And the thing is it shows that we have, you know, huge swaths of the land that (a) people aren't living in, and (b) even where there are people living in some of those areas, there are no broadband connexions. ", "1682 And you know -- yeah; so what I'm saying is we are not -- it's not like we are seeing the 71 percent of the country that lives in the 30 central metropolitan -- or census metropolitan areas are all having to subsidize the 5 or 10 percent of the population that lives in the remote areas of the country with an extra $5 to $10 a month on their internet bill or on their phone bill. ", "1683 The levels of subsidies that would be generated by the discrepancy between the costs of -- the prices of services in Canada, all right, and prices that we see elsewhere are of such a great difference that it just doesn\u2019t -- it doesn\u2019t add up. ", "1684 And what I'm saying is if we take these studies as a guide and we stop trying to disparage them for a variety of reasons; I pulled out, you know, one example today. I mean, and which it's just -- it's like dead wrong. ", "1685 I mean, the hired expert who makes appearance here -- is here generally and is part of this general kind of production of a narrative about Canada and his telecom system is dead wrong. I've known that he's been dead wrong for several years, but I finally decided, okay, I need to -- since I'm going to be here, this is the way I work. I called people at the OACD, okay, and I said, \"Look, you know, this is what's going on,\" and they directed me to the right published source where they lay out the methodology.

WINSECK: M'hm.", "1689 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Is what you\u2019re saying. I appreciate that remark.", "1690 I just want to touch -- if we go to the end of your presentation there where you summarize your recommendations, I don't want to be the guy who says this every time, but I'm going to say it again. How much does it cost to do all of those things? And who is going to pay for it? ", "1691 I mean, we've heard today Australia may be into 56 billion or something like that. I don't know. I haven't double checked that. ", "1692 MR. WINSECK: I got 42, 42 billion.", "1693 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You could run the Canadian military for three years on $60 billion. Like it's real money, right? If you're talking that kind of money, and it's got to be generated somehow. ", "1694 So help us understand what the size of the ask it is, because we don\u2019t have any money. We just have access to other people's money. So it would be important for us to know how much money we're talking about and how big the ask we might be making on a broader community in order to fulfil these things. ", "1695 MR. WINSECK: Just a second and I'll just try to figure out, you know, something that I think would be a large number for you. ", "1696 Okay, so we are looking at -- well, if we did 10 million lines, right, and we did 1,000 bucks a line at the low end, all right, we're looking at $10 billion. ", "1697 If we did 5,000 -- I'm just pulling these numbers off the top of my head in terms of these are ones that I've seen bandied about. So I don\u2019t have the touchstone for them, but 1,000 to 5,000 is a range that you see, right? ", "1698 So you know, let's just -- so if we said every one of them costs 1,000, which is probably too high already, we're looking at -- you know, we're looking at 10 to 50 billion. And then we\u2019d have to spread that out over 10 years. And then, you know, I don\u2019t -- you know, we're looking at -- so I guess we're moving up there. ", "1699 But you know -- so we're probably in the same range, somewhere around what -- you know, I'm trying to do the math really quickly. And I don\u2019t -- not good at math doing it on the fly. Like when I do these tables, I have to sit down and be very, very careful. All right, so I'm doing this on the fly.

WINSECK: So I don't think this --- ", "1703 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I appreciate that. I mean, I don\u2019t expect people to come in with a -- you know, we've done the study and that sort of stuff. But I do appreciate the -- an in the ballpark best guess, in terms of that. ", "1704 I don't have any more direct questions. My colleagues might. I'd like to add that I really appreciate and I believe my colleagues do as well. When academics or others who have no direct skin in the game other than a study take the time to put together an intervention for us, it's much more fun to have it beforehand than after the fact because it's actually more useful.

WINSECK: --- the data cap, like which one would it be?", "1712 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- could you put a priority to it?

I really tried to sharpen my pencil, so to speak, and come in with something that I really thought was kind of mapping onto current needs with some room for growth, okay.", "1720 So if we could say that the 25/3 standard is reasonable, I think the data cap is really a big -- a big problem here that needs to be whittled down to size if not eliminated altogether. I mean Sandvine had a great idea, I thought, a couple of years ago. They published it, and that was you limit the use of data caps to peak internet time and they threw out a target number for North America of a 200 gigabyte cap at peak for peak internet times that they were defining, I believe it was 7:00 to 11:00, you know standard kind of primetime and unlimited thereafter.", "1721 To me that sounded like a reasonable thing. I mean we looked at -- I looked at Cisco estimates. Cisco has already got Canadians on average households at 56 gigabytes per month and they project it is to go up around 180 by 2019. So that's why I said -- so I tried to also be reasonable there with, you know, look, either eliminate these things. That's my big ask, climb down and, you know, like, you don't get what you ask for, right, it's not just one person here. The 200 here or, you know, do it on individual, right, because we have to recognize this whole idea of a variety of users and a variety of scenarios.", "1722 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, I realize you didn't provide a priority but that's fair.

I mean I would like to ask you about video streaming but even if I put on all kinds of caveats on my questions and a journalist reports on it with all those caveats, somebody is going to slam a headline on it and all the digital media will be on it. So I won't.", "1736 But I will ask you about video conferencing because there is a neutral way of talking about the same issue, because I get your point about normative judgments. But you saw our Exhibit 1 this morning and you might have it there for you.", "1737 So video conferencing does take a certain amount of speed and one of my colleagues mentioned it would probably help -- it would probably have some impact on data caps. But if I follow your logic that we could have concurrent users in a household, perhaps even as many as six or seven, that we have to create a standard that allows six or seven people to concurrently do videoconferencing, yet our basic service obligation for telephony, voice telephony, has never envisaged more than one person talking at the same time in the house that we manage that.", "1738 So help me understand why isn't it reasonable for the Commission to ask itself is there a minimum amount that we should be concerned about but not, you know, everybody getting concurrently on the phone at the same time?", "1739 MR. WINSECK: Yeah. I mean, as I tried to say at the very beginning in my thing, this is tricky stuff and I don't envy you for having to make the decisions at the end of the day. ", "1740 I think one easy way to kind of get out of the difficult choice there is to say, you know, a telephone line didn't enable, to the best of my knowledge, multiple conversations at the same time. That just wasn't a kind of standard practice even if it was technically possible in some way. It wasn't what people had.", "1741 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "1742 MR. WINSECK: Right. And you know, but your point is well taken. ", "1743 But I guess what I am trying to do is to say be wary. There be dragons when you start to draw lines around what is basic and enhanced or wants and needs.", "1744 You know, and this is why I really think that proper respect for people is to -- and to try to -- because academics have a long history too of standing in and offering their judgments for everybody else, right. One of the big things in the last 20 years of scholarship and it just happens to be when I have kind of grown up as an academic has been this kind of backlash against academics kind of hiding their moral preferences behind a jargonistic language and just having to come clean about this.", "1745 And so what I have tried to do in my own research is to basically reflect my own experience and to say, \"Look, I am suspicious about normally judgments being a cloak behind things\" so we really -- you know let's -- my way of kind of getting out of that conundrum about not making judgments about people and telling them what they ought to do and being sensitive to anybody else doing that is to say, \"Let's look around. Let's open our eyes and let's as clear-eyed as we possibly can and non-judgmentally try to find what they are doing and then use that as our guide\".", "1746 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Okay, that's helpful.", "1747 And strangely enough, I thought you would have mentioned you know that we did go from party lines to single lines at one point, but maybe that was well before your time.", "1748 MR. WINSECK: It was well before my time but an interesting part of history nonetheless.", "1749 THE CHAIRPERSON: We find people that still, even though they\u2019re youngish, lived it because sometimes it was the reality in cottage country inevitably.", "1750 So I appreciate and I do echo my colleague\u2019s point about having folks like yourself from academia join us in the hearing, putting forward your perspective on issues and not waiting for our decisions to come out and criticizing them as, you know, often we see in certain circles and in certain think tanks.", "1751 If you have a view and -- show up and have that view tested and it\u2019s part of the game, but we probably get better outcomes in the end. So thank you.", "1752 MR. WINSECK: For sure. Thank you again for having me here.", "1753 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. I don\u2019t think we have legal questions? No. Good for you.", "1754 So Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "1755 Thank you very much, Professor.", "1756 MR. WINSECK: Thank you.", "1757 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. I will now ask Mr. Fenwick McKelvey to come to the presentation table.", "1758 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, that\u2019s a first.", "1759 THE SECRETARY: Please introduce yourself and your colleagues and you have 10 minutes.", "PRESENTATION", "1760 MR. McKELVEY: I would like to thank the Commission for the opportunity to present today at this hearing and also I would like to acknowledge and thank the Algonquin people for allowing us to meet on their territory.", "1761 I am here today to explain an important source of internet measurement in Canada. It is collected by the public and intended for public use. Along with my colleagues, we will clarify how this internet measurement inform my intervention and its potential applications to this hearing as well as the broader internet policy community in Canada.", "1762 I am joined by two experts in the field of internet measurement. To my right, Mr. Jacques Latour, Chief Technology Officer at the Canadian Internet Registration Authority or CIRA, who I have had the great privilege to help with the launch of its Internet Performance Test. ", "1763 I am also joined by telephone by Mr. Chris Ritzo, Senior Technologist at the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation. In addition to his tireless support with my intervention, Mr. Ritzo has supported the development and application of Measurement Lab across the globe.", "1764 We hope this presentation explains the value of the Measurement Lab Internet Performance Test as a source of valuable internet performance data.", "1765 In my intervention, I submitted 1.9 Gigs of internet measurement to conduct it in Canada. Data came from a test administered by a reliable third-party internet measurement initiative known as the Measurement Lab Consortium or M-Lab. ", "1766 My intervention consisted of data generated from 717,788 tests run in Canada over the course of 2014. For more information, I would like to invite Mr. Ritzo to speak about Measurement Lab.", "1767 MR. RITZO: Hello. Can anybody hear me?", "1768 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, we can. Please go ahead.", "1769 MR. RITZO: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for the opportunity to speak about Measurement Lab. And thank you, Mr. McKelvey, for the invitation.", "1770 M-Lab is a consortium of academic institutions, private foundations, companies and public interest organizations who collaboratively provide the largest open-source, open-data public interest focused internet measurement effort globally.", "1771 New America Open Technology Institute, which is a non-profit think tank in Washington, D.C., where I work provides the operational leadership of the M-Lab platform and coordinates the contributions of other partners in the pursuit of the project\u2019s mission, which is to advance internet research by empowering consumers with useful information about their internet performance.", "1772 By providing free and open internet measurement data, M-Lab supports researchers, regulators having -- in the general public and provides a sense of how the internet is performing now for them when they run a test and how it can be maintained and improved for the future.", "1773 The M-Lab project was launched in 2009 after one of the fathers of the internet, Vinton Cerf had a series of conversations with internet researchers to learn more about the challenges they face while trying to study internet performance.", "1774 The problems that emerged included lack of widely deployed servers with ample connectivity to support internet measurement experiments; the difficulty at the time of sharing large data sets with one another easily; and the lack of public resource that could provide combined performance data to policy makers or to consumers interested in understanding their internet performance over time.", "1775 M-Lab was founded to help address these problems and to promote large-scale open-source measurement of the internet.", "1776 And today, M-Lab hosts 10 active internet measurement tests at 90 measurement points in 31 countries worldwide providing tests that can be used to measure broadband speed, analyze application performance and run network diagnostics.", "1777 The result is a rich crown sourced dataset of tests conducted by consumers, year round, from all over the world. To give you a sense of that scale, in March of this year, our Network Diagnostic Test or NDT was run approximately two million times worldwide and nearly 65,000 times by people in Canada.", "1778 Those data along with the data from other M-Lab posted tests are all freely available to researchers, governments, municipalities and the general public.", "1779 In short, M-Lab is a multi-organizational collaborative initiative that supports the work of regulators in the U.S. and a number of other countries as well as the internet research community in which we were founded.", "1780 M-Lab NDT data is complementary to other internet measurement initiatives, and we are thankful for partners and researchers like Mr. McKelvey and Mr. Latour for promoting our initiative and the use of our data in Canada.", "1781 Thank you.", "1782 MR. McKELVEY: Thank you.", "1783 The Network Diagnostic Test or NDT includes many metrics to evaluate internet performance. In the context of these hearings, I would like to highlight the Round-Trip Time also known as lag or latency. It refers to the time between sending a response (sic) and receiving a response. ", "1784 Online games as well as websites rely on these short, quick interactions to function reliably. Ask any gamer and they can tell you all about lag. Data submitted suggests that latency varied from 344 milliseconds in rural areas compared to 144 milliseconds in non-rural areas. ", "1785 While it is beyond the scope of my intervention to recommend minimum ping times, it is an important metric when considering basic internet service.", "1786 My intervention also included a small sample of the potential use of M-Lab in Canada. NDT uses WeblOO standards that provide over 50 different measurements of broadband performance such as congestion in addition to mapping the route a test takes on the internet or what is called traceroutes. These traceroutes can help evaluate whether routing impacts internet performance or help evaluate Section 7(e) of the Telecommunications Act by measuring when domestic traffic travels outside of Canada or what is called boomerang routing. ", "1787 Traceroute and NDT, as Mr. Ritzo mentioned, are just two of the 10 currently active tests running on the M-Lab consortium. ", "1788 The global scope of the M-Lab project also allows for international comparisons of internet performances like the studies conducted by the OACD.", "1789 The national scope of the M-Lab data can help reveal inequities of access. Internet performance is always comparative. The data, for example, found that maximum download speed could be up to 12 times faster than the lowest speed.", "1790 I am optimistic about internet measurement in Canada due to the tremendous efforts of CIRA. As I noted in my submission, CIRA has launched a new internet measurement building on the M-Lab project. For more details, I would like to invite Mr. Latour to introduce the IPT project.", "1791 MR. LATOUR: Thank you. I am Jacques Latour, CTO with CIRA.", "1792 So what we did at CIRA, we developed the internet performance tool. It\u2019s a platform that uses the same NDT, network diagnostic tool measurement that Dr. McKelvey referenced, so.", "1793 And we added a few tests to measure the state of the Canadian internet such as IPv6 and DNSSEC adoption.", "1794 So we added CIRA; we added three M-Lab nodes specifically located in -- co-located in Canadian IXPs to measure the Canadian internet from a Canadian perspective.", "1795 So the new M-Lab probes are located in a Canadian internet exchange point in Toronto, Montreal, and Calgary and we have more to come. And these IXPs, they form the heart of the Canadian internet.", "1796 CIRA will develop and deploy an IPT portal, which is at performance.cira.ca, to measure the broadband performance of Canadians and to the new M-Lab nodes. ", "1797 So we build a portal to display on the Canadian map an aggregated view by postal code of upload, download, IPv6 adoption and the DNSSEC results on the map graphically.", "1798 So before publishing the data, CIRA, we had to ensure that the data was valid. We contracted a third-party organization to assess the quality of the data and conduct a numerical analysis. ", "1799 So the methodology consisted of univariate statistics, peer-group analysis, and outlier detection. So the intent was to make sure that we had to confident before publishing the data and making it available and it is. ", "1800 And we are confident that the data in our IPT portal can be used to measure the state of the Canadian internet.", "1801 So IPT is an evolving platform. Every day we add new features. We have over 140,000 test performed by more than 59,000 individual users in Canada.", "1802 And it\u2019s growing. We have an exciting list of new features that people keep asking us to add to entice Canadians to measure their internet performance and see where their traffic flows. ", "1803 And when we meet we measure the internet performance. We measure the quality of the performance at home. It\u2019s not about measuring the raw speed that a port or an internet access can provide.", "1804 Thank you.", "1805 MR. McKELVEY: To conclude, my intervention relies on crowdsourcing for internet measurement. ", "1806 Crowdsourcing is a term used to describe internet-enabled research where large-scale participation investigates specific research questions. ", "1807 As the Commission understands, public participation presents many challenges, but crowdsourcing remains a vital direction to the future of media policy. In the words of John Dewey:", "1808 \u201c[The person] who wears the [shoe] knows best that it pinches and where it pinches, even if the shoemaker is the best judge of how [to remedy the problem].\u201d", "1809 Crowdsourcing helps the shoemaker understand where it pinches. ", "1810 In my presentation I have demonstrated the sophistication of M-Lab and ITP, and from my understanding other participants have made productive us of M-Lab data for this hearing.", "1811 These tools also help everyday Canadians understand where the shoe pinches. The Let\u2019s Talk T.V. Survey -- the Let\u2019s Talk Broadband Survey found that a representative sample of 50 percent of Canadians did not know or did not respond to the question about their internet speed. The tools mentioned here can help everyday Canadians better understand their internet performance.", "1812 I started researching internet measurements six years ago, because I sought new ways to encourage and value public participation in internet policy. ", "1813 More than 700,000 tests later, Canadians have participated. I hope my intervention in a small part shows the value of their contributions.", "1814 Thank you very much and I welcome your questions.", "1815 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much and thank you for having brought some of your students to the hearing so that they could get a better appreciation of what the regulatory side sometimes looks like from the inside, so thank you.", "1816 I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner Molnar who has a question for you.", "1817 COMMISSIONER MIOLNAR: So one of the things that occurs when you have a three-week hearing is you get to hear from many different parties on many different issues. ", "1818 And I appreciate you coming with a different issue, a related but different issue, and to provide us information in quite a different direction than what we\u2019ve been talking about. ", "1819 And you have a lot of big data that I will be honest I have not seen, so let me help to understand this better.", "1820 And I -- you know I get that you have been able, with your data, to help inform others that are participating in here and I think that\u2019s a great use.", "1821 Help me understand how individual Canadians can use your data?", "1822 MR. McKELVEY: Certainly. ", "1823 And I would just like to acknowledge that the specificity of my hearing, in that this really is a contribution of trying to defend and explain one potential source of internet measurement in Canada to the hearing and the potential participants.", "1824 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M'hm. ", "1825 MR. McKELVEY: And so it is hopefully a valuable source of evidence, in that I felt as though if I wasn\u2019t here no one else would be able to defend or justify some of the methodology and so it\u2019s in that spirit I\u2019m contributing.", "1826 The underlying principle to me about M-Labs is one of public participation and the idea that it\u2019s a tool that enables everyday Canadians to run a small test that measure their internet speeds and that test pools into a national-wide dataset that can be used to evaluate internet policies; so two aspects run in tandem.", "1827 But the tool itself provides, and this is both with the NDT tool and with the IPT tool, a very clear explanation of what can be perceived as an actual internet speed and that is a speed running from a home computer to a centre or a major point of the internet.", "1828 So basically trying to simulate what would be the everyday experiences of a user and so a user can leave with an example of how fast and how their upload and download speed.", "1829 And so this is one, I think, important function of the tool, is media literacy. ", "1830 One of the things that we\u2019ve talked both with NDT and the M-Lab Consortium, as well as Mr. Latour and the IPT, is in ensuring that the portal itself includes frequently asked questions or ways that Canadians can learn more about their connections and be able to -- and sometimes self-diagnose what are the potential problems. ", "1831 And many times it has to do with their own internet connections that are some of the issues behind poor performance.", "1832 And so I think in some ways the portal itself is a media literacy tool and what I\u2019m excited about is the IPT is that, as it develops, is it\u2019s trying to encourage and foster Canadians to have a better understanding of their internet connection.", "1833 COMMISSIONER MIOLNAR: Thank you for that.", "1834 And you did answer part way my next question and that was going to be does your tool allow folks to understand where the constraint is? ", "1835 If their speed is constrained from what they have purchased, does it help them understand where that constraint exists? ", "1836 Because you know much better than I that it can be from the device; you know? Like, there\u2019s all kind of fail point along the network, so does it help folks to understand that?", "1837 MR. McKELVEY: As I noted in my intervention, the device -- the NDT tool and the IPT tool is not a smoking gun. I mean, there\u2019s no way of laying direct blame on what is the cause of the network malfunction. ", "1838 However, there are ways of using the tool, and home users being able to run the tool multiple times, to start to be able to diagnose their own connection. ", "1839 So in the -- if I\u2019m correct in the frequently asks questions the suggestion of unplugging your router and plugging your computer directly into the internet connection.", "1840 So all to say is that a home user might be able to diagnose up until a point where they think that it\u2019s no longer their end of the connection. ", "1841 And then it becomes -- and hopefully would stimulate, some discussion of where the end might be and hopefully be of benefit to internet service providers who are trying to say that maybe it\u2019s a connection of initial line or in a particular neighbourhood. ", "1842 So by no means can you say who\u2019s at fault, but you can say that there\u2019s some cause for concern about the performance and that can prompt further investigation.", "1843 COMMISSIONER MIOLNAR: Right. The Commission itself has published some performance results not so long ago; are you aware of those?", "1844 MR. McKELVEY: Yes.", "1845 COMMISSIONER MIOLNAR: Would they align with the kind of results that you folks are getting?", "1846 MR. McKELVEY: Yes. ", "1847 I think the thing to keep in mind is that they\u2019re complimentary projects and so what I look forward to is the release of further data. ", "1848 One of the things which is the challenge, is that the data as it\u2019s currently released is difficult to make cross-comparisons and so what I was excited by is the release last week about the broadband map. ", "1849 And one of the things that in preparing this intervention was devising the appropriate geographic information system that would allow for comparative data and trying to kind of align different big datasets in Canada.", "1850 And I think that\u2019s kind of a really important, you know, an important to make about this is that when I was designing the intervention I decided to use the Statistics Canada dissemination areas and the Industry Canada hexagon system, which I believe, although I\u2019m not entirely clear, is what\u2019s driving behind the broadband map. And so I think there is some opportunity if these data can be used and geo-located using a common GIS system, some effective use -- some effective comparison of these two. ", "1851 The one thing to note is that the SamKnows project that the SamKnows dataset that was released by the CRTC too, you know, it\u2019s a different testing methodology and that while I\u2019m not comfortable commenting on the particularities of that testing methodology, I do think it\u2019s important to realize that we can learn different aspects of how the internet performs using both of these tools.", "1852 And they offer very -- they both offer very important insight into how the internet is actually performing. ", "1853 Jacques do you have any ---?", "1854 MR. LATOUR: M'hm. Well the both tests actually measure off-net performance and I think SamKnows also measures on-net.", "1855 Meaning measuring the performance to inside a carrier and -- a telecomm service provider, is a different metrics then measuring how fast it can go to YouTube outside on the internet. ", "1856 So our test is to measure the IPT test, NDT is based on the performance from an end-user to M-Lab node. So how fast can you go outside on the internet to that node inside a Canadian internet exchange point.", "1857 And SamKnows also performs the same test as part of their test platform, so we can collaborate on both tests and align the data, make ours and the whole thing more relevant as a single dataset. ", "1858 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "1859 MR. McKELVEY: I just have -- I just wanted to just invite Mr. Rizo who is going to talk about the experiences of the SamKnows and M-Lab in the United States and particularly just comment a bit about the difference of onsite and offsite testing, if he appears from the sky. ", "1860 MR. RIZO: Thank you, Fen. As Jacques and Mr. McKelvey have indicated the -- there are different methodologies for different tests and Mr. Latour has covered the differences in your -- the -- how M-Lab tests are run to a cost-net server. ", "1861 Our servers are placed in well-connected data centres outside of the Last Mile network, so via ISPs, so our tests that people run must cross the network boundary of the ISP they buy service from and into the internet.", "1862 That methodology is the one we -- M-Lab particularly focus on, since it replicates the consumer experience of requesting content, but SamKnows as well does the same combination of on-net and off-net tests. ", "1863 M-Lab and SamKnows actually have -- we have a relationship in an ongoing way, where they provide us feedback and they use our platforms to post their off-net measurements for the FCC\u2019s measuring of broadband America program and I\u2019m ostensibly guessing they use that platform globally for other clients as well. ", "1864 So we have that existing relationship and they are collaborator and partner in M-Lab as -- and they have been from the start.", "1865 MR. McELVEY: Thanks, Chris.", "1866 MR. RIZO: Sure.", "1867 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. ", "1868 I have just one last question and I think this might be an undertaking, because you rapidly get beyond my technical capacity to understand what you\u2019re saying, so in writing is easier for me. ", "1869 You stated in here that it is beyond the scope of your intervention to recommend minimum ping times, but you did say ping times was an important element of measuring the quality of an internet connection. ", "1870 So we\u2019re very interested in defining \u201chigh quality\u201d. Would you first be able to define what you view to be the appropriate characteristics and measurements that should be contained if you were to define \u201cquality\u201d?", "1871 You know there\u2019s ping, is it -- is it -- or -- you know, what are -- what are the proper metric or measurements that we should look at in defining \u201cquality\u201d.", "1872 And if you reconsider whether or not it is within your scope or intervention to actually define appropriate standards you could include your standards too.", "1873 And can you do that as an undertaking to define those, what those metrics would be? What are the appropriate elements to measure?", "1874 ", "UNDERTAKING ", "1875 MR. McELVEY: I\u2019m not entirely sure of my like rights here, so I\u2019m just \u2013- I want to say that I\u2019m interested in understanding whether I can conduct an undertaking. I just have concerns about timing. ", "1876 Do you have to take pity on a poor professor in grading season? But I would like to discuss with my colleague ---", "1877 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You have -- you clearly have some colleagues with you here --", "1878 MR. McELVEY: And I just -- yes, I know and I would like to ---", "1879 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- and all kinds of experts. ", "1880 MR. McELVEY: I would -- I would certainly -- I\u2019m -- I would like to discuss with them whether it\u2019s feasible within the May 5th timeline and am I allowed to say that I will get back to you on whether that\u2019s feasible?", "1881 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I wouldn\u2019t think so.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "1882 MR. McELVEY: I don\u2019t -- I mean it\u2019s my first time. I really do mean it as a genuine ---", "1883 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well I appreciate that, that it\u2019s your first time, but normally people come ready for the possibility of having to answer within that timeline. ", "1884 What I might suggest is that you take it away and if for some reason you cannot meet that deadline then you raise that further in time, so is -- and try best efforts to do so; right?", "1885 MR. McELVEY: Okay. So I will just say that yes I will certainly -- that I can provide some indication of what metrics are important in the evaluation of basic internet service.", "1886 And I will particularly be able to reference that towards what M-Lab currently collects, because I think that that you -- and that\u2019s something that I can discuss with Mr. Rizo as well, because they have a history of deciding and discussing what are important metrics in evaluating actual or basic speeds.", "1887 I\u2019d like to -- I have a -- I have a further comment and then -- but before that I would like to invite Mr. Latour to speak for ---", "1888 Did you -- did you ---", "1889 MR. LATOUR: Yes, so we\u2019re going to get back on that. So one key -- there\u2019s another aspect you need to look at for basic telecommunication is in the last year we ran out of IPV4 addresses.", "1890 And I think a basic telecomm service should have -- a basic internet access should have IPV6 enabled. Because killer app -- people are going to start developing new application on the internet on IPV6, because we\u2019re out of V4, and it\u2019s mandatory that the internet is IPV4 and IPV6. It\u2019s not one or the other. The internet is both, so monitoring the basic service should be V6. ", "1891 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay.", "1892 MR. LATOUR: In this conference room the Wi-Fi is V6. ", "1893 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I -- and I think just to be fair since you were able to make your advertisement you should undertake to do my undertaking. ", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "1894 MR. LATOUR: Okay. ", "1895 MR. McELVEY: I mean, to be clear, Mr. Latour is here to help also interpret the NDT stuff. So I found the two best experts I could track down, so ---", "1896 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No and that -- and that\u2019s great and you folks are clearly experts, which is why I\u2019m looking for you folks for your input. Thank you very much, those are my questions.", "1897 MR. McELVEY: Okay, thank you.", "1898 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m looking around to see if my colleagues have any -- yes? Okay, go ahead, please, Commissioner Vennard. I\u2019ve just spilled my drink.", "1899 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: First of all, good luck with all that marking at this of year. Been there, done that. ", "1900 I have a few \u2013- just a couple of questions and some comments with respect to a couple of -- actually a couple of things. There are three different things. ", "1901 First of all, in your submission you say that you are going to talk about the tools. ", "1902 So you\u2019ve got the big dataset, which is collected in a certain way, certain parameters, certain things around that, which could be active testing, passive testing, but there\u2019s a certain set of assumptions and that dataset came from somewhere. Large as it is it came from somewhere. ", "1903 The second thing is that you also have the tool with which to mine that data, if you will, and both of those -- both the dataset itself, as well as the tool, come with a certain set of assumptions and they\u2019re -- they don\u2019t just randomly sort of appear out of nowhere. ", "1904 So I\u2019m just wondering when it comes to big data and when it comes to basically what we\u2019re talking about here is mining that big data, would there be a commercial value to that? ", "1905 Obviously you need to check with other people, so there might be something like that going on. Do you work closely with the internet service providers? ", "1906 Just wondering about that. How you shape the tool, which will shape the -- what you pull out of your data, which was shaped in the first place by a certain set of assumptions.", "1907 MR. McKELVEY: Just to be clear, I think that there's three things we're talking about. ", "1908 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "1909 MR. McKELVEY: So one, we have a tool that we've used to perform an internet measurement test, which is an active end user enabled test using web browser, and that's the NDT test. ", "1910 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So you had users that would -- you were getting the data for this from users? It wasn\u2019t just a passive see what the internet is doing? You had people? That's basically what I was referring to, is that it's a certain set of things, people, activities, or whatever, that are going there versus something like, just a random testing of, you know, latency or whatever on the internet? ", "1911 MR. McKELVEY: Yes, precisely. So the test that I was -- the NDT test and the tests in general that I'm discussing with the IPTO as well are what we refer to as crowd sourcing. But they're forms of active measurement where they actually require users to participate and initiate the test. ", "1912 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. Where did you get your users from? Like, I'm curious about that. ", "1913 MR. McKELVEY: Well, the initial -- the Measurement Lab project, as Chris mentioned, has been around from -- since 2009, and so it's one of, you know, a few but, you know, a handful of internet measurement tests that exist. And so people popularly use them as a way of analyzing their home internet speeds. ", "1914 So it's self-selecting, but it is one of the more popular tools for people to kind of select and evaluate their home internet service. ", "1915 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. ", "1916 MR. McKELVEY: So it's -- and actually, we can -- I think if Chris is listening, he might also mention that some applications too also embed NDT within their testing suites, like, so some programs actually include it. ", "1917 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. ", "1918 MR. McKELVEY: But so all to say is -- oh.", "1919 MR. RITZO: I'm here on the line. I'm happy to address that if you'd like. ", "1920 MR. McKELVEY: Yeah, do you mind? ", "1921 MR. RITZO: Not at all. So yeah, Fen, you did a nice job of explaining that our measurements are active and initiated by users. ", "1922 The NDT test is an open-source test that is developed and maintained by the Internet Too Education Consortium, and so they are a research-driven institution that developed the test and, of course, it's used in research and education networks worldwide. And we host it on the Measurement Lab servers to provide consumers with access to run that test.", "1923 And also, as Fen was alluding, because the testers have been sourced, it can be integrated into software or other websites, such as the Sierra Internet Performance tool for people who are interested in, you know, providing bandwidth performance information to the users of the sites or software. ", "1924 Sierra Internet Performance tool site is one example, but we have others as well where -- which we could talk about. Given the time, I will hold back on that, but we have a recent partnership with the City of Seattle, Washington, who is doing something very similar to what Sierra is doing, but localized for the Seattle area. They evaluate their options for providing new service via ISPs and evaluate that service. But in any case, all of the tests are initiated actively by my people. ", "1925 MR. LATOUR: And for Sierra for the IPT tool, we did standard marketing outreach with our dot.ca member base and press release and we had about 60,000 individual users test the performance tool last summer. So this summer we're planning to do another round to get more people.", "1926 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so that's how you get to the big data.", "1927 Now, what about -- you mention your tool. How flexible is that? You put in the parameters you want or whoever wants the results, who wants to mine your data?", "1928 MR. LATOUR: So there's two parts. There's the front end. So we build the front end piece to get a user to perform their own test, and then once they do their own performance test, it shows how fast it is and latency and IPV 6 and all that. ", "1929 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. ", "1930 MR. LATOUR: And then we show a map of where they fit performance-wise compared to their neighbours, so based on postal code. ", "1931 So that's a level of aggregation we have at that level, and then the data is open source inside M-Lab freely available. ", "1932 MR. McKELVEY: And just to explain and to walk you through the intervention, so in -- there were 717,000 tests run and that was data-generated from the NDT, and so some number of people and I'm not entirely sure. With the IPT, we have better data. Ran a test and that generated a number of different records. And one of the other services that M-Lab provides is a query language or a way of asking for that data.", "1933 So very simply, my intervention was, over the year course of 2014, and with the help of Mr. Ritzo into writing the scripts, I was able to extract data for all the tests that were run in Canada for 2014. ", "1934 And so it's an open source -- well, it's not -- I mean, it's a well-documented way of accessing the data and it's held in the public domain. So anybody can access it. ", "1935 So really, my intervention was just trying to do that one step of downloading the data, which is a little technical, and then the second thing, in collaboration with the research assistant, Trevor Smith, at Concordia University, who works in the Geography Department, I geo-located each test with a known GIS system, and I use two, and we use a tool called Quantum GIS. It was just -- it's the public domain. I'm just loading it up here. It's the public domain GIS system. ", "1936 And so we were able to load up those two data sites and then very simply in that tool merge them.", "1937 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm.", "1938 MR. McKELVEY: And so that's one of the things we released, the data file created from this public GIS system, and then finally, I took and extracted some aggregated portions of that data and included that as part of the intervention. ", "1939 So you can think of it as three things. There's the broad data, there was the maps that were generated at the point of these aggregations, and then finally, there was the kind of aggregated data that was released in CFB -- CSV, sorry, in kind of open source -- or, you know, just in easily accessible spreadsheets.", "1940 So the idea was, in a way, of going from NDT test, doing a little bit of legwork but nothing fancy, to actually get the data in a way that we could use and then doing a little bit of analysis of that data only -- and I would emphasize -- only to make it more legible for typical regulators. Like, my intervention wasn\u2019t performing analysis of the data itself. ", "1941 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. Yeah, I picked that part up. ", "1942 Is it continuing, your -- is the project continuous?", "1943 MR. LATOUR: Oh, absolutely. It's live right now. You can go there and anybody can run a test from home. We have a list -- a huge backlog of new feature that people want built on that. So we added, like, you can log in now and track your test, an auto-run test for a week every hour. And the backlog of feature, one of the main one I think is relevant to here is what we did is for when a user logs in, they say, \"I'm with such and such ISP and I have a package with these parameters\".", "1944 Then when you run a test, you compare your performance against what you're subscribed to and then I don't know if you noticed the radar but there's been a lot of rumble and changes and change in the landscape on how services are sold. So there's lessons learned from there.", "1945 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: It seems like it would be a very valuable tool for -- on a lot of levels for people to figure out what's going on.", "1946 I have one final question for you. You're with universities, obviously. I'm wondering, everything costs money and everything is funded. Are you funded through NSERC or where does your funding come from?", "1947 MR. LATOUR: No, we're dot.ca, so we're -- this is a project that's funded through our community investment program. ", "1948 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "1949 MR. LATOUR: So we run dot.ca domain. We have 2.4 million domain. We have -- this is one of our community projects. ", "1950 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I thought Concordia, sorry. I thought maybe you were funding it through Concordia. Okay. ", "1951 MR. McKELVEY: And just to be clear though, there was some discussion about what my -- like, how I was appearing and how I was funded, and so I used $500 of my start up money to pay Trevor Smith to do some quantum GIS mapping for me because it was a bit outside of my ability and time. ", "1952 And I have had -- I'm not paid or I have no financial relationship with Sierra. This has been something that I've been doing since 2011 and basically in part appearing at one of this year events, Jacques and I started talking about how we'd build and internet measurement platform in Canada and I'm really proud to be here today, that we've done it, and that I hope that it's really useful. And something that I know and why I'm here defending it so that Canadians across Canada might be able to learn a little bit about their internet speed and be able to contribute some more data about the internet in Canada. ", "1953 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes, that\u2019s very interesting and we appreciate your time to come here. It\u2019s interesting to have another different perspective on the things that we\u2019re dealing with, so thank you. ", "1954 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well thank you very much for having participated. We very much appreciate it. I apologize the lateness of your appearance today. ", "1955 It seems that every time we try to plan the first day of a hearing it always takes a little longer and then it speeds up near the end and so forth. ", "1956 So I apologize for that and if you are looking for a project to discuss in class or perhaps Professor Winseck as well, you might now analyze the star.com\u2019s headline today:", "1957 \u201cCRTC won\u2019t guarantee basic internet speeds, Chairman says.\u201d", "1958 You might want to look actually -- if I actually said that and how that ends up being in the media, but anyhow.

SPINU: Thank you, good morning. My name is Oana Spinu. I\u2019m the executive direction of the Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation. To my left is Darrell Ohokannoak; he\u2019s the chairman of the board and the president of the Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation, henceforth referred to as NBDC.", "1965 NBDC is thankful for the opportunity to appear before the Commission to provide additional comments. While there are commonalities in the challenges and constraints rural and remote communities across Canada face in regards to access to telecommunications services, NBDC would like to highlight that satellite-served and predominantly Indigenous communities in Canada\u2019s north are particularly disadvantaged. NBDC\u2019s comments and recommendations speak first and foremost to Nunavut\u2019s needs.", "1966 NBDC understands that this proceeding is at its core looking at two fundamental questions. Is broadband a basic service that all Canadians need equitable access to? And if so, who pays for it in unserved or underserved areas?", "1967 There does not appear to be a debate about the increasing importance broadband internet access plays in our lives. Most of the interventions, even the ones that do not support a formal recognition or funding for broadband, acknowledge this. The CRTC\u2019s annual Communications Monitoring reports reflect steady consumer trends towards higher speed plans and larger monthly data usage, and the recently released EKOS public opinion research report identifies, in the report\u2019s own words, \u201cA dramatic increase in online engagement over the last five years.\u201d", "1968 The EKOS study further reports that public opinion clearly acknowledges that access to this increasingly important telecommunications service should be equitable across the country.", "1969 Market forces have not adequately met the north\u2019s telecommunications needs, and I will illustrate this with examples from three telecommunication service providers in Nunavut.", "1970 Let\u2019s first look at NorthwesTel\u2019s modernization plan. NorthwesTel acknowledges that, ", "1971 \u201cThe services overwhelmingly demanded by NorthwesTel\u2019s customers and the territorial governments are wireless and broadband expansion and enhancements\u201d.", "1972 The modernization plan clearly states in paragraph 106 that any such expansion into satellite-served communities, which includes all of Nunavut\u2019s communities, is contingent on external funding. The only communities with, in NorthwesTel\u2019s words, a \u201cpositive business case\u201d for high speed internet are the regional capitals, where NorthwesTel currently provides DSL service. ", "1973 And I\u2019d like to point out that only Iqaluit has a full range or close to a full range of services. As well, one must assume that there is some internal cross-subsidization happening between subsidized voice and unsubsidized broadband services to allow NorthwesTel to even provide DSL service in these few communities.", "1974 Next let\u2019s look at Xplornet. The company insists that it will be able to provide 25 meg service to all Canadians by 2017. When pressed for how many customers they could service or any waiting lists or delays for northern customers, the answer remains the same. They could theoretically provide service over the entire satellite footprint and will procure additional capacity as required. ", "1975 Yet Nunavut is always last in line. Viasat 1 doesn\u2019t footprint the north and Nunavut users had to wait years for an upgrade to Anik F2 for comparable service. I use the term \u201ccomparable\u201d very generously here. And who will install the dishes for direct-to-home satellite service in Nunavut\u2019s 25 fly-in communities spread over 2 million square kilometers?", "1976 Lastly, let\u2019s look at SSI Micro, the operator of the QINIQ network in Nunavut. SSI is only able to provide service in all communities because they have received four successive rounds of federal funding to do so, most recently under the Connecting Canadians Program. But what happens when there is no funding?", "1977 Three funding programs ago, SSI received federal funding to provide service in the Northwest Territories similar to what is sold in Nunavut under the QINIQ brand. When a dispute arose with the community champion and the funding was reassigned to NorthwesTel, SSI terminated service in the majority of communities in the Northwest Territories it once used to serve. I have no doubt that if it were not for continued federal funding and the obligation to provide internet access in all Nunavut communities at the same price, Nunavut would be in a similar position.", "1978 What we have in Nunavut is market failure. Private sector providers are competing for subsidies and not customers and we are left with parallel regulated monopolies, one for voice and one for broadband, with little choice and even less progress. The growing gap between services supported through federal broadband funding in Nunavut and the average Canadian experience was detailed in NBDC\u2019s original submission a year ago. Adjusting for the 2015 Communication Monitoring Report data, the gap has become even wider.", "1979 There appears to be a tendency among some industry interventions, especially among parties that do not actually operate in the north, to be overly optimistic about the power of market forces and the potential of new technologies, coupled with a dismissal of government intervention or subsidies as \u201ca blunt instrument\u201d. NBDC insists that the financial interests of industry must be balanced with public interest and a modern interpretation of the Telecommunications Act.", "1980 Canada has made a national commitment under Section 7 of the Telecommunications Act to ensure that high quality, reliable, and affordable telecommunication services are, \u201cAccessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada.\u201d And I imagine you\u2019re going to hear that phrase very frequently in the next few weeks.", "1981 The problem is that the current interpretation of telecommunication services only includes landline telephone and dial-up internet access. Does a $20 million annual subsidy for landline voice and dial-up internet access make sense in 2016? No. Should broadband internet access be included in the definition of basic telecommunications services and supported accordingly? Yes.", "1982 So who pays for it and what do you pay for exactly? There are a few things to take into consideration.", "1983 Data from the Communications Monitoring Reports and the EKOS study highlight the increased reliance on and expectation of ubiquitous broadband and mobility. We need to look ahead and support access to the entire telecommunications basket. Users want to go seamlessly from device to device, in the home, at work, and on the move. Broadband targets should be indexed and reviewed regularly, and should include upload speed, download speed, and minimum monthly data allowance.", "1984 While there has been a lot of focus on speed, for most Nunavut users it is the limited monthly capacity that is most debilitating. The focus group data from the EKOS report highlights the self-censoring and creative workarounds that are part of life for Nunavut internet users.", "1985 The bottleneck for Nunavut is backbone and that cannot be solved with a fragmented approach where services for consumers are supported separately from services for business or government. All Nunavut users rely on the same upstream services delivered over the same inadequate infrastructure, legacy satellite.", "1986 The North needs fibre. CRTC's own satellite inquiry clearly concluded that high-throughput satellites will not meet the North\u2019s needs and that we will continue to be reliant on legacy satellite services of limited capacity and high cost.", "1987 The federal government should designate one point of contact for Arctic broadband policy. Is it the CRTC? Is it Industry Canada or Innovation Science and Economic Development? Is it Infrastructure Canada? Canada? Is it CanNor? NBDC has dealt with all of the above. NBDC respectfully submits that one federal entity needs to take the lead and coordinate a coherent Arctic broadband strategy to chart a clear way forward for fibre. ", "1988 The Commission is best placed to take on this role because the CRTC is not as susceptible to political pressures and election cycles. It will take more than one election term to develop and implement a solution and to start seeing the social and economic benefits of improved telecommunications services. Indeed, a 2012 broadband report from the International Telecommunication Union identified thinking beyond electoral cycles as a best practice. ", "1989 The report states, ", "1990 \u201cBroadband plans may be more effective when not subject to political imperatives or the need to address an infrastructure based counter-cyclical policy at times of economic crisis such as a recession. If endorsed by policy-makers as a primary component of the vision of the country's future, national broadband plans should become a permanent and on-going fixture of economic development.\u201d ", "1991 I would like to finish by highlighting some other important considerations. It is overwhelmingly remote, Indigenous communities that are at the bottom of all metrics when it comes to telecommunications services. Specific efforts should be made to ensure that Indigenous communities in particular do not continue to be left behind. Greater local involvement will ensure that services offered in Nunavut meet the needs of and are accountable to Nunavummiut, the people of Nunavut. None of the current telecommunication service providers serving Nunavut are based in Nunavut. Corporate headquarters in Yellowknife, Montreal, Inuvik, and Woodstock are worlds away from the realities of Nunavut\u2019s remote communities. NBDC believes that the Government of Nunavut and the territory\u2019s Inuit organizations also have important roles to play in the future of telecommunications in Nunavut. Their involvement should not be excluded from any funding mechanisms to support broadband in Nunavut. ", "1992 This is not just an infrastructure issue; even if you build it they might not all come. Service availability does not equal adoption; adoption and effective use should be the end goal, across all demographics across the country. ", "1993 Broadband access and use correlates closely with socio-economic inequity. The difference in home internet access between the lowest income quintile households and the highest income quintile households is almost 40 percent. Level of education is also a significant factor in internet adoption and use. As such, NBDC would like to reiterate the need for digital literacy initiatives and support for low income households. ", "1994 Telecommunications infrastructure is absolutely critical for the future of Canada\u2019s North for a number of reasons: for economic development, for education, health care delivery, civic participation, public safely. The list goes on but I would like to focus on education in particular. ", "1995 Nunavut has the youngest population in Canada. Our median age is 24; Canada\u2019s is 40. So almost half the population is or will soon be school age. ", "1996 Right now, as I speak, at this very moment, all of Nunavut\u2019s thousands of students and hundreds of teachers in the territory\u2019s 42 K to 12 schools share 50 megabits of bandwidth. Twelve (12) percent of Canadian households -- average size 2.5 persons -- have home internet access that is better than the entire school system of Nunavut. ", "1997 I feel like that\u2019s worth repeating; 12 percent of Canadian households with 2.5 occupants have better internet access than the entire school system of Nunavut.", "1998 How can you train the work force of tomorrow, the citizens of tomorrow, without adequate access to the technology of today? ", "1999 Without a serious effort to address the digital divide -- urban and rural, rich and poor, Indigenous and non-Indigenous -- the benefits of broadband will be largely reserved for the privileged. ", "2000 Thank you again for the opportunity to contribute to this important proceeding and I would be happy to answer questions. ", "2001 CHAIRPERSON BLAIS: Thank you for that very direct and blunt intervention, and we appreciate it. I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Vice-Chair Menzies.", "2002 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. ", "2003 I\u2019m going to change slightly and start where you ended when you talked about schools. Can you just fill us in a little bit and tell us how education system works in Nunavut in terms of its -- how students have access to schools in a lot of those small communities?", "2004 MS. SPINU: How they have access to schools?", "2005 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah.", "2006 MS. SPINU: Well, right now there\u2019s 42 K to 12 schools in the 25 communities and there\u2019s -- the Department of Education manages the schools. Each community has a district education authority that is responsible for the schools in their community.", "2007 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. And do they -- are they connected on internet?", "2008 MS. SPINU: They have -- there\u2019s a school network, this 50 megs that I mentioned ---", "2009 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "2010 MS. SPINU: --- is specifically for students so it\u2019s not as filtered as the government network. It once upon a time used to be part of the government network but now they kind of have this split-off network.", "2011 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And do the students at home have access to the internet as resource?", "2012 MS. SPINU: In ---", "2013 MR. OHOKANNOAK: Sorry, not all of the students have internet access at home.", "2014 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, because you have a very -- Nunavut has a very high percentage of its population that are young people, right? And they would be the generation that the internet wishes to reach, correct ---", "2015 MS. SPINU: Yes.", "2016 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- especially for -- what I\u2019m considering is the opportunities for those who do complete school at the K to 12 region, the opportunities for further training on the internet. Do those exist; are there -- is the community college accessible on the internet for online learning?", "2017 MS. SPINU: I just want to get back to your original question. In my submission a year ago I mentioned the homework gap. And as Darrell said, not all students necessarily have access at home; we see a huge difference in home internet access between communities. So there\u2019s rates of -- in one of the smaller communities, 36 percent of homes have home internet access; in Iqaluit it\u2019s 76 percent on average; for Nunavut it\u2019s 59 percent.", "2018 We see studies from the U.S. that show that low-income families with school-age children are four times less likely to have home internet access so I think this idea of the homework gap is alive and well in Nunavut.", "2019 The college has -- Arctic College has a campus in every community. It doesn\u2019t necessarily offer all the programs in every community and it doesn\u2019t do very much online because there simply isn\u2019t the capacity to do it. So people will travel to the regional campuses in Iqaluit or Cambridge Bay or Rankin for ---", "2020 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Is it difficult to get equipment like a laptop? What\u2019s involved if I did not live in Iqaluit, Pond Inlet, Gjoa Haven, Cambridge Bay? Cambridge Bay\u2019s probably different; it has a big airport. But what\u2019s the cost of getting yourself online in Nunavut? ", "2021 Or is it -- can you just -- it sounds odd -- I\u2019d order one on the internet but ---", "2022 MR. OHOKANNOAK: Yeah, today purchasing a laptop is so much easier than it was 10 or 15 years ago; nowadays you can get items shipped up for free. And we\u2019ve got a social network where when people need some spending money they\u2019ll sell their stuff on Facebook, on the internet; if they have an extra computer, they\u2019ll put it up for sale. ", "2023 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Facebook is very popular there.", "2024 MS. SPINU: ", "2025 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It\u2019s extremely popular in the north.", "2026 MS. SPINU: ", "2027 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: There\u2019s one that I was looked that was mentioned in some of the reading of the \u201cHunting Stories\u201d page; it seemed an excellent way for people to exchange their way of life and that sort of stuff. But when you talk about capacity in terms of that, how would a person normally be accessing online? Do you grab it for 10 minutes a day, or an hour a day, or -- give us a little bit of ---", "2028 MS. SPINU: Just to go back to the question about, how easy would it be to get a laptop? I think, yeah, you can order something online if you have a credit card. If you have a credit history you can get a credit card. If you have a bank in your community, you might have a bank account and have a credit history to get a credit card to order a laptop online. But the majority of Nunavut communities do not have a financial institution in the community; only a handful of communities actual have banks.", "2029 So I think while, yes, there\u2019s the possibility that you could order anything you want online, the reality is that for a lot of Nunavut residents who don\u2019t have credit cards, this whole world that online shopping opens up is not a possibility. So there\u2019s -- but it\u2019s interrelated because you need better access so you can better access so you can engage in online banking and kind of develop the credit history or whatever to be able to get credit cards and order things online.", "2030 And now I have forgotten the second question you had, sorry.", "2031 THE CHAIRPERSON: You were talking about data caps and we heard a bit about that yesterday about how that intimidates people's use of people who do have access that we heard yesterday, and you mentioned it today as well that people will use up their data cap in a week or a week or so and then not be online.", "2032 So I am just trying to get you to paint me a little bit of a picture of how the average person would use it compared to how people who were, you know, almost always online. Is it something you use five minutes a day, 10 minutes a day, an hour a day? What would be the typical use?", "2033 MS. SPINU: I think you monitor your usage on a regular basis. You see how much of your monthly cap you have used up at a particular point and you know ahead of time before you are going to do something what is the impact of this going to be on my cap.", "2034 And households in Nunavut are larger than households in the rest of Canada. So you have more people using even less capacity and especially if you have young children who want to download something on iTunes or they are trying to do their homework. They are not the ones that are going to be thinking about what's the monthly cap. That's for the parents to think about and get the huge bill at the end of the month because of their overages.", "2035 So I think that there is -- it's almost internalized. I don't know how much of it is really conscious and deliberate now because people have dealt with it for so long that I would say you don't even think about doing some things because you just know you can't.", "2036 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So what would you consider because we are discussing basic service objective, as was emphasized yesterday. What would you consider the basic need to be?", "2037 MS. SPINU: I think NBDC has shied away from putting out a particular number just because what has happened in the past, the experience that we have had in the past with federal funding programs is that, here is a program. It has taken a year to develop it. Here is the target. It's taken a year. It's going to take a year to implement it and it's going to last another three, four years.", "2038 So over the six-year period that's a plateau. This is what you have and then you hope there is another program that raises a target and then you plateau again.", "2039 So one of the challenges is that we can't just plateau for years and years and years. Whatever target there is has to be reviewed on a regular basis so that it remains relevant, because in the south you see that usage patterns change on an annual basis. People will bump up to higher service level plans. So whatever target there is needs to be reviewed on a regular basis so it doesn't stay static for a number of years.", "2040 In terms of what that actual number should be or what a starting point is NBDC's argument is that look at what the majority of Canadians are doing. They have made that decision of these are the services I need and this is how much I am willing to pay for it.", "2041 So they have made that calculation in their head of, you know, what service do I want and I am willing to pay for it. I am willing to part with my money to get that service.", "2042 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. I understand that but I don't quite get it in terms of looking at what sort of download speed, upload speed, data cap. If we were to go this route those are the sorts of things I think we would have to determine.", "2043 It would be helpful perhaps if we look at -- I hope you have seen it -- Exhibit 1 that was put in yesterday.", "2044 When you talk about what's basic needs and if we talk about e-health -- I am going to start with that, e-health, justice, education; basic services like that being able to access government websites and that sort of thing, plus obviously interconnection similar to a telephone service and be able to communicate with each other, can you give us -- would it be 5 and 1?", "2045 Is 5 and 1 a suitable target for us to name with -- some interveners for instance, have said, mandate 5 and 1 now, set a target for 20 and 5 for five years from now or roughly something like that and work towards that. I mean it's generally assumed by most interveners that whatever levels are set would be reviewed, you know, as time passes just as this process would be reviewed.", "2046 So can you give us a starting point?", "2047 MS. SPINU: I think it depends on how frequently you are going to review it. I mean if you are talking about setting a target now and then another few years, maybe reviewing it.", "2048 THE CHAIRPERSON: Try it hypothetically. Say if we reviewed it every five years, right? Where would --", "2049 MS. SPINU: Well, in five years -- five years, Cisco's latest forecasting predicts that, I think, by 2019 the average download speed in North America will be 43 megabits a second.", "2050 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "2051 MS. SPINU: So I think that there is -- you know, one of the other questions is, okay, well, what do you mean by basic and are you assuming that these are other kinds of luxury uses that you are going to have for the internet and these are the really core uses that you are going to have for the internet and what defines what is luxury and what is basic?", "2052 The reason that I'm talking about looking at what the majority of Canadians are -- what plans they are using and why that should be the basis for a target is because who can decide what's a necessary service and what's a luxury service or what's a necessary use or what's a luxury use for the connectivity? And if Canadians believe, you know, \"I need a service plan of 9 megs down and I am willing to pay for it\", they have made those decisions of I this service because of everything I want to do online with it.", "2053 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. But to try to use the telephony analogy, right, so you have a basic service where you get a phone and you have access to enhanced services, right, because when you are talking -- when you are talking about subsidy that would become part of the discussion.", "2054 I understand what you are saying in terms you don't want to give any ground on the idea that you would have the same accessibility as other Canadians and I appreciate that. But if we need it, if we need a starting point and we were to look at it and say, \"Okay, here is basic\" or \"Here is the basic service for subsidy\" and here are enhanced services and then you have access to these enhanced services what would be -- do you want the starting point to be whatever the average download speeds are in Canada? Is that what you are looking for is social equity that's --", "2055 MS. SPINU: I think somewhere close but I mean if you want to ---", "2056 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- industrial equity?", "2057 MS. SPINU: --- if you want me to put out a specific number ---", "2058 THE CHAIRPERSON: I do.", "2059 MS. SPINU: --- that's something I could consider and come back to you on. But I think right now at this very moment I don't have a particular number that I would feel comfortable saying, yes, this is what should be the standard.", "2060 I would say my initial response would be that 5/1 is not sufficient for that five-year window.", "2061 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "2062 ", "UNDERTAKING ", "2063 MS. SPINU: But what a higher target should be, I could come back to you on it if you want a specific number.", "2064 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, if you could give it some thought it would be helpful because not necessarily -- the terminology doesn't necessarily have to be the standard. It has to be the basic, the no less than. Think of it that way. It should be no less than and, ideally, it should be as much as. That would be helpful for us to work with.", "2065 MS. SPINU: I think to a certain extent if the backbone infrastructure provisioning connectivity for Nunavut were improved, the discussion about what the minimum level is would be less important because then the constraint wouldn't be you have this really limited capacity, so what is the absolute minimum service that you want?", "2066 If we have, you know, a mix of fibre and high throughput satellite so that bandwidth is not this scarce, scarce resource then I think it would be much easier for service providers to provide a reasonable level of service at a reasonable price and there would be less of a need to say, \"Oh, you have to absolutely provide this minimum level of service\".", "2067 Right now the reason that we have that need is because we are entirely satellite-served. There is limited capacity. It's very expensive and government funding for broadband in Nunavut has always said, you want our money, you have to provide this minimum level of service.", "2068 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, I understand that.", "2069 You speak of affordability and you mentioned adoption too. How do you suggest we define affordability? ", "2070 MS. SPINU: I think in one of the ---", "2071 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I mean, there could be all kinds of different definitions, so what I\u2019m trying to get at -- I mean, the server in a restaurant who lives in downtown Vancouver might think of internet as an affordability issue because of the high cost of housing there, for example. ", "2072 There\u2019s so many different variables where somebody who lives in a -- who has a lower income or a similar income in a place where there\u2019s a lower cost of housing might see it differently.", "2073 MS. SPINU: I\u2019m just looking because I think there\u2019s a question similar to that in one of our interrogatories, and I referred to -- I can\u2019t find it right now.", "2074 In terms of affordability, Nunavut has a huge income gap between very high income and very low income. And I think some of the interventions have risen issue of that. You know, why should low income telecommunications service providers in southern Canada be subsidizing service for high income telecommunications service providers in the Territories?", "2075 And I get that. I mean, affordability -- there\u2019s really high rates of food insecurity in Nunavut. So people can\u2019t afford food for themselves or their children. So on that list of priorities, broadband is probably well below food.", "2076 So there are affordability issues in the Territories and how you would define it, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if you would use CRA definitions for what the minimum -- like the basic income is. I don\u2019t know how we define that.", "2077 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Do you consider telephone service to be affordable in Nunavut right now?", "2078 MR. OHOKANNOAK: Not for everybody. These days, just to buy food, people are -- some people are no longer getting telephones. They\u2019re finding that they can contact people easier either by chatting on basic device or on Facebook.", "2079 So there\u2019s a trend of people no longer seeing a need for a landline.", "2080 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, well, that comes to one of the points you were making when you talked about -- certainly in your initial submission, you suggested that a revised BSO should make efforts to support full deployment of mobile voice and broadband in rural and remote areas. ", "2081 And I just wanted to understand that when you were speaking of that, how you were suggesting -- how ubiquitous you were suggesting that should be. And in terms of -- I mean, everywhere it\u2019s a very big place with very few people or everywhere there is a community and what sort of size of community would we be looking at in terms of your ask in that area?", "2082 MS. SPINU: Again, I think one of the -- the fundamental challenge for Nunavut is one of backbone and the last mile infrastructure is sort of on top of it. And I think it will be a lot easier to provide these other services if there\u2019s much more affordable backbone connectivity that doesn\u2019t have limited capacity.", "2083 So to provide mobile broadband, even SSI is deployment for connecting Canadians. They\u2019re going to roll out wireless technology that will eventually be not just for fixed wireless residential internet access but also for mobile. And I think that\u2019s a direction that we\u2019re already moving in because people want that mobility.", "2084 And if you\u2019re going to have the -- I\u2019m not expressing this well. There\u2019s a ---", "2085 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, why don\u2019t we -- because you\u2019ve mentioned the backbone infrastructure area. You -- I mean you suggested -- you mentioned it a couple of times here. I\u2019m curious, what do you want us to do about that?", "2086 You mentioned in your submission there were -- you actually mentioned four areas for funding: open access transport, low income subsidy, broadband deployment to schools and community anchor institutions, and digital literacy.", "2087 And I was unclear as to whether those should all be separate funds; they should all be funded from the same fund; or whether or not they should all be -- how those would interconnect with the national contribution fund. Would they be part of it? Would they be instead of it? Would they be in addition to it?", "2088 Maybe you could help us understand that a little bit.", "2089 MS. SPINU: So I think the first issue is higher capacity more affordable backbone connectivity, so that services are just more generous and more affordable to begin with.", "2090 Those other funds in terms of low income, the schools, the digital literacy, I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s entirely the responsibility of the CRTC to support those. I think, as I mentioned, there\u2019s a role for the Territorial government. There\u2019s a role for the Inuit organizations. And there\u2019s a role that Nunavut has to play in making sure that people have access to and use the services.", "2091 But the big challenge is improving the backbone. So whether that\u2019s one upfront capital investment to support fibre and high throughput satellite in the Territory to bring in the infrastructure for that; whether it\u2019s, you know, reoccurring funding, I think the model of reoccurring funding is one that works best for satellite, continued dependence on satellite, because you have these reoccurring operating costs.", "2092 So I\u2019m worried that if we go just down the route of okay, well, we\u2019ll just cover these reoccurring costs, we\u2019re never going to have the resources to actually make the big upfront capital investments to bring in fibre. And I think that that\u2019s something that absolutely has to happen long term for Nunavut.", "2093 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And you articulated in your oral presentation there that the CRTC could play a leadership role in organizing all these various areas that have been working. And you mentioned the uncertainty in the past regarding funding and how it\u2019s always -- it tends to roll out in terms of shifting governments and those sorts of things. ", "2094 So do you have a specific ask of us in terms of how we might help? Do you want ---", "2095 MS. SPINU: A financial ask?", "2096 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, is there a specific ask there in terms of funding? Because as you said ---", "2097 MS. SPINU: Well, I ---", "2098 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You mentioned open access transport. I mean these are all things you want.", "2099 So I mean this is your chance to ask for it, right? So I mean -- and some of those asks historically have gone to other places, but this is -- there are many people coming in the next couple of weeks who are asking for things. You should not be shy about asking for what you want.", "2100 MS. SPINU: Well, NBDC did a fibre feasibility study a number of years ago and the amount at that time, in 2012 dollars, was just over $1 billion for fibre in Nunavut. But I think one of the challenges is, you know, who\u2019s going to build it? Who\u2019s going to own it? What\u2019s the governance model for it?", "2101 And I think it\u2019s one of the things I alluded to in the initial submission that there needs to be a discussion about what roles the Territorial government will have, what roles the Inuit orgs will have, what role the private sector will have in bringing this forward. So that -- I know the amount; it\u2019s just who is going to do it?", "2102 NBDC, non-profit, staff of one is not going to be ---", "2103 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So $1 billion would take fibre to Nunavut?", "2104 MS. SPINU: Yeah.", "2105 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. Where to?", "2106 MS. SPINU: In our study it would cover all the communities except Sanikiluaq, which would logically be served by fibre in Nunavik, but one of the discussions that's happening now between Nunavut, Nunavik, and Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunatsiavut is this idea of a regional fibre project, because you're not going to get fibre in Nunavut if it doesn\u2019t pass by Nunavik or Newfoundland, and that's --- ", "2107 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, but there is a fibre line that goes down the east coast from Greenland to Newfoundland, right? ", "2108 MS. DANA: Yeah, Milton, but it doesn\u2019t go up into Nunatsiavut. ", "2109 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right, okay. Thanks. So now, we've kind of touched on that. ", "2110 What would be the impact of the ubiquitous high-speed internet like that on the economic development in Nunavut? I mean, if we talk about funds as an investment, and it's -- I don't think anybody makes the argument that Nunavut really constitutes a market, but people are not just consumers, they are citizens as well and need to be respected as such. ", "2111 So how would you see if somebody -- if you're asking for a $1 billion, somebody could say, okay, what's going to be the -- some hard-nosed guy says, \"What's going to be the return on my investment?\"", "2112 It doesn\u2019t have to be dollars. It can be social, it can be economic. But could you give us some sense of what a difference that would make to Nunavut?", "2113 MS. SPINU: So in parallel to the fibre feasibility study, NBDC commissioned a broadband socio-economic impact assessment and they quantified -- that study quantified some of the socioeconomic benefits. I don\u2019t have that in front of me, at this moment, but in my head somewhere. ", "2114 We're talking about annually, you know, around 20, 30 million in GDP impact. You have 10, 20 million in revenues, 200 to 300 jobs. The Nordicity Study also looked at the socioeconomic impact of improved connectivity. ", "2115 So there have been studies that have really tried to quantify in dollars and in jobs and in quality of life when improved connectivity would be -- what the benefits of it would be. ", "2116 But I would say there's also some of the testimony in the public opinion focus groups in the recent report that the CRTC produced, you looked at the commentary from the lawyer based in Iqaluit who talked about not being able to fully service his clients because of telecommunications issues. ", "2117 You talked about the teacher that said, \"Well, I can't assign online assignments because I know some of my kids don't have internet access.\"", "2118 So that, I think, is less quantified, but equally important. Yes, there's the dollars and cents impacts and there are some hard numbers. And again, I could come back to you with our study and with the numbers from the Nordicity Study. But there's those other impacts that aren't being maybe not as easy to capture. ", "2119 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, the recent federal budget targeted $8.4 billion in spending for Aboriginal and Northern investments, including 255 million for community infrastructure, of which broadband is a part. What impact do you think that will have? ", "2120 MS. SPINU: Nunavut has a massive infrastructure deficit from housing to waste water treatment to aging power plants. You name it. And I think putting broadband in the same group as those other core municipal needs doesn\u2019t really do any service to broadband because people are not going to give up clean drinking water so they have better internet access. ", "2121 One of the issues with the infrastructure funding eligibility, as it stands right now, is that broadband is actually not an eligible project under the projects of national significance. I forget the exact name of the fund, but it's not -- at the provincial or the territorial level, it's an eligible project, but at the national level, it's not an eligible project. ", "2122 So if you look at this idea of a regional fibre that goes Nunavik, Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, that's a -- you know, it is a national project and it has possibility to have quite a bit of an impact in that region. But right now, it's not an eligible project under that funding.", "2123 So the small pool of funding that's there that broadband is an eligible project for is already spoken for. The GN has already planned what they're going to do with that infrastructure funding and broadband is not in that mix. ", "2124 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you for clarifying that. ", "2125 So there's some of the interventions here, and I mentioned one yesterday, OneWeb, for instance, new technologies, low latency, low orbit, cluster satellite, satellite cluster. ", "2126 What are your thoughts on that as a possible solution, notwithstanding your position on fibre? That -- it doesn\u2019t have to be that one, but there are similar -- there are other companies working on similar technologies with those low-orbit satellites, low latency, that claim to be the solution to everything. ", "2127 MS. SPINU: I think when it's operational it's a different story. I think right now it's in kind of development and testing phases. And I would say NBDC would never rule out any possible solution that could improve telecommunications services in Nunavut.", "2128 But to put all of your hopes into new technologies that are not deployed yet without having parallel plans to advanced technologies that are deployed or could be deployed in the North would not be something that we would advocate for. ", "2129 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thanks. ", "2130 You asked us to address digital literacy as an issue. Why would it be appropriate for the CRTC to engage in that issue? Would not that be something for other people to be funding?", "2131 MS. SPINU: I think the end goal of access is use. And there -- so I understand that the CRTC's mandate is perhaps predominately on the access side, to make sure that the services are there. But I think that it's important to make sure that demographics that are disadvantaged that may have access but don\u2019t necessarily use it, that there's outreach to make sure that they do have the skills to take advantage of the connectivity. ", "2132 Whether it's uniquely the CRTC's responsibility or whether other parties have a role, yes, I absolutely agree that other parties have a role. There's a role for the territorial government in that. ", "2133 But I think it should be on the Commission's radar as something that you say we want to improve the access, but we also want to see that there is use that comes out of it, that there's adoption, and that segments of the population that are not taking advantage of the connectivity have the means to do it. ", "2134 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you very much. Those are my questions. My colleagues may have some to follow up.", "2135 THE CHAIRPERSON: You were apparently very clear. We have no further questions for you. Thank you very much. ", "2136 MS. SPINU: Thank you. ", "2148 ", "--- Upon recessing at 10:24 a.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 10:43 a.m.", "2355 THE SECRETARY: We will now here the presentation of SSi Group of Companies. ", "2356 Please introduced yourself and your colleagues and you have 15 minutes.", "PRESENTATION ", "2357 MR. PHILIPP: My name is Jeff and I am the founder and CEO of SSi Micro. Joining me on the panel today are, to my right, Dean Proctor, SSi\u2019s Chief Development Officer, and Johanne Lemay, co-president of Lemay-Yates. To my left is Chris Fraser, also a development officer with SSi.", "2358 In addition, SSi team members in Yellowknife, Kanata, Nova Scotia, BC, and even Nunavut are watching the proceedings thanks to broadband internet.", "2359 To begin, I\u2019d like to thank the Commission for their efforts over the last several years. There\u2019s been a tremendous amount of work done to improve communications services delivered to Canadians and in particular the north, where SSi started. So thank you.", "2360 I\u2019m hopeful that the current undertaking will provide the feedback required for further positive policy reform.", "2361 SSi is a northern company. Our headquarters are in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. We specialize in remote-area connectivity, providing broadband and other communications services across Canada\u2019s north.", "2362 We built the QINIQ network a decade ago and today we\u2019re still the only provider to all 25 communities.", "2363 We have seen, know, and live daily the positive impact that information technology has. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that our position in this proceeding is that broadband is a must-have service and that improving the basic service objective is a critical national issue.", "2364 Consistent with our presentations in past proceedings, we come before you today with three key messages. ", "2365 One, from a practical level, the essential nature of broadband must be recognized. And I think we all agree on this point. ", "2366 Two, from a policy level, broadband must become the core component of the basic service objective.", "2367 And three, from an implementation level, the Commission must recognize that a one-size-fits-all policy will not work.", "2368 Before I go further, let me tell you a bit about SSi and why communications in the north is personally so important.", "2369 My parents founded the Snowshoe Inn 50 years ago in Fort Providence, a town of approximately 800 people in the Northwest Territories. Twenty-five (25) years ago, my wife Stephanie, who\u2019s also our CFO, and I started SSi Micro. Our mission is to ensure that all northern communities have affordable, high-quality internet access. And to achieve this grand vision we\u2019ve had to invest heavily in facilities and infrastructure.", "2370 To put this in perspective, in 2005 SSi was the first company to launch broadband service in Nunavut. It did not exist prior to our arrival. To this day, we\u2019re still the only provider in the majority of the communities and we\u2019re the only company to offer the same broadband packages at the same price in every market no matter how small.", "2371 In 2011, the Commission determined that, ", "2372 \u201cCanadians who reside in the north should be able to enjoy the full benefits of competition.\u201d ", "2373 The Commission decided to introduce local competition in NorthwesTel\u2019s territory to provide a choice of service providers and different service options.", "2374 That decision enabled SSi to move forward with additional investment, delivering on the goal to provide more choice and innovation to northern consumers. It has taken considerable money and effort, but the new network infrastructure is now in place and we will soon complete our first interconnection arrangements with NorthwesTel.", "2375 Unfortunately, without further policy changes and inclusion of broadband as part of the basic service objective, remote areas in Canada will suffer.", "2376 This is the issue that concerns us most and which we will focus on today.", "2377 SSi has consistently advocated for a holistic approach to address the communications challenges and needs in the north. The Government of Nunavut noted that a holistic approach means more than, ", "2378 \u201cProposing little Band-Aids of this subsidy here and that grant there. We need a coherent plan for the whole thing.\u201d", "2379 We could not agree more.", "2380 To truly safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the social and economic fabric in remote communities, reforms must benefit everyone. That means consumers, business, and government regardless of the last mile supplier they select.", "2381 A holistic approach would also have to involve commitments by the private sector. Companies like SSi need to take risks and commit to invest in developing the physical infrastructure as well as the human resources, the people to support it.", "2382 I\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019re taking those risks. SSi is in the midst of a massive build-out in Nunavut, the largest in our company\u2019s history. The new infrastructure will be transformative for the north and serve as a showcase for other remote areas around the world. This truly is a Canadian-made and a northern-made exportable model.", "2383 Connectivity is critical. Lack of proper communications infrastructure has real-world negative impacts in our remote communities. ", "2384 When we put this in context. In many remote the communities the school and health centre have a hard time finding and keeping trained staff. Unemployment is very high. Housing is limited and typically overcrowded. Add to this the fact that there are no banks, one or maybe two flights a week in or out, and one sea lift a year to get all of life\u2019s necessities. Imagine that for a moment, if you can -- no TV, no radio, no cellphones, no internet, no libraries, no bookstores, and no ability to leave.", "2385 Broadband removes the barriers created by this isolation. Broadband provides access to books and knowledge. Broadband brings educators and students together. Education enables these same local kids to take on jobs that are currently filled with transient workers from outside the community. In short, connectivity has a dramatic impact on social development. ", "2386 As I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve invested a lot over the past decade; and we\u2019re not finished yet. Last September we announced a $75 million investment program for Nunavut\u2019s broadband future. Continuing over the next three years, it will drive significant network infrastructure and service improvements.", "2387 The Government of Canada contributed 35 million through the Connecting Canadians program to help reduce the cost of consumer broadband in Nunavut. And to be clear, all of the government investment goes directly to satellite capacity, 100 percent of it. ", "2388 SSi is providing all other funding, more than 40 million over the next few years for new infrastructure, even more satellite capacity, facility upgrades, and operating expenses. To be certain, the investments we are making go well beyond what is required of us under the terms of our agreement with the government.", "2389 Consumers saw the first benefits of this on April 1st when we activated new plans and increased usage caps in all 25 communities across Nunavut without increasing consumer pricing.", "2390 Key components of our Nunavut investment program include a 4G broadband wireless network in each of the 25 communities to deliver mobile, voice, and broadband data, as well as other services like home security systems, content streaming, high-definition video conferencing, even plain old home phone service.", "2391 We\u2019re also making significant upgrades to our satellite backbone and gateway infrastructure to support the additional capacity required over the next few years. This is capacity is currently delivered via Telesat using C-band with plans to migrate to a new KA- band high-throughput satellite in 2018.", "2392 Perhaps most importantly, more important than investments in hardware and software, we\u2019re expanding our Service North Program which employs and trains local infrastructure support agents. These training programs are critical to developing long-term employment in the communities. ", "2393 The pictures you are seeing are from the installations going on right now. There\u2019s no question that it is a challenge to build in the north. It\u2019s not a job for the timid and it requires commitment beyond financial return. The current upgrades will dramatically improve the customer experience and deliver critical new services but there\u2019s still more to be done.", "2394 Customer demand in these remote and isolated communities is growing exponentially and backbone capacity is constrained. We\u2019re hopeful that the results from this hearing will create conditions that enable long-term planning and investment. We need to come up with a long-term sustainable strategy.", "2395 While on the topic of capacity, let me touch briefly on the subject of minimum broadband speeds. These targets have been a key area of discussion for some time now. We believe that asking whether the minimum burst speed should be five, 10, or even 25 megabits per second misses the mark. It\u2019s the wrong question and invariably results in customer frustration during moderate to peak network loading. We believe that the overall quality of the service being delivered and the user experience on the ground is what matters.", "2396 The variables that impact those elements include backbone over subscription, wholesale cost which affects the end-user pricing, and reliability. Until these basic service conditions are met, speed is immaterial. This is not to say that minimum burst speed targets should not be set; however, if a user never achieves the advertised speed and their streamed content constantly buffering, then we\u2019ve not really advanced anything.", "2397 It would be like suggesting that people in the Arctic should but Ferraris because they\u2019re three times faster than the half-ton pickup. While we like the idea, it may not be a viable model for the North given our single-lane gravel roads that are covered in ice and snow eight months of the year. Clearly, the CRTC must implement different broadband targets and objectives for the North, particularly satellite-served communities. ", "2398 What matters most to the consumer is that they have access to global content and services with a decent user experience at a price they can afford. That would be something meaningful. As we\u2019ve said before and will continue to repeat, it is reasonably priced access to shared local infrastructure and backbone transport, not the last mile, that are the issues for our remaining underserved communities.", "2399 I\u2019m very proud of SSi\u2019s contributions to the North over the past several decades, both in terms of direct investment but also in terms of downstream benefits like new jobs, new services, and new opportunities made possible through these investments. I\u2019m hopeful that the results of these hearings will enable us to complete the mission we started 25 years ago.", "2400 With that, let me turn it over to Dean to review the details of our evidence and speak to key pieces that we think the Commission must address.", "2401 MR. PROCTOR: Thank you, Jeff, et bonjour.", "2402 SSi\u2019s intervention is entitled \u201cThe Qimirluk\u201d. Qimirluk is the Inuktitut word for backbone, and that is the cornerstone of our proposal to reform the BSO.", "2403 For remote communities to receive better broadband service and participate meaningfully in the digital economy, focus must be on investing in and developing both backbone and gateway infrastructure. Policy reform and new investment mechanisms must also retain and encourage competition and innovation in last-mile service delivered to consumers, business, and government.", "2404 SSi has proposed the creation of a backbone assistance program, what we call the BAP, as a means to augment backbone transport into remote communities and to develop open gateway facilities. This will allow competing local service providers to deliver quality and affordable communication services to end users.", "2405 When we met with you in Whitehorse, we stated to the Commission -- that was back in 2013 -- that it is not at all about subsidies for local access infrastructure. SSi\u2019s current access network available today is capable of delivering five megabits per second download speeds and can be field upgraded to provide more speed and capacity if required. Unfortunately, consumers will not be able to afford greater speeds without increased assistance on the cost of backbone.", "2406 Jeff described to you SSi\u2019s investment program and technologies currently underway in the North. With these, we\u2019re able to meet the Commission\u2019s broadband target speeds of five megabits per second down and one megabit per second up. In fact, we\u2019re capable of delivering many times more that speed to every home, business, and government office in Nunavut. Put this another way, we\u2019re deploying infrastructure in every Nunavut community that can deliver the same quality of broadband as you find in downtown Toronto. ", "2407 Quality local access networks can now be built in remote areas largely due to advances in technology, in particular wireless and IP technologies. Unfortunately, while last-mile infrastructure in remote communities can match that in Southern Canada, the barrier is and remains the backbone transport connecting those same remote communities to the rest of the world.", "2408 Broadband service offering higher speeds and greater capacity in the North is still not affordable for many consumers and business and the government remains starved for capacity to deliver their most basic of electronic services. This reality effectively disenfranchises Northerners from the digital democracy. This is why all roads for policy reform lead to a focus on the backbone.", "2409 In terms of implementation, the exact amount of BAP funding will have to be established based on the service obligations to be met and the number and identity of communities to be served. Service providers that receive BAP funding, the open gateway providers, will be competitively selected. A BAP-funded gateway provider will have to make available and consume the same backbone connectivity and colocation services on the same terms as other local service providers in any given community -- the principle of non-discrimination and no undo preference.", "2410 The selected open gateway provider will acquire satellite or other backbone transport from network operators. They will light this capacity through the use of ground infrastructure, earth stations, and other needed equipment and electronics; bring this capacity into a point of presence in each community; and make backbone connectivity services and colocation facilities available to all local service providers.", "2411 SSi also proposes that any open gateway provider, the party receiving BAP funding, be considered the carrier of last resort for the communities it serves.", "2412 Finally, a key item is how to fund any new mechanism. We\u2019ve detailed in our evidence how the Commission can evolve the existing primary exchange service proven planned subsidy regime to direct -- re-direct funds, rather to the BAP. This will go a long way to addressing the funding needs. ", "2413 In closing, today, consumers and businesses in the north are not full participants in the digital economy and governments in the north cannot offer many essential services that rely on broadband, services that are taken for granted elsewhere. ", "2414 Commission policy of reform must address shortcomings in the delivery of basic telecommunication service to remote areas, including the north. SSi is proposing the Backbone Assistance Program as the principal mechanism to do so. ", "2415 Those living in remote and outlying communities and the businesses, governments, and other organizations that serve these communities must have access to affordable communication services and competitive choice. ", "2416 Quality broadband must become a key component of the basic service objective. The Commission has the means and the Commission has the ability to enact substantial reform. Doing so successfully will allow Canada to be a global showcase, where broadband overcomes the barriers of distance and where all regions of the country, no matter how remote, benefit from and participate fully in the digital economy. ", "2417 Alors avec \u00e7a merci pour l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter devant vous aujourd\u2019hui. Johanne, Chris, Jeff, moi-m\u00eame, on sera tr\u00e8s content de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 vos questions.", "2418 And thank you again. ", "2419 THE CHAIRPERSON: Merci beaucoup. ", "2420 Commissioner MacDonald will start us off, thanks.", "2421 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good morning, and thank you very much for being here today as a service provider in the north. Your voice and your viewpoint and wisdom is very important for this proceeding. ", "2422 I'd like to start off by just discussing some of the speed targets that you put forward in your proposal. I note that you've increased your allowable data caps at no additional cost to your consumers, and are placing more of a focus on quality over increased speeds. And I'm just wondering, we're hearing a lot from other intervenors in this process that the speeds should be increased, and increased significantly in some cases. ", "2423 So can you speak to what type of uses residential or small business customers are able to receive via the current speeds that you're offering today? ", "2424 MR. PHILIPP: Current speeds offered today, so it used to be one and a half mg down, 384 up. That was the old Industry Canada, the last Industry Canada target. ", "2425 And to put this in perspective, we deliver services for more than just residential or household consumers under the contract with connecting Canadians or the previous one. We also deliver for the Government of Nunavut and we deliver for private enterprise and Inuit organizations, those that are not funded or subsidized or a part of the contribution program. ", "2426 And I make that point because when we talk about the speeds available, one and a half mg down, 384 k up, that's not the only speed available. That is the speed that is available to the masses because it's a subsidized rate funded through, in part, the Industry Canada funding that's come about. ", "2427 So the last program was one and a half down, 384 up. The current program is three megabit down, a half Mg up. And the big difference there is, so what can we do with it? Three megabit, frankly, is enough to do anything. Netflix is one megabit, one point one. Surfing the web really is not -- it's not a matter of speed. YouTube videos are typically not high def that you're watching. ", "2428 So speed is a bit of a red herring. It's why I said, you know, I think things like oversubscription are more important. It's wonderful that we can go 220 on the Autobahn in Europe, but it would not be wonderful if there were 5 times as many cars on the Autobahn. You just couldn't get that speed. ", "2429 So speeds are a bit of a red herring if we don\u2019t also address congestion. And congestion is really a matter of oversubscription. ", "2430 So what are they able to do? I think as many other people want to put it very well earlier this morning, usage caps are a major problem. When somebody has to worry about whether or not they should watch this Netflix episode tonight or download that movie tomorrow because they may not be able to finish their homework, that's not a basic service. That's not a viable service, long term. I'm not happy about that as a service provider delivering it. ", "2431 But we don\u2019t make the rules. We respond to an (inaudible) that says, \"This is what is going to be available to consumers in Nunavut, and this is how much money we have. This is the box you will have to work within.\"", "2432 Those are the exact words we're told. And so we try very, very hard to come up with a formula that allows us to deliver a combination of speed and usage caps and oversubscription that means that peak busy hour doesn\u2019t last 14 hours a day. ", "2433 So the challenge is, how do we get enough capacity? Everyone thinks in terms of capacity, megabits per second. And true, if you were to give everyone 25 Megabits per second and you had even a reasonable oversubscription, probably it wouldn't be too bad. ", "2434 But realistically, if we just change our formula and our thinking slightly, instead of it being one connection per home, which is what is subsidized today -- and in fact, we had great debate in this last year, in this last round with Connecting Canadians about who is an eligible subscriber, because when this is the funding -- not this and not this and it's not variable, it's this -- then the only thing we can change if speed can't change and oversubscription can't change is the number of people you can subsidize. ", "2435 So the number of people eligible becomes a problem. It's currently homes and students, not MLAs, not Inuit organizations, not government, not tourists; homes and students. ", "2436 Now, how you police that becomes a whole other problem, and why you have to police that becomes a challenge. And when the funding is that limited, as Oana pointed out this morning, usage caps become a problem, because how much usage can you allow people? You can't rent cars with unlimited gas and unlimited kilometres for a fixed price per month. It just doesn\u2019t work. ", "2437 So what do we need to do? We need to quit thinking in terms of 25 megabit or 10 megabit because those calculations end up leading statisticians and finance people to very, very large numbers for how much the backbone would cost. ", "2438 And what we need to start thinking about is how do we build this better? How do we take what we've got right now, the needs of the people, the infrastructure that exists, the remoteness, and the reality of where we live, and how do we build something sustainable, long-term, that people can afford that works? ", "2439 And it's actually not that complicated. It really isn't that complicated. The answer comes from doing a bunch of things differently. We can't plan in four-year cycles any more. We can't plan in small beauty contests that are run every four years to determine who's got the best proposal, who's willing to commit the most, and frankly, it's typically commit the most marketing, 75 megabit, oh, it's LTE. But you won\u2019t get 75 megabit on the backbone.", "2440 If you look into the details, what you'll find is that Industry Canada for years has said -- and don\u2019t get me wrong, Industry Canada have been there to deliver funding and we've been there to co-invest with them, so I'm not hanging Industry Canada out to dry. Frankly, without them, we wouldn't have anything in the north today. We'd still be talking about dialup. ", "2441 But because of their programs, we have been able to build something. It's an LTE network in every community. It's amazing. The reality is the backbone out of those communities is too tight. ", "2442 Now, we're also, fortunately, the provider to the Government of Nunavut. In 2009 we won that contract. It was something that NorthwesTel had had for decades and we won it, in part, because if we were to combine those revenue streams from both operations from what we were doing with broadband and what we were doing with the Government of Nunavut, we could make our little network work. We could make this service delivery of broadband into these communities viable and sustainable with the pittance that is available, frankly, to deliver it. ", "2443 Now, what we need to do today is, we need to look at, how do we combine the need of government and the need of residential users and education and mining, into one pipe, not separate roads? ", "2444 We've built a separate road for the government into every one of these communities and a separate road for the private sector into these communities and they do not share capacity. ", "2445 It's like looking across a divider at the government's 80 megabit all night long while it sits there not fully utilized and all day long those same employees in the government have come from home to work in the government offices and the broadband that is sitting on the other side of the road, the Autobahn, with 800 megabit, is sitting there really half-used. ", "2446 Now, this is not a common argument made by a service provider selling to both clients, but it's the only argument that makes sense. We could continue to sell to the Government of Nunavut, and I think competitively do that and win that at public tender. ", "2447 We could continue to bid on Industry Canada projects where there isn't enough funding to meet the basic service objectives we set for ourselves, but if we could combine those two sources of revenue and those two networks, those two amounts of capacity, which is constrained -- we've heard that from everyone, it's satellite, and I'm not here to argue about satellite. I think there's great solutions with satellite, but we have a constrained resource. If we were to use it better we could get a lot more from it, and it wouldn't cost the consumer any more. It wouldn't cost the government any more. It's simply allowing the sharing of capacity. ", "2448 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So you're point about sharing capacity is definitely a valid one, but we're also hearing in this hearing the size of the households in the north, relative to households in the south, and there are more users. Do you see that daytime traffic dropping off that significantly during the daytime hours on the residential side given the sheer sixe of the families occupying those dwellings?", "2449 MR. PHILIPP: I think it depends how we measure. If we measure as the number of homes connected, we can show very high penetration. I know that Oana had some statistics earlier, which is an average I\u2019m assuming, of all service providers because our penetrations are certainly higher in the communities that we\u2019re in and we\u2019re in every community. So as far as number of homes and residences we have a very high number. ", "2450 But when we use that as a metric to determine the number of subscribers, we\u2019re missing, to your point, the fact that there are six or eight people in that home. And we\u2019re already starting with constrained networks. ", "2451 So what we need to do is change the method that we use to evaluate capacity. If we went to a per-subscriber basis, we said, \u201cWhat do we need on a per-subscriber basis?\u201d Forget how many are in a home. Let\u2019s say 2 megabit because really, if you can stream a Netflix video at 1 megabit and you could also surf a little bit of web and I\u2019ve seen my kids do it, they can three devices going -- but if you have 2 megabit and if everybody in your home had 2 megabit and there were six people, you\u2019d now have 12 megabit allocated to you under some funding formula. ", "2452 And if we kept the oversubscription low enough, meaning not 50 to 1, not 50 people sharing 1 megabit, but more like 30 to 1, and reducing to 20 to 1 over the next 5 years, we could make the existing capacity work. We could make the capacity per household significant enough that usage caps wouldn\u2019t be a problem and stuttering internet wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But we don\u2019t need 20 megabit to do it or we need 20 megabit with a low enough oversubscription.", "2453 So your point is valid. There are more people per home. And when we measure broadband capacity on a per-home basis, we get messed up in the north because we\u2019ve got more people than the south and we don\u2019t have as big a pipe.", "2454 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So in your presentation today you were talking about needing to take a longer-term view for any of these projects and the fact that, you know, what you\u2019re installing has the ability to be upgraded over the long-term. And just yesterday we heard from the Government of Yukon; they came in and they were suggesting a target of 25 down, 3 meg up and an aspirational goal of 100 down and 30 up. ", "2455 The equipment that you\u2019re installing, is it capable of delivering bandwidth at or near those levels? Understand that there\u2019s an upgrade course and everything that goes along with that.", "2456 MR. PHILIPP: Sure. What we\u2019re installing right now is LTE. It\u2019s standards-based LTE 4G. So the radios can deliver 150 megabit plus per sector. We have multiple sectors per remote community. So if you take the smallest community in Nunavut, we have 400 megabits of last mile capacity in that community now. But we\u2019re sharing 800 megabit across the entire territory. So it doesn\u2019t really matter that one community had 400 megabit when there\u2019s 25 of them and communities like Iqaluit have gigabits of last mile. Our backbone is what is congested.", "2457 So LTE with upgrades -- and frankly upgrades are licensed (inaudible) and that sort of thing. It\u2019s not even huge capacity or hardware upgrades. The last mile is not the challenge financially or logistically. It\u2019s the fact that for another competitor to come into Grise Fiord or Qikiqtarjuaq or anywhere in Nunavut, they need a piece of land; they need a building; they need a backup generator; they need a colocation facility; they need a tower; and they need shipping and receiving; they need flights and technical people. And that doesn\u2019t exist.", "2458 So our concept of this open backbone to share facilities so that any service provider can deliver in that community is the starting point. Without that we could put in fibre to every community. Where would it land? What building would it terminate in? Is that building connected to the schools and the hospitals and the Government of Nunavut? Does that building have a tower next to it for distribution?", "2459 Somebody brought up the question of SuperNET on the first day. The biggest failure of SuperNET was that they didn\u2019t build out local access infrastructure, meaning there was no place, when I wanted to open up in Red Deer, to mount a tower on the SuperNET facility because I needed to get the connectivity from there, from that fibre node, to my building. Because there was colocation; there was no tower; there was no mast; there was no ability to directional drill under the train track. So we just walked away and said, \u201cWell, forget it. It\u2019s a great node but it\u2019s on the other side of the river and nobody can get to it.\u201d", "2460 So in all of these communities you could bring the best satellite capacity in space, you could bring fibre right up the street. What buildings are going into? They don\u2019t exist today in these communities. We don\u2019t have lots of infrastructure. We don\u2019t have enough housing. We don\u2019t have enough power. We don\u2019t have enough water or sewers. ", "2461 So what building? If that\u2019s the starting point, if we put in an open backbone facility, and if satellite is there today, whether it be C band or in 2018 high throughput, when fibre shows up, and it will and we hope it will, it needs to come to that same facility. ", "2462 Because what\u2019s going to back the fibre up? We all talk about fibre being the end-all, be-all, but what is the backup when that fibre breaks if it isn\u2019t a complete ring? Satellite. What\u2019s the solution over the next decade while we wait for fibre to get there? Satellite. What is it that everybody needs on the ground to be able to support satellite or last mile or competition or fibre? Infrastructure. And you can\u2019t build that one-off per carrier in these communities. So we need more backbone capacity, no question. ", "2463 The amounts that Government of Nunavut or the Yukon Government put forward are great targets; don\u2019t get me wrong. If we had fibre in every community why wouldn\u2019t you? If you had gigabits of capacity why wouldn\u2019t you give that kind of speed? You\u2019re not constrained anymore as Oana put it. Right now there\u2019s so much constraint.", "2464 Let me give you some very simple business case, I believe a very simple business case, and it goes to your question of long-term planning. We plan in four-year cycles right now. We go to Telesat and we negotiate the most capacity we can buy with the amount of money that Industry Canada has and then we hand that entire cheque over to them. And we put up matching funds towards that and then we build the infrastructure on the ground. That\u2019s a four-year planning cycle. We can\u2019t get much buy from them in four years with $35 million.", "2465 But if we were looking long-term at the life of a satellite, 15 years for a high-throughput satellite, and if we look at the cost of that payload, the entire payload, of Ka band at 24 gigabits per second, not hundreds of megabits per transponder, but thousands of megabits per transponder, the payload is not the big experience, right? Getting the thing into space is the big expense. Buying that thing upfront is a big expense. But it\u2019s a trivial expense when amortized over 15 years.", "2466 And so the question of how much capacity do we need per consumer you can come at from the bottom or the top. And the bottom is per subscriber this much with this oversubscription, not per home. That\u2019s that much bandwidth today and Oana pointed out not a plateau for the next five years but let\u2019s keep increasing that.", "2467 So let\u2019s look at the average. If it was 5 megabit today, even 3 today, frankly, with a low enough oversubscription, and if we did it on a per-population basis, not per-household basis, and we aimed at 10, even in 5 years we would have enough satellite capacity in space with the first high throughput, 24,000 megabits, 12 down and 12 up.", "2468 So from the bottom we work our math up, and we\u2019re going to find that if you gave everyone 10 megabit per second -- or actually 25 megabit per second was a quick calculation they did yesterday -- and you took 10,000 subscribers and you went at 20 to 5 to 1 oversubscription, which would be a great number for us in the north today, you need 10 gigabit. That\u2019s a single high-throughput satellite. That\u2019s one.", "2469 And we don\u2019t need just one because we need redundancy and diversity. We can\u2019t just have one. So we really need to plan for two. And those two need to come down into a common piece of infrastructure with two dishes, one pointing at each one, with redundant transmit power, with backup power, with secure and non-secure colocation facilities, and with a tower. And once that\u2019s built, that\u2019s a couple $100 million to buy those payloads, then we\u2019ve got capacity for 15 years. ", "2470 And at that point we can look top-down. How much do we have? How many subscribers do we have? What should we set our basic service at? Well, we could increase the basic service. And as fibre comes in we could redirect that capacity to other communities that don\u2019t have as much and that will not get fibre.", "2471 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So we know that the satellites have, you know, constraints on capacity and cost. So I\u2019m wondering, how do you actually build your internet packages today. How do you decide, based on those constraints, you know, what the data allowance should be? What\u2019s your thought process when you\u2019re doing that?", "2472 MR. PHILIPP: I spent many long, dark days in a room before bidding this last Industry Canada. I\u2019m not kidding. I spent three days in a very dark, depressive state because frankly there was no good way to make this business case work. You know, somebody I\u2019m sure is going to ask me -- Mr. Menzies is going to ask me -- why we would invest $40 million alongside a $35 million federal investment? Well, if we didn\u2019t who would? If we didn\u2019t step up and take a risk, if we didn\u2019t build this LTE infrastructure, the MCS infrastructure wasn\u2019t going to do it. It wasn\u2019t going to last long enough. It was a dead investment; why put more money into it?", "2473 So the answer is the business case in the north is possible if you aggregate, if you don\u2019t treat every opportunity as a separate one, if you build a backbone that brings the wholesale cost down for all carriers. And Dean made mention of this, where we eat and buy the same thing we sell, right? If that were a possibility, if an open competition would allow the lowest-cost price to deliver an open backbone into every one of these communities, I don\u2019t care if we win it or NorthwesTel or Bell or Rogers wins it, I care that it\u2019s there. Because if the wholesale price delivered to the community is low enough because the backbone is purchased over a long period of time -- and not just the capacity in space. The training of people on the ground -- without local residents trained to maintain and support the infrastructure. ", "2474 And I am a local resident from a community of 800 people, a small Aboriginal community in the Northwest Territories. I\u2019ve lived there over half my life. I only moved to the capital 16 years ago. I\u2019m telling you, this is possible. ", "2475 The Northerners have the technical capability to maintain and manage and support the network, but we need to train them. And training typically doesn\u2019t flow unless you\u2019ve got a grade 10 Math and English. And frankly, that\u2019s not the priority in these communities.", "2476 So we need to build an open backbone. We need to look at a long-term plan for buying capacity. We need to look at training people on the ground. And ultimately to meet the objective of the CRTC and everyone else, all competitors, we need to open that backbone up and allow competition, allow everyone to compete. And if nobody shows up in Grise Fiord to compete, make the person with the open backbone deliver the service, in Grise Fiord. ", "2477 This is not that difficult and the money we are talking about, if we aggregated with Northwest Tel who\u2019s doing voice right now, we have a significant subsidy for terrestrial copper. We\u2019re going to deploy mobile voice in every one of these communities this year. I assure you that very few people will be buying copper by Christmas, because the mobile voice package will be more competitive and bundled with your home internet service, and ideally a TV service, which we should be multi-casting to all of these communities as well, and radio.", "2478 We should be doing this in every one of these communities, but we need to do it in one long-term sustainable plan that looks at fibre as well. I\u2019m not against fibre. I love fibre. Everyone -- and we get a hard time on Facebook and from our customers because we don\u2019t deliver enough usage, we don\u2019t deliver enough speed, and we\u2019re against fibre.", "2479 That\u2019s not the case. We\u2019ve invested so much of our personal money into building this network because I believe every one of these communities needs this.", "2480 It\u2019s not a matter of the basic service objective for me. It\u2019s a matter of what is healthcare and education going to cost us if we don\u2019t start improving the connectivity into these communities?", "2481 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So on the topic of funding, you\u2019ve received significant funding over the years from, you know, what was Industry Canada. ", "2482 And I noted the slide 15 of your presentation where you\u2019re showing some of your different, different offerings and the price points. And I found them on your Website as well. And I noted that there are significantly different prices for residents of Nunavut and then non-residents as well for what appear to be the same packages. And the prices don\u2019t double but, in some cases, are close to doubling.", "2483 So I\u2019m wondering if you could explain what the rationale is for charging residents a different fee than non-residents or perhaps that\u2019s something tied to your funding requirements that are provided and stipulated by Industry Canada.", "2484 MR. PHILIPP: It\u2019s a great question.", "2485 When we bid this last round, this project, public tender, certain amount of money available, we spent six months prior to the close of this trying to have Industry Canada understand that 5 Megabits down, 1 Megabit up was not winning customers. That was a number of the speedometer.", "2486 They came back and agreed, 3 Megs down and a half Meg up, because we could lower the over-subscription; don\u2019t over-promise, over-deliver.", "2487 So they agreed to that but they said, this is how much money we have. I said, well, this is how many subscribers we have. So subscribers, times this speed at this oversubscription, times time, there\u2019s how much capacity we need.", "2488 There\u2019s the price of capacity, that\u2019s not possible. So what do we do at that point?", "2489 Industry Canada says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s the box you have to work within. That\u2019s how much money is available for Nunavut.\u201d", "2490 Okay, so how do we reduce that? We can\u2019t reduce the speed below 3 Megabits. I\u2019m not willing to accept a contract with a high oversubscription because then it\u2019s just me lying to the consumer. There\u2019s no more money available. ", "2491 At that point, you have to reduce subscribers, eligible subscribers -- who\u2019s eligible to receive the funding?", "2492 Well, this is for residents in Nunavut. Okay, so what\u2019s a resident in Nunavut? It\u2019s a house. And because of the work that Arctic College had done and many people want to include it, Nunavut Broadband include it, to try to make education a really high priority in Nunavut, students were accepted into this criteria as well.", "2493 So homes and students are the eligible recipients of the Industry Canada funding in this last round. And I may as well say it here first, every MNA in Nunavut who has a personal account on QINIQ will now have to pay the non-resident fee because they\u2019re no longer subsidized. They\u2019re not part of the criteria but they all have a modem because they all travel and they need it.", "2494 Government doesn\u2019t get a subsidy. They pay more for the capacity.", "2495 So right now, the funding -- you start with funding, you take out what the service is, you divide it by the service level and you determine how many subscribers you can manage.", "2496 And the reality is that\u2019s really a backwards way to do it. But it\u2019s the only way to do it if you have a limited amount of funding and you\u2019re not looking at this thing holistically. You\u2019re just looking at this is how much money we, Industry Canada, have and there\u2019s the problem we need to resolve. The broadband has to carry on.", "2497 How would anybody have come to Nunavut this last go-around and bid to build land -- to buy land, put piles in, put buildings in, put towers in, multiple co-location sites around the larger communities, and take the money from the feds and give it all for satellite capacity? All the rest, they\u2019d have to pay for themselves and recover in a four-year window.", "2498 The reason that we are winning these over and over is because we\u2019re the only people foolish enough to put up the matching funds and to continue to invest in the North.", "2499 And I mean that seriously. I mean, it\u2019s funny frankly. I have a hard time with it too every time we go into this. Which is why I spent three days in a deep, dark hole wondering how we were going to make this work this last time.", "2500 And what I said to Industry Canada and I said to my team was, \u201cWhat choice do we have? If we don\u2019t do this, who\u2019s going to do it? Who is going to be there April 1st, in 12 months, right?\u201d", "2501 This was awarded January, a year ago. So in 14 months, somebody would have to build this and operate it.", "2502 So we invested a significant amount of our own money in this last round because we know there has to be a solution. It has to be a longer term solution.", "2503 So we are taking the risk on the ground to build the infrastructure for the long-term.", "2504 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Xplornet Communications can provide services coast-to-coast-to-coast, and I\u2019m looking at some of their pricing in comparison to some of your pricing. And I\u2019m just wondering why yours may tend, in some cases, to be more expensive than they\u2019re offering, especially in light of the funding that you\u2019ve received?", "2505 MR. PHILIPP: I\u2019d go further and say their pricing is incredibly attractive, and I\u2019d say their penetration probably sucks because if you\u2019re not in the community, if you\u2019re not there to build the antenna on the roof and fix it after the blizzard and answer the questions of the customer; if your peak busy hour in the Nunavut territories -- because if you actually read all of the terms of service that Xplornet have on their Website, they\u2019ve got six or seven platforms. The two that cover the North have drastically different terms of service than the ones in the South.", "2506 Their peak busy hour runs from 1:00 a.m. until 7:00 a.m., I believe. There\u2019s not a lot of time in there to do anything else. That means they\u2019re congested for a long period of time. It means that the usage that you could give away at $2 a Gig doesn\u2019t really matter because not as many people are going to receive it.", "2507 So I don\u2019t know how Xplornet is able to do that in the South. I haven\u2019t heard them say numerous times they don\u2019t get any funding. I\u2019ve seen recently, in the last week, press announcements of $6 million or to that effect going towards Barrett Xplornet for delivering internet into remote areas. ", "2508 So, you know, I don\u2019t have any objections to Barrett, to Northwest Tel, to anybody delivering services in the north. I wish they all would. I wish everybody went into every community, not just cherry-pick the biggest ones; not just the Rankin, Iqaluit, Cambridges that Northwest Tel prefers to deliver service in, and frankly at rates that make no sense to me. ", "2509 But if you were to deliver service into every community in Nunavut, into the 16 smallest communities in Nunavut, you would realize that Barrett Xplornet is not anywhere to be found.", "2510 There\u2019s some that are using it, but the reality is if you wait months and have to sign a long-term contract and put up a lot of money, and it\u2019s reliant on a technician that doesn\u2019t live locally, that\u2019s not viable.", "2511 In our case, from day one, in 2004, we built a model that was a community aggregated model, where we would try to aggregate as much of the local services as we could through a gateway, because it was the only way to make that efficient.", "2512 We would build infrastructure with a long-term view, which is what we\u2019ve done in our family business for 50 years. And we would put a model together, which used community service providers where we gave initially, in 2004, 20 percent of the revenue -- not the margin, not the profit at the end of the year -- the revenue on every account went to a local agent. ", "2513 We still deliver over 10 percent of our revenue to the local agent and we\u2019ve taken technical support back out of the mix because if we roll out 4G LTE and mobile phones, we need a higher level of support for our voice service than what we can rely on with an agent who is getting a fee or a portion of the revenue.", "2514 Now, we put over $1 million a year into the Nunavut economy in the communities by taking a portion of our revenue and giving it back to the agent.", "2515 The Service North program I talked about in the presentation is extremely important to me. It is training local people in the communities how to manage the infrastructure. We spend $10,000 per technician to send them to a community to climb a tower. Any community in Nunavut that\u2019s the average. You don\u2019t send one; you send two because you need a safety guy on the ground and a guy on the tower. That\u2019s $10,000 per person per year. There\u2019s at least four providers between Nav Canada, CBC, RCMP, SSi, and NorthwesTel. Why wouldn\u2019t we have a local resident who\u2019s been tower-safety trained who can hold the rope at the bottom of the tower and ensure that we don\u2019t have any accidents, or rescue our people on the tower, and have $40,000 a year worth of income available to them just by what I would be spending and the others would anyways.", "2516 So Service North is critical to delivery of these things. It\u2019s not an add-on.", "2517 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So based on your statements, and this is probably a yes or no question, you would ---", "2518 MR. PHILIPP: Really?", "2519 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You would be of the viewpoint that even with Xplornet\u2019s future offer, and they\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to be able to deliver 25 megs everywhere in Canada, that that is not going to meet the unique needs of your service territory?", "2520 MR. PHILIPP: No. That\u2019s a no. That\u2019s an absolute unequivocal no.", "2521 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "2522 So significant money had already been invested both from government and from yourselves and other service providers to improve connectivity and improve services in the north. And I note that in your proposal you\u2019ve suggested the open gateway facility and the Backbone Assistance Program. How can that existing investment that has already taken place be leveraged? Or if we move in the direction of, say, the Backbone Assistance Program, does past investment all become for naught and it\u2019s replaced? Or can it be leveraged with new investment?", "2523 MR. PHILIPP: That\u2019s a good question.", "2524 You know, right now in the Northwest Territories and in Nunavut and in the Yukon, if you look there are really two providers. There\u2019s NorthwesTel with infrastructure -- and there\u2019s more providers than that, but if you look at who has infrastructure of any significance it\u2019s really NorthwesTel and SSi.", "2525 I would say that in all three territories the infrastructure that exists today is not the infrastructure we need tomorrow. That goes even for our infrastructure.", "2526 Now, to put this in more perspective, in Nunavut we have invested a lot over the last 10 years and our infrastructure in those communities is significant and is being designed and has been designed for the last decade to support these ideas, this open backbone that we talked about, this open colocation facility. So in the nine largest communities we have invested in infrastructure that would support the model that we\u2019re talking about.", "2527 But the bigger challenge is the 16 smallest communities. Now, we\u2019ve deployed our LTE there. It\u2019s sitting on the colocation facility that we have now. But it\u2019s not big enough to support Nav Canada, RCMP, CBC, NorthwesTel, Bell, Rogers Wireless. And something needs to be built to support all of them.", "2528 So in my view, if this were a public tender or a public RFP that we were bidding on, we would take all of the assets, as we\u2019ve always done, and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s already spent. Now what do we need to complete the project?\u201d NorthwesTel would do the same thing. ", "2529 Anybody new coming to the game, anybody from the south that wants to bid on this, they\u2019d have to start over. But frankly, the amount in the grand scheme of things that would have to be replaced is not going to be what puts them at a disadvantage. What puts the southerners at a disadvantage for building this network is the knowledge, the desire, the willingness to invest, the willingness to take risk. And if you haven\u2019t been born and raised in a small community in the north, if you haven\u2019t lived that life, you probably aren\u2019t willing to. There\u2019s suburb outside of Toronto that will generate far more revenue than all of the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the Yukon.", "2530 But if we believe long-term that we need people in the north that we as Canada want to claim the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, the Northwest Passage, the oil and gas and the resources there as ours, we need people in the north; we need people in these communities. And if we want people in these communities, we need to provide the services.", "2531 So there\u2019s a large amount of investment that needs to be made. But frankly, the bigger investment it will depend on who you are. Everyone will build it slightly differently. If I was building it my way it would be redundant. There would be two satellites in space, high throughput. There would be a facility with private, secure, and non-secure colocation. There would be a tower with other distribution sites around town. There would be a backup generator. And you would provide fibre to the main facilities and classrooms and schools. That\u2019s the way we would build it.", "2532 But if the specs came out and said, \u201cThis is the box; what can you build?\u201d Then everyone is going to have a different view.", "2533 My view is it doesn\u2019t need to be a huge capital expense that the federal government bears. This needs to be a long-term contractual commitment to use the services. ", "2534 There\u2019s lots of money out there. Private equity has money to build infrastructure; the business case as I know it makes sense. Maybe it doesn\u2019t make sense for all the big carriers, but it makes sense for us. It makes sense that if we aggregate the mobile, voice, and data, the residential voice, the government business, and what we as Canada need to deliver for basic services, there is enough money to build and operate this network without having to have huge billion-dollar investments. ", "2535 And when fibre comes it won\u2019t come overnight. It will come gradually and organically over the next 20 years as we have more of these meetings. But at least the basic facilities will be there. At least the backup and redundancy for that fibre with exist. And at least we won\u2019t wait another five years to deliver basic services to these regions.", "2536 And one last point on this. This is not just a model for the North. If you think about the high-throughput satellites being launched and the coverage that could be built if we were designing a payload, we wouldn\u2019t just target the North, Nunavut\u2019s 25 communities. You would target the mid-north; you would target all of northern Alberta, BC, and Ontario and all of those communities that currently don\u2019t have infrastructure or services or backbone.", "2537 And you\u2019d use the same model. You\u2019d put out a public competition and say, \u201cWho wants to build an open backbone in all of these communities\u201d and utilize that asset in space fully. Not to the point where we\u2019re going to Telesat and saying, \u201cWell, this is how much we can afford.\u201d No, we own the whole thing, 24 gigabit on two satellites. ", "2538 And all of a sudden we can service 150 reserves and Aboriginal communities across Canada that currently have no connectivity, and with one open facility, deliver an LTE last mile, which solves the distance education problem. ", "2539 It doesn\u2019t solve the problems; it provides the tools and the facilities to deliver the solutions into all of these communities very quickly without waiting for the next big, shiny thing, meaning fibre from point to point to point. That\u2019s great, but short of somebody paying a lot of money I don\u2019t see it happening in my lifetime.", "2540 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So with respect to your open-gateway infrastructure proposal, and this might be a little bit of dangerous question because when you\u2019re building something it can be cheap, it can be fast, or it can be good, but you can only pick two of those things -- how long would it take?", "2541 MR. PHILIPP: In five years we would be done. We would be done with all of these disconnected communities across Canada. The Aboriginal reserves and the small communities would be complete.", "2542 And the reason I say that is we\u2019re not building them one-off. You\u2019re designing a facility, our open gateway, somebody else\u2019s, with certain specs, certain requirements -- it has to be able to deliver x, y, and z, tilt up mast for cellular, dish on the roof, two dishes. You can cookie-cutter those. ", "2543 This is model where -- it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been planning my whole life. Twenty (20) years ago I saw a documentary on Holiday Inn and the answer was, \u201cHow did you go from 1 to 20 to 500 in a year?\u201d ", "2544 And the guy that started it said, \u201cWell, you know, once you figure out what people want and you figure out the price plan and you start to optimize it, then it\u2019s just cookie-cutter. Then it\u2019s build them as quick as you can.\u201d ", "2545 I\u2019m talking about 2 40-foot C cans a third one for power, for redundant power. Those C cans we build them now and they take weeks. If we were to ramp that up it would be days to build one of those. And they would be factory-assembled and shipped to site. Whether it be a fibre site or a satellite site is really immaterial. ", "2546 So building the infrastructure and deploying it across the country if it\u2019s cookie-cutter is simple. If we\u2019re building two satellites, one is going up in 2018; that\u2019s Telesat\u2019s new Ka high throughput. We will be one of the first people on it. Our contract, in fact, with Telesat that we just signed ensures that we will be one of the first people one it. Next year we\u2019ll start building high-throughput gateways in some of our communities to be able to move traffic off C band onto Ka high throughput.", "2547 And if we were to look at this as a national initiative, a priority to improve the basic service objective and remove these barriers, these isolations in all of these communities, two high-throughput satellites properly designed with an R footprint covering the mid-north and the north, the first one is being launched in a year, a year and a half and be operational. The next one isn\u2019t even planned. ", "2548 And the first one is not being planned with this in mind. I\u2019ve been harassing, I would say, Telesat to ensure that the beam coverage makes sense, to ensure that -- you know, even things like why don\u2019t we have one of those beams -- which is not fixed -- one of those beams which could provide spot coverage to any fibre break across the country, within the footprint obviously? It\u2019s an extra amount of money that you have to build into the platform. There\u2019s only a certain amount of deck space on the aircraft; there\u2019s only a certain amount of antennas you can put there.", "2549 But with a proper plan, five years. And with the opportunities that are there and the existing revenues and money being spent, this does not have to be a huge undertaking that is not sustainable. In fact, I would not be a part of it if it was. It doesn\u2019t interest me to build something that was not sustainable.", "2550 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that.", "2551 I believe in your proposal you suggested an initial contract term of 25 years and I'm wondering, understanding a lot of the money goes towards buying payload on satellites when those contracts expire, what happens to the rest of the infrastructure at the end of the 25 years, the open gateway facilities you'd be looking to build? Are they end of life and essentially valueless at that stem point or would ownership need to be transferred in any way to a future provider after the initial contract term?", "2552 MR. PHILIPP: There's many existing examples of how this could be structured. One is in power right now. You know, right now in the Northwest Territories, in my hometown, the power provider is actually Northland Utilities, an ATCO Company. We bought those assets when they won that contract, that franchise. They bid on winning the franchise.", "2553 The network was already built. The power infrastructure was built. They just came over and put in a better bid later on to take over the operation because they thought they could do it cheaper or better.", "2554 Now, in terms of length of time and whether that asset is worth anything, the best example I could point to is the Snowshoe Inn. That's what SSi stands for. It\u2019s the family business and 50 years ago, my father built a motel, a restaurant, a construction company in a little town of 700 people when there was no need for a motel. There was a need for some accommodations for people that were doing DEW Line work or who were mapping out the north.", "2555 That motel today, 50 years later, with 35 little rooms in that community is an asset that would be hardly replaced with less than $5 million investment, meaning at about $400 a square foot, you could build in these communities.", "2556 So when we build infrastructure, if we build it right, if we build a throw-away trinket, a four-year solution, it will be \u201cdual 40-foot C camps\u201d (phonetic) for private or secure and non-secure co-location. It will be a backup power plant that normally provides power for this facility. But frankly, if we're going to do this, if you look at Nunavut and the need in power, we're going to put more power in.", "2557 So the infrastructure needs to be designed right and there's no reason why these buildings and these facilities won't last 25, 30, 40, 50 years. That isn't the challenge if we build it right.", "2558 And frankly, if we're going to do this, it only makes sense to build it right because when fiber does show up or when some new technology -- take OneWeb, great topic of discussion. We've met with OneWeb and frankly, I'm happy to see OneWeb and every other opportunity that comes along that provides capacity. But the reality is those are not going to be the backbone into these communities. Those are not going to be the thing that solves our problem.", "2559 OneWeb provides great service on the land. OneWeb will provide the opportunity that when we're doing search and rescues outside of these communities, over this two million square kilometre area, we will have connectivity in a portable fashion. But OneWeb is not the backbone gateway that people think. It's not going to provide gigabits to a single community and when we're talking about 150 megabits per sector on our LTE network and 20 sectors deployed in a place like Cambridge Bay, you're not going to feed that with OneWeb. The pricing for that type of solution is too high. But OneWeb is one solution. It's one more piece of the puzzle but what we need initially is working from the bottom up.", "2560 The core infrastructure and the training on the ground, we need the stuff on the ground, the building, the house, the thing we go into. We need to train the people on how to support it. We need to get the existing services into it. We need to open it up so that new competitors can come in without spending millions of dollars per community to get their foot in the door.", "2561 I'll stop with that. That was a \u201cyes\u201d.", "2562 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you. Thank you for that.", "2563 Changing focus here for just a minute, a latest communications monitoring report indicated that cost of services were increasing at a higher rate than inflation and that's particularly the case with entry level services.", "2564 So I'm just wondering if you can speak to the affordability of service in your service area and what SSi in particular does to ensure that your services are affordable for residents?", "2565 MR. PHILIPP: They're not affordable. It's that simple. Frankly, $80 a month is not affordable in my mind in the north, certainly not in the Arctic where unemployment is as high as it is.", "2566 If you go back to my presentation when I say can you envision, you know, no TV, no radios, no cell phone, I mean this is a reality. Yes, we've got TV. We've got a couple of channels over maybe the local co-op cable network but we don\u2019t have direct home TV in all these communities. We don\u2019t have a lot of these services.", "2567 So is $80 a month for internet with 20 gigs a month and 3 megs down and a higher subscription affordable, not at all.", "2568 People afford it but, frankly, we went to no contract, month to month, pay as you go because people couldn't afford it. And when you put them into a two-year contract at $80 a month and they don\u2019t make a payment and you suspend their account for two weeks, and when they finally do make a payment because their pay cycle when they get their cheque for their work doesn\u2019t happen to coincide with your billing cycle, that's a reality in the north. They're living paycheque to paycheque.", "2569 I mean food scarcity is a reality, right. Finding enough food for your family is a reality. So is 80 bucks affordable, not a chance. Is it being bought by thousands of subscribers, absolutely, but should we be doing more, no question. Do we have the funding to do more? I'll repeat, this is the box. So no, it's not affordable.", "2570 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So with respect to funding, the Affordable Access Coalition has suggested that a fund be created to offset the monthly recurring charges for low-income Canadians. That's one option.", "2571 Another option would be for the Commission to institute an entry level service package at a regulated rate and ensure that it's affordable that way.", "2572 Would you care to speak to which direction you would feel is the best approach?", "2573 MR. PHILIPP: Yeah, I thought about this a lot. I think that if we try to mandate a price that is affordable, it becomes a very, very big job. Somebody has got to monitor, police what's affordable. Is that speed still right? Is 5 megabits the right thing for the basic service?", "2574 What we need to do is make the wholesale price affordable so that carriers can offer services competitively and I agree that we're not going to find market forces in every community. But if we start with a very simple premise that in all of these markets we need the wholesale price to the service provider to be cost effective so that we don't need to provide a subsidy at the retail level, we need to make sure that the price per megabit delivered in Grise Fiord is the same as the price per megabit delivered via fiber to our teleport in Kanata, and if we could do that, if we could achieve that, we would find service providers, guys like me, in a little town of 700 people 25 years ago saying, \u201cHey, I can buy that gateway feed and I can deliver dial-up internet in my hometown\u201d, which we did 25 years ago. We bought one of the first 56K frame relay or CSU/DSU at the time was a sync link for Northwestel and put in a modem pool.", "2575 There's people in the communities that will deliver. What you heard from the First Mile connection network was, you know, we provide a backbone and we allow the community to take over and do the rest. Well, frankly, that's a little too much. Most of those communities won\u2019t find enough people to do it.", "2576 So the answer is two-fold. You need to provide a contribution to reduce the cost of backbone connectivity and co-location facilities. So it can\u2019t just be the super net model of fiber to that point and now you figure out the rest, especially not in the Arctic in these small communities, in any of these remote communities.", "2577 It needs to go further. The line in the sand needs to be at the \u201cyou can now deliver a service\u201d. You put your server in that rack, you put your cable up that tower. It's already there because we've already run the cables and the antennas because we've got the installers. And you now buy capacity at a regulated rate on this backbone. Now you will have competition at the edge.", "2578 And where there isn\u2019t competition because we spent a lot of time thinking about this, about how do we get around all the objections that might come to this plan from other competitors, from government, from others, government needs a co-location facility. We need one. Northwestel needs one. Nobody is going to object to that. Somebody might object to who owns it. Make that up. Make that a competition. Make that a public tender. Let the most creative people design, build, and operate it.", "2579 Once that happens, if you don\u2019t have service in a community, what we've proposed in the past is run a reverse auction because, frankly, if you just say, \u201cWell, it should be $50 a month and you need to deliver it there\u201d, if there's 20 customers in that community and you're going to generate $1,000 a month worth of revenue, how good is the service you're going to deliver?", "2580 So the reality is we need to also look at the second level which is if there is no service delivered in that community, then what do you do to encourage service providers to come in?", "2581 Our view in the past has been run a reverse auction in the community. Say, \u201cThis is what we want. This is what the consumer needs. Here's the wholesale price. It's already set. You should be able to do it.\u201d", "2582 Now, run that reverse auction and whoever wins that, force them to deliver it but don\u2019t exclude others and I'm talking against myself here frankly. I believe you should leave the market open and if somebody else comes to the market and there is a subsidy already set because of the reverse auction and a second competitor comes in and they win the customer, give them the subsidy.", "2583 Don\u2019t continue to provide a subsidy to an incumbent or a service provider like us if we are not delivering the service. It makes no sense.", "2584 So it\u2019s two level. It\u2019s the backbone; we have to provide the infrastructure and provide a regulated price in, that is at wholesale and competitive with what we can buy in the south or slightly higher. But really, if we could buy it what we\u2019re buying it in the south, then all of a sudden the problem simply comes down to, why isn\u2019t there a service provider locally? And frankly, if that gateway were there and if that backbone were cheap enough, there are people in these communities; there are ISPs and service providers that will start up.", "2585 In fact, if you go back and look at why Articom was founded in the Northwest Territories, it used to be that the Government in the Northwest Territories bought their services in each community individually. And then one of the carriers, NorthwesTel, proposed, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t we build a backbone into every community? And if we do that, the price for all the service providers will become cheaper and all of a sudden the problems will be solved.\u201d ", "2586 It was a great idea; it just never got completed. They started building a backbone that went to frame relay but the promises of the prices decreasing never happened, never materialized. The open access to colocation never materialized. The towers that we might be able to use never materialized because if you can keep that out, you can keep competitors out because they can\u2019t afford to build there own.", "2587 So it\u2019s a two-level thing. We need to solve the basic infrastructure. We need to build the buses and the roads. And we need to offer the service to those people that want to transit on those at a price that\u2019s affordable. And frankly, affordability is a big, big factor. I think we should be providing for low-income housing. I think we should remove the subsidy for voice and just provide them with data connectivity and access to educational programs. ", "2588 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: That actually answered a couple of my questions so I only have ---", "2589 MR. PROCTOR: So Commissioner MacDonald, if I could just add a bit to that one.", "2590 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yes, sir.", "2591 MR. PROCTOR: We currently operate under a regulated rate, the $80 a month plan that we\u2019re offering as our Basic Connect Package is in fact a rate that was set by Industry Canada under the Connecting Canadians Program. So we are following what was viewed to be affordable for the resources available, a package that\u2019s being offered.", "2592 What Jeff was explaining with respect to the two-step, we have two proposals and we obviously think that the first proposal, the first mechanism, the BAP, the Backbone Assistance Program, if properly designed and executed, should go all the way to being able to deliver what the Commission may deem to be affordable broadband and, for that matter, basic services that should go beyond broadband, should include voice.", "2593 To the extent that there may be a community or there may be a desire to have a lower price for either communities that are higher cost to serve or for individuals or groups of individuals who may not have the means, we\u2019ve proposed something a little bit different or an additional second mechanism, only if needed, call the Consumer Broadband Offer. And that\u2019s what Jeff was describing, the CBO. ", "2594 It\u2019s a variation on a life-line service that you might find down in the States, for example, where through a negative auction process you would determine how much funding may be needed in a given community to be able to deliver a lower-cost service to individuals who qualified to take that service. Through a negative auction you\u2019re actually, we believe, minimizing the uncertainty that up-top planning might cause in terms of what the right amount is. So the Commission may set a basic service package with a certain price and certain parameters around that.", "2595 If there are communities, once the Backbone Assistance Program is put is place, that are not receiving service to that level -- or for that matter, communities outside those that have a backbone -- an open gateway provider with the Backbone Assistance Program funding, we think that the CBO is an alternative or a second mechanism, a second-level mechanism to be able to deliver more affordable packages for consumers.", "2596 This differs somewhat. It looks somewhat like but it differs somewhat from the AAC proposal, as we understand it. We\u2019re not proposing for that to be an exclusive subsidy. If anything, it needs to be portable; it needs to be technology neutral; it needs to go to the consumer to choose whatever local service provider they want for whatever service they want. We\u2019ve been advocating that for several years.", "2597 We were very happy to see the Lifeline Program in the United States come out on March 31st that put in place those exact same rules. They have good experience with lifeline programs. They\u2019ve learned from the mistakes of the past. It is not an exclusive subsidy for ILX. It is an open subsidy, a portable subsidy of a very modest amount, I might add, but a portable subsidy that the consumer has to purchase mobile, broadband, fixed phone, whatever it might be, but from whatever service provider they want as well.", "2598 So again, our implementation mechanism is somewhat different than the U.S. lifeline or from the AAC proposal but the base rule behind it has to be transparent, technology-neutral, and absolutely competitive-neutral. It\u2019s meant for the consumer; it\u2019s not meant for the exclusive domain of an new incumbent monopoly.", "2599 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you. Just one final with respect to data caps. We\u2019re hearing some people suggest the minimum should 200; others say it should be unlimited. And since you are a service provider, I\u2019d just like to ask how you manage that with your customers. ", "2600 How do you interact with them if they are continually going over their allotted data cap? Do you encourage or force them to another package? Do you have any online tools that they can access so they can manage their usage throughout the month? What do you currently have in place?", "2601 MR. PROCTOR: We have been always -- we\u2019ve always been very customer-centric. So we have tools online. When a customer signs up for a package they can come into the office and sign up in three minutes; it\u2019s a very simple agreement. There is no contract -- no long-term contract so they pay their month fee. ", "2602 If they exceed their usage they\u2019re notified; so they get an email saying that \u201cYou\u2019ve exceeded your usage.\u201d They can check online; there\u2019s tools for them through the portal to check what their usage at any time is. When they exceed that monthly usage cap their modem is automatically downgraded to a slower speed; so we downgrade them to 96k download speed, send them a notice and say, \u201cHey, you\u2019ve been restricted so that you\u2019re not impacting the performance of other users who haven\u2019t exceeded their usage.\u201d ", "2603 They can continue at that speed for the remainder or the month -- it might be a day; it might be two weeks; it depends how quickly they use the usage -- or they can log into the portal and buy additional usage in one-gig increments. So if they want to buy an extra gig it will immediately reset their speed back to whatever there is, apply that usage into their account, and they can keep going until they exceed that, and then it will do the same thing, rate-limit them down to 96k but allow them to continue to utilize the service.", "2604 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good. Thank you. Those are my questions. I\u2019ll hand it back over to my colleagues.", "2605 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar? ", "2606 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So I understand you have long-term proposal here as it regards the wholesale access model but I want to talk to something perhaps a little more immediate.", "2607 Kativik was here yesterday and I\u2019m sure you know well there how they manage their customers. And they have government and the have their residential customers and utilize their capacity to manage them on a holistic basis and provide priorities and so on.", "2608 You mentioned you have as a customer both the government as well as many residential households. So what is it in the short term that would prohibit you from being able to manage the capacity on a more holistic basis such that maybe, you know, the households could take advantage of the full capacity that\u2019s available when it\u2019s unused by the government and vice versa?", "2609 MR. FRASER: That\u2019s a great question. When we did the Government of Nunavut RFP in 2009, they very specifically architected a network that was standalone. And to put this in perspective, there was not a lot of options at the time. QINIQ had been there for five years at this point. We were bidding ---", "2610 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So is the issue it\u2019s contractual?", "2611 MR. FRASER: No, it\u2019s actually physical architecture. We run a completely separate network so the capacity that is available in that computer system over there cannot even touch this one. They\u2019re physically separate networks, physically separate pieces of electronics -- and contractual. But frankly, the contractual I\u2019m sure we could overcome. The bigger challenge is, when the network was designed and architected and put to tender, we had no choice on how to bid it. We proposed, in fact, merging them but it wasn\u2019t acceptable at the time.", "2612 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So are there ways to address that separate and apart from your long-term plan as it regards all wholesale transport?", "2613 MR. FRASER: The Government of Nunavut contract will come up again for renewal in the next three years and at some point -- at that point we will -- and the Government of Nunavut wants to do this as well; don\u2019t get me wrong.", "2614 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Oh, they do?", "2615 MR. FRASER: Oh, it would make complete sense for them to be able to ---", "2616 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So the two of you folks can solve this problem yourselves and ---", "2617 MR. FRASER: I would say it\u2019s a little more complicated than that. We would have to win the public tender and our proposal has to be accepted, yes.", "2618 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah. Well, assuming that you\u2019re carrying both ---", "2619 MR. FRASER: Absolutely.", "2620 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- both of those customers on the transport ---", "2621 MR. FRASER: Yes.", "2622 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- you could collectively solve that without any of these and perhaps --- ", "2623 MR. PHILIPP: And potentially sooner.", "2624 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- in a shorter time frame than something like this would come (inaudible)?", "2625 MR. PHILIPP: And potentially even sooner, absolutely. We're in discussion with the GN about that, and on the point of sharing capacity, I believe that firmly. We've been working with Connected North for the last couple of years, so with Sysco, running a program called Connected North, which was providing our excess capacity into classrooms for high-definition video conferencing. ", "2626 So Sysco donated the hardware, we donated the capacity, Nunavut Broadband, in fact, brought capacity dollars to bear and we've been delivering distance education using our excess capacity outside of the GN network. ", "2627 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. I just wanted to address that, as I thought perhaps there was some short-term capacity that could be managed outside of this regulatory forum. ", "2628 MR. PHILIPP: That is certainly on our discussion list with the GN, yes. ", "2629 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. ", "2630 THE CHAIRPERSON: It's clear from your answers earlier that in your view, that the wholesale service you propose would be a rate-regulated service, correct? ", "2631 MR. PROCTOR: Yes, that's correct.", "2632 THE CHAIRPERSON: You also mention the high cost of satellite transport. Are you of the view that that's sufficiently competitive? ", "2633 MR. PROCTOR: Yes, we are.", "2634 THE CHAIRPERSON: At this point, for not -- yes? Why? ", "2635 MR. PROCTOR: Jeff's done most of the negotiations. That's probably the best person to answer that. ", "2636 MR. PHILIPP: You know, we've worked in Africa, Indonesia, the South Pacific. We've worked with other satellite providers. We've looked at satellite capacity in contracts from all of these providers, and it always comes down to a couple of variables. ", "2637 It's not just the price per megahertz, it's the EIRP, the effect of irradiated power on the ground. How bright is your flashlight compared to the next guy's? It's what size antenna do we need? What size transmitter do we need, because the cost of power is so high? ", "2638 So we take all of this into account and frankly, I've had a love/hate relationship with Telesat for a long time, but I make no bones about it. I will tell them what I'm unhappy about and what I'm happy about. ", "2639 The pricing that we get for C-band, especially in this last round, was very competitive. We went to multiple -- every provider. In fact, we went to providers that didn\u2019t have enough capacity and asked if they could move satellites into position before we concluded a deal with Telesat. ", "2640 So on the C-band terms that we have now, I don\u2019t believe for a minute that there are significantly better deals to be had. It was a very good deal and a win-win for Telesat and for us, I would say. ", "2641 But on Ka band, on high throughput, there's lots of negotiation to be done yet on what is a payload worth? What would that payload look like? If it's for 15 years or it's covering the mid north and the north, it's serving 150 communities, and at that point, the cost per community, the cost per transponder, becomes far, far cheaper. But it depends on the design of the architecture. ", "2642 THE CHAIRPERSON: So -- sorry, but so not necessarily -- you're still hopeful that market forces would deal with the high throughput Ka band? ", "2643 MR. PHILIPP: We have, as part of our contract, we will take some initial high throughput from Telesat, but it doesn\u2019t lock us into a 15-year commitment with them and it will give us the opportunity to start to work with other providers as well as Telesat to find out what is available that would be potentially cheaper in high throughput. But the only way to get any of this cheap enough is to commit longer term to it. We can't be buying in four-year commitments. It doesn\u2019t work for Telesat either. ", "2644 MR. PROCTOR: And to do the package totally, the best way to look at the satellite is as dark fibre. You still have to light that fibre. That takes a lot of electronics, a lot of operating costs on the ground. So it's one component and it is a negotiated component, being the transponder space or the fibre coming in, whatever else it might be, in terms of the backbone. ", "2645 That's why the open gateway concept is so, we believe, critical. The fibre coming into a community, the satellite serving the community, is only one component of it. You still have to have a lot of other pieces to light up and make workable that backbone. So that's why it's a whole piece, it's a holistic view. ", "2646 THE CHAIRPERSON: Understood. ", "2647 I believe legal has a question or two. MS. HAMLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ", "2648 In respect to the federal, provincial, or territorial government funding that you\u2019ve received to cover the cost of broadband internet infrastructure, we would ask that you undertake to provide the following information by May 5th: ", "2649 First, the amount of funding received for each funding program for the purpose of offsetting satellite transport costs, if you could provide this information by program and by year. ", "2650 And second, during the years in which you received this funding from these programs, what were the annual costs and capacity for the satellite transport services which you used to provision broadband internet in your serving territory? ", "2651 Can you do that by May 5th? ", "2652 MR. PROCTOR: We can certainly do that by May 5th. ", "2653 ", "UNDERTAKING", "2654 If I could just add an editorial or a footnote to that, I would like to point out to the Commission schedule 2 to last July's intervention by us, and it's a report actually prepared by Lemay-Yates, which is a more global view. It's a discussion of subsidies and investment in rural and remote areas. ", "2655 We'll certainly give you specifics of our numbers but this is a more global view of what's happened in Canada over the last few years. ", "2656 I'd also like to point out, given that in our particular case, we only receive funding for the Territories, for the Northwest Territories and for Nunavut, you did ask, \"What about provincial and territorial funding?\" ", "2657 There was a phenomenon, not a pleasant one, in Nunavut and in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon. When you look at federal programs connecting Canadians -- Broadband Canada, (inaudible) before that, the infrastructure Canada programs before that -- there was a federal prohibition on stacking. That means that you cannot get two sources of funding for the same program. ", "2658 So when KRG's in front of you, they give you a very nice breakdown of what federal funding is, what provincial funding is, what their own regional funding may be. There is no provincial, or if you want territorial funding for Nunavut, it actually runs contrary to federal stacking rules. ", "2659 So I'm just adding that one as a note. When one looks at the amount of funding that may be available in Territories, there's actually a permanent handicap, in terms of the amount of government funding that can actually be allocated, which affects obviously the amount of funding that is allocated to Nunavut from government sources. ", "2660 MS. HAMLEY: Thank you. ", "2661 THE CHAIRPERSON: Because the money territorial governments get from the federal government is deemed a grant or contribution to the same level as a grant and contribution from the resources. ", "2662 MR. PROCTOR: The definition of a Catch-22, that's right. ", "2663 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, okay. I get -- was aware of the stacking rules. I didn\u2019t realize the application of it in this case. ", "2664 Okay, good, thank you very much. ", "2665 We will hear -- thank you, those are our questions and we'll move on to hear the next intervener. ", "2666 Madame la secr\u00e9taire. ", "2667 THE SECRETARY: Merci. ", "2668 We'll now connect via Skype. ", "2669 Hi, Ms. Shepherd. Can you hear me well? We cannot hear you. Maybe you're on mute?", "2670 MS. SHEPHERD: I don't think so. ", "2671 THE SECRETARY: Okay, yeah, now it's working. ", "2672 Hi, how are you? Welcome. ", "2673 MS. SHEPHERD: Hi. Thank you. ", "2674 THE SECRETARY: So you may begin your presentation. You have 10 minutes.", "PRESENTATION ", "2675 MS. SHEPHERD: All right, thank you.", "2676 Good morning, and thank you to the Commission for your time today.", "2677 The question of basic service, as it has been posed in the notice of consultation and in many of the interventions and comments we've heard so far, tends to be rationalized primarily in relation to the digital economy.", "2678 As a researcher of digital culture and telecommunications policy, I'm an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, studying those things. I aim to offer a perspective within this hearing that broadens the digital economy framings of basic service. ", "2679 Canada\u2019s digital economy framework has been critiqued by myself and others for its narrow and instrumental focus on things like digital skills training for workers and innovation in the digital technologies sector.", "2680 But what we are talking about, and I think it's clear in this hearing, by using the term \"basic service\" is something much more fundamental, something that is basic, by definition, forms an essential first principle upon which all else rests. Seen in this light, the consultation addresses the practice of communicating itself as the basis for not only economic, social and cultural ends, but the very fact of an economy, a society, and a culture in themselves.", "2681 And increasingly, it's clear that the contemporary and future infrastructures needed to support this kind of basic practice of communication are predicated on broadband internet. A variety of delivery mechanisms for fixed and wireless broadband combine to create digital infrastructure. These physical manifestations of basic service have been the focus of much of this consultation so far.", "2682 What I aim to add today is a consideration of the demand side of basic service, rather than primarily the supply side, as it\u2019s typically discussed. The supply side questions, while crucial, don\u2019t necessarily provide a full picture of how to meet broader policy objectives of economic growth, citizen engagement, and cultural flourishing.", "2683 The infrastructures supporting such outcomes, while necessary, are not sufficient. As the concept of \"affordances\" suggests, the success of technical systems rests on the interactions between technologies and the people using them. ", "2684 So what I want to ask today is what kinds of communication does improved digital connectivity afford for Canadians?", "2685 To answer such a question, I shift the focus onto the people implicated often invisibly in this consultation. These are Canadian citizens. When viewed broadly, not only in digital economy terms that see citizens primarily as economic engines, as either workers or consumers, Canadians express multiple and at times conflicting motivations, desires, and understandings around digital connectivity.", "2686 For example, in my submissions I referenced a longitudinal review of the Canadian Internet Use Survey conducted by myself and Ryerson University Professor Catherine Middleton. While the most recent survey conducted in 2012 shows that most Canadians, nearly 84 percent, view internet connectivity as a necessity, as a basic service, or as a kind of utility, like we can think of electricity or water, a significant proportion, so 16 percent, remain offline for the most part.", "2687 Within this group of Canadians who do not connect to the internet regularly, we found a dual digital divide, represented by two distinct camps of non-users, those who are either non-users by choice or non-users due to involuntary circumstances. And these involuntary circumstances include things like the prohibitive costs of service, lack of access to infrastructure, and lack of skills or training. And while these barriers seem to shift in frequency over the years of the survey\u2019s results, the proportion of non-users by choice or due to lack of motivation seems to remain relatively small but consistent.", "2688 One of the chief reasons claimed by survey respondents for choosing to remain offline, corresponded with advanced age. And I think this is a really important demographic to highlight in this consultation given the ageing Canadian population which tends to be overlooked in much of the digital economy framework. ", "2689 The choice made by older Canadians not to connect potentially, is a demand-side issue that won\u2019t necessarily be addressed by improvements to digital infrastructures. And it\u2019s important not only in light of basic communication needs but also considering the trend toward the provision of essential health services through online portals. How will this increasingly large proportion of the Canadian population be served by the regulation of basic service?", "2690 Moreover, age-related reasons for choosing not to connect to the internet may also be seen to correlate with socioeconomic concerns about affordability, as we\u2019ve heard a lot about, as well as the more social phenomenon of having no need or interest in connecting. ", "2691 And I\u2019m raising these points in order to highlight how consideration of specific groups of people affected by digital infrastructures, especially those who experience the most barriers to connection, often challenges the version of average Canadians as imagined by the digital economy framework.", "2692 The distinct needs of these different groups of Canadians, beyond the digital economy and its implied target populations of workers and consumers, demand more social policy considerations.", "2693 Social policy is of course embedded within the seemingly technical regulatory decisions, such as those around target download and upload speeds, data caps, and latency. So for example, yesterday we heard from the First Mile Connectivity Consortium who noted the deficiencies in current service provision in northern communities. And these deficiencies show a bigger picture of how social inequalities have become even further entrenched through technical means, where the isolation experienced by members of these communities often gets compounded rather than rectified by digital connectivity.", "2694 What such an example further demonstrates is the need to define basic service not only in terms of specific technologies, but as a broader concern with the reliability, affordability, and quality of connections. These more complex and intersecting dimensions of basic service suggests that a simple appeal to market forces is insufficient for ensuring that all Canadians can benefit from improved communications infrastructure.", "2695 And this is true across various parties\u2019 interventions in this consultation, where it can be seen that market forces are a contentious issue. Some service providers portray a dynamic and competitive Canadian marketplace for telecommunications services, while others describe an unfair and asymmetrical marketplace. Individual intervenors and consumer and public interest groups often question market logic altogether, noting the fallacy of the invisible hand as an assurance that the needs of demographically varied and geographically dispersed populations will be met.", "2696 The disconnect between various intervenors\u2019 perspectives on the ability of competitive market forces to support all Canadians\u2019 access to basic telecommunications services, points toward the inherent problems with primarily market-based solutions. As such, moving forward with funding and subsidies for the least-served constituencies are crucial to maintain as broadband internet becomes defined as a basic service.", "2697 The first step toward the articulation of appropriate regulatory safeguards is improved research and measurement of the reliability, affordability, and quality of existing digital infrastructures. Such monitoring will help to identify supply-side inequalities.", "2698 But it needs to be matched with other kinds of research on the demand side. So more robust and reliable national surveys that can be conducted as part of the renewed commitment to the long-form census and support for qualitative programs of research by advocacy organizations, community groups, and university researchers, is needed on how diverse populations of Canadians are negotiating digital connectivity.", "2699 Acquiring a better understanding of the people who are implicitly at the heart of this consultation, suggests a suite of policy instruments based on a version of basic service that acknowledges how fundamental these regulatory decisions are for people\u2019s everyday lives.", "2700 A broader notion of basic service reaches beyond the imperatives of the digital economy to make space for Canadians not only as workers or consumers, but as citizens who participate at all levels of governance, who create and share cultural expression, who learn and who teach, who explore the world, who connect with family and friends, and who come to know themselves in and through digital infrastructures.", "2701 So thank you very much for your attention and I welcome any further questions.", "2702 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for that.", "2703 Commissioner Molnar?", "2704 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Good morning. I believe it\u2019s morning in Calgary.", "2705 MS. SHEPHERD: It is.", "2706 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. I have only a couple of questions for you. And first of all I want to understand, sort of, the fundamental premise of your comments here today.", "2707 You begin with a concern that we have a focus on the economy. Based on the record of this proceeding, which is exhaustive, as well as what you may have heard in the last day or so, what leads you to conclude that our focus is solely on engagement in the economy and not civic engagement, cultural engagement, social engagement?", "2708 MS. SHEPHERD: Okay, thank you. Yeah.", "2709 This has of course come up in the further discourse generated by this proceeding. But I\u2019m just referring to the preliminary description in the TMZ, which for me is really the whole purpose of the consultation in the language of the digital economy.", "2710 And my kind of concern (inaudible) this language is that it tends to potentially limit some of the further implications of the hearing and the proceeding. So for example, in discussing the issue of speeds, which had come up a number of times, the sort of implicit assumption is that download speeds would need to be higher than, let\u2019s say, upload speeds because the uses that we\u2019re imagining for people who are, sort of, communicating over those speeds are primarily consumption-based. So they\u2019re primarily downloading as opposed to uploading.", "2711 And this I think reinforces the position that the average user is a consumer primarily, first and foremost, as opposed to an interlocutor or somebody who is using this sort of two-way (inaudible) of broadband internet.", "2712 So this is just sort of what I mean about relying too heavily on the framing implied by the digital economy, is that it narrows and potentially restricts some of the possibilities that could be entertained through this proceeding. But of course as you point out, in the broader, sort of, diversity of input into the proceedings, we have heard lots of alternative framings of the rationale behind basic service.", "2713 So yes, you\u2019re right that that\u2019s true. I just wanted to have it on the record that this digital economy framing is the sort of predominant framing that tends to be used as the key benefit that might potentially restrict some of the things we talk about.", "2714 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, fair enough. You\u2019re on record and I can speak only for myself that certainly as we\u2019re looking at what are the needs of Canadians for access and issues around adoption, certainly we are considering their needs much more broadly than simply the economy. I mean, needs are needs. I mean, you\u2019ve heard plenty of conversation about needs for education, for example, right?", "2715 And we have heard the conversations about cultural and social and so on and how that\u2019s all important for a communication system to support.", "2716 The record also does have a lot of information as it regards adoption and what may be influencing adoption, be it access, be it affordability, be it literacy. Do you see anything missing on the record that you\u2019d like to highlight that should be considered?", "2717 MS. SHEPHERD: Yes, thanks.", "2718 Well, based on the research that Dr. Middleton and I have conducted on the Canadian Internet Use Survey, one of the things we found in looking at the changes to the survey over time, were changing descriptions of the sort of motivations behind people choosing to not connect, so those are non-users by choice, or not being able to connect, non-users by circumstance. And the reasons, as you said, have included things like affordability, access, but also things like digital literacy. Reasons such as age, reasons such as seeing no need for connecting have been stated. ", "2719 And the main sort of issue with this diversity of reasons is that the survey changes every year. So it\u2019s difficult to track the persistence of those reasons given over time.", "2720 And that\u2019s why one of my sort of goals here is to put forward the call that potentially the CRTC could help in providing, or at least making the case to federal agencies like Statistics Canada, for reinstating, first of all, the Canadian Internet Use Survey; creating a kind of more robust survey, one that maintains certain questions over time so that the results can be tracked a little bit better without the sort of gaps that we see now; and adding more, sort of, qualitative research as well.", "2721 So the EKOS report is a great example of this. If we could have, sort of, more work like that being done, I think you would get a better picture of exactly this question of needs that we\u2019ve been trying to define.", "2722 So really my call is for more research as supported by the CRTC in whatever capacity it can be supportive. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean funding the research, although that would be nice, but also, you know, working in partnership with other federal agencies to, you know, create more robust terms of measurement.", "2723 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. Those are my questions and I think you managed to explain well your call for research. So that\u2019s all I have. Thank you.", "2724 THE CHAIRPERSON: A few more questions.", "2725 Commissioner Vennard?", "2726 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good morning. Can you hear me?", "2727 MS. SHEPHERD: Yes.", "2728 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, hi.", "2729 I understand what you\u2019re saying, that we tend to focus on the supply side of things because you\u2019re kind of using that economic model yourself of supply and demand.", "2730 In your submission, you say in a couple of places that we need certain sorts of policy solutions but you don\u2019t really suggest any. And I would just like to give you the opportunity to briefly suggest one, possibly two, that you think would be appropriate, that would be focused at what you\u2019re referring to as your demand side?", "2731 MS. SHEPHERD: Yes. Thank you.", "2732 So I think on the one hand the question that has already come up for digital literacy and skills training and whether that should fall somewhere under the (inaudible) of the CRTC\u2019s policy activities, would be one place to start developing more social policy in this area. And I think it does (inaudible) the CRTC\u2019s goals, especially in terms of this question of adoption we\u2019ve been hearing about.", "2733 So that would be one answer, is something -- I don\u2019t know exactly what it would look like, but developing something on the side of digital literacy, whether that\u2019s, you know, committed support for Canadians that are aged already in communities (inaudible) digital literacy. That\u2019s already happening. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to reinvent the wheel there. But there are support groups that are already engaged in this kind of (inaudible). So for example, like media (inaudible) and groups like that.", "2734 I think media literacy and skills-training programs could be sort of a condition that\u2019s attached to, let\u2019s say, subsidies for the development of infrastructure in underserved communities. So that could be one sort of piece of the puzzle.", "2735 As we just heard from SSi, the part that people don\u2019t usually talk about is the community labour involved in maintaining infrastructure in places that are remote. So the other part, the sort of human side to this infrastructure question in terms of the literacy training.", "2736 And second, I think extending the CRTC\u2019s current attempts to make participation in these types of proceedings acceptable, is really important. So in (inaudible) more diverse groups of Canadians to participate in hearings to have their voices be heard and to be represented. And that\u2019s already happening (inaudible) going further in that direction (inaudible) potentially through partnerships with (inaudible) universities. ", "2737 I know in my own university a lot of the graduate students haven\u2019t heard of these abilities to participate in hearings. So they hadn\u2019t heard of, for example, (inaudible) to try to get the word out (inaudible) universities and schools to enable people to know, which I think already there\u2019s really good things (inaudible) in terms of this kind of outreach.", "2738 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "2739 MS. SHEPHERD: Yeah.", "2740 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Oh, are you finished?", "2741 MS. SHEPHERD: Yes.", "2742 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Did you have more to add?", "2743 MS. SHEPHERD: I\u2019m okay for now, thanks.", "2744 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you. Those are my questions.", "2745 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.", "2746 You referred to older Canadians. And I was wondering to what extent, setting aside affordability issues because that\u2019s a separate issues, in terms of needs, has your study covered the fact that when government services move online or when newspapers move online -- sort of, other types of services and applications that older Canadians might value -- that that\u2019s actually a mover for those Canadians? And although they may have preferred to get their newspaper at the front door on paper, that they are actually changing their perspective on the need, assuming they can afford it?", "2747 MS. SHEPHERD: Yes. So your question touches on the key thing here, which is clearly affordability, in a lot of the research that I\u2019ve been part of on older Canadians, which is mostly around cellular telephones and wireless, mobile broadband.", "2748 So yes, affordability aside, yes, I think that according to the CIUS some of the reasons for those groups of non-users who are choosing not to connect, which many of them are seniors, is that they don\u2019t see the value. So I think you\u2019re right that this will change our plan, but then it\u2019s really difficult to see that in the survey results because of the ways that the survey has changed over time. And that survey was disconnected, so to speak, after 2012. ", "2749 So if it gets reinstated there would be a kind of gap there of (inaudible), which it would be difficult to trace the influence of the (inaudible) online sort of provision of these kinds of services, as you mentioned.", "2750 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Well, thank you for that.", "2751 By the way, we\u2019re not insensitive to the need for consistent data and gathering. And we do our best to try to ensure that, for instance, Canada does continue to invest in a consistent measuring tool. So we\u2019re on that. I can\u2019t guarantee results but we\u2019re on that. ", "2752 Okay? Thank you.", "2753 Those are our questions. I don\u2019t know. No, nothing from legal. So why don\u2019t we take a break until 1:30 and we\u2019ll resume with the other interveners at that point.", "2754 Donc, nous sommes en pause jusqu\u2019\u00e0 13h30.

Please introduce yourself and your colleagues and you have 10 minutes for your presentation.", "PRESENTATION ", "2758 MR. EMON: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Chair, and Commissioners. ", "2759 Good afternoon. My name is Peter Emon. I am the Warden of Renfrew County and the Chair of the Eastern Ontario Wardens\u2019 Caucus. ", "2760 The Wardens' Caucus are elected -- the elected representatives of 750,000 residents of Eastern Ontario. ", "2761 With me today are my colleagues from the Eastern Ontario Wardens' Caucus and the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, who I am pleased to introduce. ", "2762 Appearing to my left is Reeve Dave Burton from Highland East and the Chair of the Eastern Ontario Regional Network; Warden Francis Smith of Frontenac County; Dr. Reza Rajabiun, who is our consultant; Warren Arseneau, director of the Eastern Ontario Regional Network.", "2763 On my right is Warden J. Murray Jones. He's the Warden of Peterborough County and Vice Chair of the Eastern Ontario Regional Network as well as Eastern Ontario Wardens' Caucus. And we have David Fell, who is the CEO of the Eastern Ontario Regional Network. ", "2764 Behind me, I have Paula Preston, Eastern Ontario Regional Network Engineering Manager and Claudio Menendez, Eastern Ontario Regional Network Project Manager.", "2765 The Eastern Ontario Wardens\u2019 Caucus works as a team on behalf of 13 county and single tier municipalities representing 750,000 residents. We also work quite closely with the Eastern Ontario Mayors' Committee, which represents 500,000 residents.", "2766 The Eastern Ontario Warden's Caucus' mission is to monitor federal, provincial and municipal legislation, regulatory and government information, and to conduct research and analysis for purposes of influencing and advocating enhanced municipal service delivery in Eastern Ontario.", "2767 We are here today because access to basic communications services represents a common challenge for our communities. For over a decade, our residents, businesses, and public service agencies have identified limited access to the internet as a key barrier to economic development in Eastern Ontario.", "2768 In response, and in cooperation with our provincial and federal partners, the Eastern Ontario Wardens' Caucus has developed the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, which serves as the vehicle for extending broadband access and improving internet speeds across the region.", "2769 I would like to highlight for the Commission why we are asking the CRTC to redefine fixed and mobile high speed access as basic services under the Telecommunications Act and outline the recommendations we have detailed in our written submission. ", "2770 As you are aware, lower levels of government such as ours, represented in the Eastern Ontario Wardens' Caucus, have become increasingly responsible since the 1990s for delivering public services and economic infrastructure which helps retain and attract residents and businesses to our communities.", "2771 Although this trend allows local communities to develop solutions that meet their individual needs, small rural communities such as ours have limited means to raise funds from taxes or to divert resources from social services to infrastructure development.", "2772 At the same time, the business case for investing in the private delivery of public infrastructure -- for example schools, clinics, transport, and communications infrastructure -- can be very limited or non-existent in the rural communities we represent. Our experience with the development of broadband and mobile networks in Eastern Ontario over the past decade shows clearly that under-investment in rural network infrastructure is real.", "2773 On the other hand, the Eastern Ontario experience also shows that different levels of government can work together to address market failures in a way that promotes, rather than discourages, private-sector incentives to invest in providing affordable and reliable services to our communities.", "2774 We have argued in our responses to the Commission and to Rogers in this matter, that under the approach that the Eastern Ontario Wardens' Caucus and the Eastern Ontario Regional Network have recommended, to include fixed and mobile broadband in the basic service framework, would actually increase investment and competition by private providers to serve the needs of our communities.", "2775 Where market forces are inadequate it is the responsibility of elected representatives such as ourselves and agencies such as the Commission to address the problems facing residents, businesses, and the broader public sector in under-serviced communities.", "2776 Some of the parties arguing that the size of the current gaps are small and that market forces are sufficient to meet these demands, have as recently as just over a year ago received significant subsidies from Eastern Ontario Regional Network and other public sector organizations.", "2777 Although we look forward to continuing our work and building future partnerships with all service providers willing to invest in Eastern Ontario, we strongly disagree with the contention that the mission has been accomplished or that the infrastructure subsidies from the new federal budget will be sufficient to address rural market failures across Canada. ", "2778 In addition to evidence detailed in our written submission, the record of this proceeding offers a wide range of evidence from other rural communities and advocates for under-serviced communities from all regions of Canada that are essentially consistent with our recommendations.", "2779 Commitments to rural Canada are explicit in the Telecom Act, and a fundamental expectation of Canadian federalism. ", "2780 I will now ask Reeve Burton, the Chair of Eastern Ontario Regional Network, to elaborate on the concerns raised by the federal regulatory framework for Eastern Ontario.", "2781 Reeve Burton?", "2782 MR. BURTON: Thank you, Warden. With financial support from the provincial and federal governments, the Eastern Ontario Wardens' Caucus has responded to the demands for more stakeholders by setting up the Eastern Ontario Regional Network. ", "2783 Through Eastern Ontario Regional Network, we have made significant investments in the transport and broadband access networks and serve residents, businesses and public sector organization across Eastern Ontario. ", "2784 As a result, the region has also experienced significant improvements in terms of broadband coverage, which is delivered to residents and businesses through our private partners.", "2785 Without substantive public investments, we are confident that the incentives for the operators to meet the needs of our residents, businesses, and public sector agencies would have remained limited.", "2786 Without public sector leadership through Eastern Ontario Wardens' Caucus and the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, it is clear that rural parts of Eastern Ontario would have continued to fall behind in terms of broadband access.", "2787 We are here today because we recognize that despite our past efforts and achievements, the job has not yet finished.", "2788 Much like urban parts of Canada, demand for broadband internet and mobile services is rapidly growing in Eastern Ontario. The experience in Eastern Ontario, and other rural communities from across the country submitted to the record of this proceeding, indicate the lack of access affordable transport capacity represents a key barrier in overcoming market failures in our communities.", "2789 In Eastern Ontario, even the incumbent was not willing to extend or upgrade its regional transport network or give service providers access to available capacity before Eastern Ontario Wardens' Caucus and EORN stepped in with the inducements to form the public subsidies.", "2790 Without forward looking public policies that generate funds needed to improve the business case for investing in fixed broadband and mobile networks in our communities, we will not be able to engage market forces in serving our communities with essential communications services.", "2791 It is precisely for these reasons that we recommend the Commission expand the range of basic service to include both fixed and mobile high speed access and to develop a sustainable cross-subsidy mechanism to support initiatives by lower tiers levels of government trying to meet demands for their communities for better connectivity.", "2792 Warden Jones from Peterborough Country will elaborate on some of the challenges we are currently trying to address in Eastern Ontario in terms of access to basic services.", "2793 MR. JONES: Thank you very much and thank you for having us here today. ", "2794 Since our colleagues have outlined some of our key concerns about the federal regulatory framework, I will focus on some of the specific problems that EOWC and EORN have addressed, and we are trying to overcome here today in response to demand by our stakeholders.", "2795 As my colleagues pointed out, in Eastern Ontario we have recognized that market forces are not sufficient to meet the needs of our residents and our businesses and our visitors in terms of broadband access or mobile connectivity.", "2796 As Canadians that live and work in rural communities, this is not a surprise to us as we long ago recognized that if we don\u2019t solve our own problems, nobody else will.", "2797 The EOWC therefore set up EORN, the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, to negotiate with private sector entities to extend their broadband networks and to improve the capacity of their networks to meet the needs of Eastern Ontario stakeholders.", "2798 Now, in setting our original coverage and our speed objectives for EORN back in 2009, we determined that the national minimum service standards as defined by the CRTC, and which the Commission is reviewing in this proceeding, were inadequate to meet the needs of the region at the time and we adopted even higher speed targets.", "2799 As detailed in our written submission, EORN has achieved speed targets that are substantially higher than the CRTC standard and the previous federal rural broadband development programs.", "2800 Having achieved our objective of delivering speeds of 10 megabits per second download and 1 up, to more than 90 percent of the Region in 2014, we recognize the need for ongoing investments to meet the growing demands of our residents beyond our current speeds and our current capacity. ", "2801 Besides continuing to improve broadband speeds across the region, we are engaged in a number of strategic initiatives to address emerging concerns, which help explain why it is imperative for the Commission to institute a sustainable cross-subsidy mechanism to improve connectivity in rural communities such as Eastern Ontario.", "2802 Now over the past number of years we have had many complaints from our residents, our businesses and even emergency workers about the coverage and capacity of mobile networks in the region. ", "2803 To evaluate these concerns, last year we retained an independent engineering company to map mobile network coverage and capacity gaps in all of Eastern Ontario, so this was not guess work.", "2804 Consequently, last year the EOWC identified a project aimed at closing mobile network coverage and capacity gaps as a strategic priority.", "2805 Achieving this priority will require substantive commitments by the Eastern Ontario Wardens Caucus, that\u2019s for sure, as well as higher levels of government and mobile network infrastructure operators that serve our region. We\u2019re all in this together.", "2806 Access to mobile data services and reducing coverage gaps represents an important problem for many of the communities that we represent, particularly with respect to reliable connectivity needed for using information technology applications by our emergency service workers.", "2807 We urge the Commission to include both fixed and mobile broadband/high-speed internet access into the basic service framework.", "2808 We also urge the Commission to develop an industry funding mechanism of sufficient scale that helps close the gap in terms of access to these basic services in rural and remote communities.", "2809 We live in a world of rural Ontario much different than the city life and I think you all probably know that.", "2810 And I think I spent half my time as warden of Peterborough county trying to say that life does exist outside the city limits and I keep trying to hammer that away and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to say today as well. Thank you for listening. ", "2811 Warden Smith? She\u2019ll elaborate on our recommendations on this matter. Thank you.", "2812 MS. WARDEN: Thank you. Good afternoon, I am Francis Smith, Warden of Frontenac County and thank you for hearing us out today.", "2813 Given the concerns and evidence we have provided, as well as evidence from other rural communities in this proceeding, we hope the Commission recognizes that broadband internet access and mobile services are already essential services for most Canadians, regardless of where they live.", "2814 At the same time market, forces or one time infrastructure infusions, are not sufficient for ensuring that coverage, affordability, and service quality gaps across the urban-rural divide are addressed, or prevented from growing further with the increasing demands for service.", "2815 On behalf of the Eastern Ontario Wardens Caucus and the communities we represent, I urge the Commission to consider our needs and interest in this proceeding by adopting recommendations we have detailed in our written submission.", "2816 To promote private sector incentives to meet current and future needs of rural and remote communities across the country, we submit the Commission should, number one, redefine high-speed/broadband Internet access as a basic service under the Telecommunications Act. ", "2817 Any other decision would be inconsistent with the reality that broadband is already essential to most Canadians. ", "2818 The vast majority of parties to this proceeding and Canadians according to CRTC surveys, agree with this recommendation.", "2819 Number two; include high-speed mobile broadband access services in the definition of basic broadband services. ", "2820 Mobile network coverage and the availability of high-speed mobile data service with minimum service quality guarantees are critical for communications between our residents, visitors, and emergency service workers. ", "2821 This issue has not been discussed as extensively as fixed broadband by other parties, but we hope the Commission recognizes its importance for rural Canada.", "2822 Number three; mandate forward looking national standards. Existing aspirational speed targets were inadequate when the Commission adopted them five years ago and remain so today. ", "2823 We urge the Commission to mandate that operators provide minimum service quality guarantees to residential and business users at a reasonable price, as many Internet applications require sustained speeds and reliability.", "2824 And number four; develop a sustainable industry funded cross-subsidy mechanism. ", "2825 Although one time infrastructure investments can overcome some rural conductivity problems, without sustained commitments by the public sector, rural communities are likely to fall behind and we don\u2019t want that to happen. ", "2826 Thank you for your time and if we can answer some of your questions, please.", "2827 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well thank you very much for being here and in such large numbers. It\u2019s appreciated and it demonstrates how important this is to you and I \u2013- particularly I know that you\u2019re -- you\u2019ve got other things to do than appear at CRTC hearings and the busy lives you have.", "2828 So I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner Vennard to start us off.", "2829 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good afternoon. Pardon me. Thank you for coming to talk to us today.", "2830 I have several questions for you, some of which relate to decisions that you have made already and also ones that you are going to be making in the future as well as your perspectives. ", "2831 I think in that regard it would be very useful if you would give us kind of a holistic view of your decision-making process, just to put it in context for us. ", "2832 Otherwise we\u2019ll just be asking different -- I\u2019ll be asking you different questions and the conversation will go all over the place.", "2833 So I\u2019m wondering if somebody, if one of you -- and I\u2019ve tried to sort of put into areas that will be easy to -- for someone to respond to. ", "2834 If you could tell me a little bit about your organisational structure, and again, I\u2019m interested in the decision-making process that you had. ", "2835 Your governance, how -- exactly what your organisation is. So if somebody could speak to that for a couple moments?", "2836 I\u2019d also like someone to tell me a little bit about your network structure. The kind of technologies you have, okay, your partners, the ownership of the network and so on. ", "2837 So that we can once again get a little bit better idea of how you make your decisions and where your perspective comes from.", "2838 And then finally I\u2019d like somebody to just elaborate on what you call the EORN model, which shows up on paragraph 18 of your submission.", "2839 And maybe somebody could just encapsulate that for us in a short brief overview. ", "2840 So let\u2019s just start with your structure, your governance, your decision-making processes and so on?", "2841 MR. FELL: Thank you very much for the questions. Hopefully you\u2019ll remind me of questions two and three later on. ", "2842 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure. ", "2843 MR. FELL: And also to supplement we\u2019ve put information packages about background material and on our digital strategy and the information package. ", "2844 So the Wardens Caucus, that some of our members represent, are the 13 upper tier governments outside of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario. It covers about 55,000 square kilometres. ", "2845 They came together in mid-2004-2005, to advocate for rural issues in Eastern Ontario. They did a substantial amount of research at the time and have continued to do a substantial amount of research on the economic realities of living in Eastern Ontario.", "2846 And back in 2007 and 8, they identified broadband as one of the number one economic development goals required for the region in order to participate in the modern economy. ", "2847 They pulled that research together. They put $10 million of their own money on the table and were able to partner with the federal and provincial governments to secure funding, $55 million from the province and $55 million from the federal government.", "2848 We entered into a joint agreement. The Wardens Caucus did and they formed EORN as the organization that would be the delivery mechanism for this project.", "2849 So EORN is not -- it\u2019s a non-profit, non-share capital corporation with a Board of Directors. My Board members are here today. The EOWC substantively controls EORN through its five seats on our Board and then we have four additional public members. It's a public/private partnership.", "2850 So in terms of our governance, did you also want background information on how we made the decision?", "2851 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, just briefly how you go about making your decisions because you made some important decisions on behalf of the people that you represent and I'm interested in knowing how that's structured, how that came about.", "2852 MR. FELL: So we did go through a thorough process at the time. I think one of the wardens mentioned that the targets at the time, I believe the national targets are 1.5 down and 500 kilobytes per second. We set aspirational targets of 10 by 1 and we believe we are looking forward. We are trying to build a forward-looking network.", "2853 We went through a request for information process to the private sector and asked for their input. We initially designed the network and the backhaul component and we thought that we needed 60 PoPs or points of presence in order to get access in the region. We ended up getting feedback on that through the RFI process.", "2854 And when we secured the funding from senior levels of government, it was contingent on bringing private sector money to the table as well. And when we ended going through a full RFP, it was a competitive process. Large, medium, small providers, ISPs were invited to bid and they did and we ended with 160 points of presence throughout the region.", "2855 We used the services of both County of Peterborough and County of Hastings to assist in the financial management and procurement. We had a very thorough, open, transparent procurement process and we had quite a representative team that worked on the review process for the submissions to the RFP. We had legal representatives. We had business representatives. We had municipal representatives. We had independent advisors as well.", "2856 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. And the funding for that, can you run that by me again? Where did the funding for that come from?", "2857 MR. FELL: Sure. The Wardens Caucus started by putting $10 million on the table and that was proportionally shared out amongst the 13 members.", "2858 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "2859 MR. FELL: The provincial government contributed $55 million. The federal government contributed $55 million and that was through Infrastructure Canada funding at the time. I believe we were the only broadband infrastructure project in that. It's typically used for roads and bridges and things like that. And it was a two-thirds, one-third matching formula. So when we went out to the market, we needed to raise a minimum of a third from the private sector and we were absolutely able to do that.", "2860 The total cash in-kind value of the project is $175 million but with the in-kind and fiber assets that were added in by the private sector, we valued the total project in the region at about $260 million.", "2861 I will say we had a small team of which I'm very proud to have some of the members here today. We had 13 staff. We managed that -- EORN managed that entire project on 5.2 percent admin overhead.", "2862 MR. EMON: If I might add about the history, EORN came about -- Eastern Ontario Wardens Caucus and EORN came about in 2007 and \u201908. There was a series of provincial and federal programs for funding for broadband and they were just sort of thrown on the table and we were scrambling around as a series of small municipalities, 103 of us, looking for that money.", "2863 And what happened was some of the projects were very successful in that you built capacity but there were large swaths of territory in between those dots on the map and it became very apparent that system wasn\u2019t going to work. And that's how the strategy was then germinated as a question, how can we make it better, how can we get, you know, a certain percentage, a 100 percent or whatever, of coverage for our whole area and then that's how the strategy evolved.", "2864 So it was out of necessity and it was out of frustration as well because we thought -- a lot of us thought this is a lot of money and it should do the job but it wasn't because we were being driven by the service providers.", "2865 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So in the end, out of this you developed a network, you created a network. And who actually owns that network now?", "2866 MR. FELL: So the ownership of the network under Infrastructure Canada Rules, 51 percent of the tangible assets funded with government funding are owned by EORN and EOWC for seven years, and then released back to the private sector.", "2867 The reality is the private sector owns, operates and maintains the network, and in exchange for the subsidy that we provided, they have ongoing service level agreements and upgrade maintenance, support and upgrade. So as the network starts to grow, they bring subscribers on to the network. They generate revenue. As the capacity starts to fill up, they have to then meet our service level obligations to continue to invest in the network over time.", "2868 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So your network is essentially a network of a lot of different technologies, fiber, copper, a conglomeration if you want to put it that way of both technology and partners. Would that be accurate?", "2869 MR. FELL: That's correct. There were three main components. You asked about the technology. There was fiber call network which we needed to support the region and grow. That was 160 PoPs. There were also last mile access projects of which a number of providers participated in that.", "2870 And then we always knew that some of the residents in the most rural remote areas would not be able to be reached by a terrestrial solution. So we negotiated a $10 million agreement with Xplornet for satellite capacity in the region.", "2871 That contract was finalized in 2011 and that satellite capacity is pretty much used up at this point and we're looking forward to the addition of new satellite capacity later this year and early next year.", "2872 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So you can see that your -- why I asked a question like this so that I could understand the decision-making process both in the past and as well as in the future and where that all comes together with respect to the decisions that you end up making.", "2873 I'm interested now in how did you make that original decision to do a 10 in 1? Can you tell me something about your process in doing 10 and 1? And why -- in your submission, you say that there -- you put out the idea that there's a need for symmetric -- symmetry in the up and down. But yet, you haven't done that yourselves.", "2874 I'm just wondering if somebody could explain that and your decision-making process because, obviously, are you the main decision-makers or you clearly have to consider your partners in it too, and your partners are the private sector. So somehow those decisions have to be balanced. Could you maybe walk us through how that happens?", "2875 MR. FELL: Okay. So it is a fine balance as you say and I think it's fair to say we've learned a lot through administering this project over the last five years. So the decisions we made in 2010 around those aspirational goals of 10 and 1 are perhaps informed by the experience on the ground that the wardens get and our staff get every day in terms of calls from citizens about the infrastructure that we built. And that's why one of our key recommendations was also about defining basic standards, not just aspirational speed goals.", "2876 So with advice from our engineers and a lot of research and consulting, that's how we identified 10 by 1 as the aspirational goal for the network and that's what our service level agreements are built around.", "2877 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Did you have input from the communities that you were -- that the network was going to serve at that time? Did you do community engagement of any kind, or was that basically a business decision that you made?", "2878 MR. EMON: Yes, we did and it was also at the local level too. Each individual council, single tier or regional council had a series of formalized and informal consultations with their communities. Industry came in to talk about their needs in terms of being just-in-time ordering and just-in-time delivery, the tourism sector and I can speak for Renfrew Country specifically.", "2879 We spoke with the education sector about their needs for distance learning, distance learning between communities within our region. So we did a -- we did undertake some consultation and then some of it, once it was announced, started to trickle in.", "2880 We heard from the hospitals about the ability to transfer imagery and what that was necessary -- what was needed for that and they had already gone out and wired themselves through a private service provider and then they\u2019ve since, I think, amalgamated into our system at the same time.", "2881 So it was a quasi-formal, informal -- and once your name gets attached to something in a small community, you\u2019re not long getting told things. And so there was a series of those meetings as well.", "2882 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Indeed I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the case.", "2883 So your decision was based on the applications and uses that you perceived would be needed by your communities at that time? And can you tell me what those would have been? You mentioned health; you mentioned education.", "2884 MR. FELL: Health, education, finance. I think the warden spoke this morning that rural banks are closing. As you drive along Highway 7 you\u2019ll notice bank branches are closing. Because of the demographics, schools in rural areas are closing. Recently about a week ago on CBC you might have seen Anna Maria Tremonti\u2019s report on The Current about automated milking systems with cows. So farmers that live in rural area, they\u2019re fairly isolated, they can automate that process. And if there\u2019s a problem they get a text on their cell phone. In order for that to work they need to have connectivity. So those are some of the examples.", "2885 MR. EMON: A more recent example for us was when the world kayak championships came to Beachburg, which is the Whitewater Region just up the Ottawa River about 70 kilometres west of here. And there wasn\u2019t enough capacity nor a tower close by and we had to bring in a portable tower to be able to broadcast it worldwide.", "2886 So we\u2019re getting on a regular basis contact from the community saying, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s great what you have, but it\u2019s just not enough.\u201d And so I think part of what we\u2019ve undertaken as the Wardens\u2019 Caucus and Eastern Ontario Regional Network has been a reassessment. And that\u2019s been part of the digital strategy as well as the discussions we\u2019re going to initiate about platform and cell coverage. Because we noticed there\u2019s a cell problem in our communities as well; there\u2019s not enough cell coverage for day-to-day activity plus for our emergency services. ", "2887 So it\u2019s growing on a life of its own. In short, the more capacity we provide, the more capacity is needed.", "2888 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. It seems to work out that way, doesn\u2019t it?", "2889 MR. EMON: Yes.", "2890 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "2891 Okay, the third point that I brought up earlier that I\u2019d like a bit of a description on, the EORN model. Can somebody explain what that is? I know we\u2019ve touched on a lot of it, but maybe just to briefly summarize and add any other points that you feel are relevant?", "2892 MR. FELL: Well, it\u2019s a private-public partnership model, which I think is fairly unique. The public sector -- there are different models that have been tried in Canada and around the world. And on the one hand, I think my board members and the wardens here today really have, as they mentioned, feet on the street; they talk to local citizens. ", "2893 At the same time, we managed all of the financing, legal, contracting, procurement, mapping, and decision-making process, as you mentioned, around targets. So our original targets were to try and get terrestrial solution for 85 percent of the population with the view that in areas where there\u2019s less than three households per square kilometre it\u2019s not likely going to be economically feasible.", "2894 So by having an organization like EORN that has both local presence and understanding of the local issues, and yet an ability to partner and offer an incentive to the private sector and do it at a very low cost, the private-public partnership model is one that we think has in our case worked very well and we would like to see it used again in the future. ", "2895 In particular, as Warden Emon mentioned, no cell companies were technology-agnostic and that was a requirement of Infrastructure Canada funding and Industry Canada as well. We couldn\u2019t say, \u201cWe want all fibre to the home or satellite.\u201d So when we issued the RFPs it was about setting aspirational targets for access speed and price. And it came back on a competitive basis. ", "2896 But the network traffic has changed significantly in five years and it\u2019s moving to mobile. And now we see a need for closing those gaps in our areas as well.", "2897 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "2898 Your submission suggests, in fact as you suggest; it says, that you think that the market forces aren\u2019t really working. It seems like when you look at the speed that you have, the type of network that you have, it seems like your coverage is quite extensive. Can you just say why you would say that he market forces don\u2019t seem to be working?", "2899 MR. FELL: I think in particular that was referring to pre-2010 and in what we see in the shift towards cell. But I\u2019d ask Reza to supplement.", "2900 MR. RAJABIUN: I don\u2019t exactly which paragraph you\u2019re referring to. It\u2019s not that market forces are not working. It\u2019s that the incentives are limited. So the role of the public sector becomes motivating and developing coordination mechanisms for the market players to become engaged in markets that they otherwise would not participate in, which was the case before EORN in Eastern Ontario, a very large part of the region.", "2901 So the way we look at it is not a conflict within public leadership and market forces. The key to the development of EORN and the way this strategy is moving forward into the future is to work with the private partners to motivate them and increase their incentives to serve our communities.", "2902 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so that brings me around to basically about the funding because you\u2019re suggesting a subsidy. And yet, if market forces are working why would there need to be some sort of a cross-subsidization?", "2903 MR. EMON: Maybe just before David answers, what I would clarify is we feel that the market traditionally, since 2007, has been driven to work. It wouldn\u2019t have worked otherwise. Previous to the formation of EORN there was no desire to do anything but cherry-pick several streets that had 50 houses on it. And for us to be able to generate enough capacity for our communities, our whole community, we had to drive them into those dark areas. And I think bluntly that\u2019s probably the best model. Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have gotten service. And I think, you know, David can probably elaborate on a little broader what that means. ", "2904 But pointedly, we don\u2019t think they would have gone into those areas. We had to drive them into those areas by showing them the need first and second the business case using the partnership model as the driver.", "2905 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: The EORN model then would be to come together as a group and then apply some pressure which helps that market along, those market forces along?", "2906 MR. FELL: Yes. And I think if you look at the economics of the cost-per-household passed when we averaged it out -- I mean, we broke the whole region up into geographic zones and we tendered those zones as a group. And we still got better coverage and a lower cost-per-household passed in the zones along Highway 7 and in more populated areas. But by coordinating the RFP process and the funding mechanism, in a way I\u2019m convinced that we got better coverage. If you look in the northern areas, the cost-per-household passed was getting up into the $10,000 to $12,000 per household passed, which is prohibitive even with 100 percent subsidy.", "2907 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. It seems like your strategy worked fairly well.", "2908 MR. FELL: We think it did.", "2909 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Within the ---", "2910 MR. RAJABIU: Sorry, may I expand on that? Just I want to simplify it.", "2911 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Of course.", "2912 MR. RAJABIU: On that point of the connection between market forces, we were talking about mobile and mobile coverage gaps. As was in our presentation, the Wardens\u2019 Caucus and EORN conducted an engineering assessment of identifying what kind of gaps exist in the mobile network in terms of both coverage and capacity.", "2913 But on top of that, we have also done a financial analysis to understand what would be the rate of return for private-sector operator to close those gaps. And those rates of returns are clearly below, way below, the reservation rates of return on investment that they can get both in urban areas and also in other ventures. ", "2914 When you\u2019re talking about the vertically-integrated operator, they have multiple opportunities for investment. So investment in a rural community\u2019s mobile network, their rate of return might be positive and sufficient for a smaller operator to enter. But since mobile markets are dominated by a few companies, they don\u2019t have that incentive to enter. ", "2915 So the subsidy and the inducements, both in terms of funds and also negotiation and coordination, are needed to increase that rate of return or bringing somebody that is willing to accept a lower rate of return than the large player that operates in very low-cost urban areas. So that\u2019s the connection between the public and the private sector.", "2916 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Tell me something about the competition with your area, within your region. ", "2917 The different providers, they obviously have to compete with each other to -- because you've got a backbone and then you've got community on top of that. So how does that work out? How is that working? ", "2918 MR. FELL: So there is competition. There was competition on the backbone. The rates on the backbone are CRTC regulated rates and there's open access on that network from -- that pops outward. ", "2919 The same model applied to the access zone, so in some of the areas we awarded contracts to multiple ISPs to cover the same zone with different technologies, so the combination of DSL and wireless.", "2920 In other zones, it was only economically feasible for one ISP that bid on the zone. We only got one response, for example, in some of the areas or the more northern remote areas, perhaps only a DSL bid on that particular zone. ", "2921 So there is competition, there is open access, and that backbone network is pushed out quite a bit further throughout the region with 160 pops.", "2922 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, and the gaps that you had identified within your research, you're planning on closing those gaps with wireless? That's the idea? ", "2923 MR. FELL: We believe that's one solution, along with continued investment in the original project through the providers and other mechanisms that might come up, but we really believe that wireless is a huge opportunity to continue to close those gaps. And they will be able to leverage the original investment in the backhaul network as well.", "2924 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I have some fairly specific sorts of questions for you now. Thank you for that broad overview.", "2925 What sort of specific applications or services do you envision that will require greater capacity, greater bandwidth? In other words, what's the difference between 10-1 and 25-3? What's going to happen in between there?", "2926 MR. FELL: Paula, do you want to --- ", "2927 MS. PRESTON: And in some of the applications that we're seeing is -- and driving some of the symmetrical stuff as well, we're looking at a lot more organizations and small businesses are trying to use work-at-home type applications. ", "2928 Medical offices, they're looking at uploading as much as they are looking at downloading information, so things like -- as we've heard about, some of the small -- we've got small medical offices in rural Ontario and it's really important for us to be able to keep doctors in these rural areas as well, is that they're looking at how do they upload images to a subject matter expert if the hospital is in Kingston? It's that sort of uploads are required for across the board in all kinds of applications. ", "2929 Other ones are, we've got some people who are doing architects working at home or in other areas. They need to upload files as well. There seems to be a ongoing demand as more and more people are moving out into a rural community and to retain people living in a rural community is this need for both sides of a symmetrical driving force. ", "2930 We're also seeing -- also driving the demand for increased speeds are the increased number of devices in homes as well. It's not -- no longer one device per household. It's multiple devices, multiple simultaneous devices per household, whether it be children at home doing work at home or schooling at home, or parents working at home or even just the whole social media aspect of -- from a connectivity point of view. ", "2931 All these are driving increased bandwidth across the piece. I mean, it's just, everywhere we look there's a new application and we're not yet predicting where these -- what these new applications are. They're just appearing. So I mean, it's just, everywhere we look there's more demand. ", "2932 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, what -- how do you see the home and the businesses? Are there similarities in the requirements of that? You mentioned that they seem to be, you know, sort of blurring, a lot of working at home and so on. Is that one of the major drivers, do you think, in this -- in between this 10-1 and that 25-3? ", "2933 MS. PRESTON: I think that's a fair assumption, that there's -- it gives us the possibility of working at home, more so than -- you know, in terms of we don\u2019t have the commute time. You know, we don\u2019t -- people aren't -- I would say yes, it is more of a blurring of work at home and residential -- like, business and residential use, yes.", "2934 MR. FELL: In particular, the example that we have in rural areas, we're trying to keep them economically viable. ", "2935 A lot of Eastern Ontario, rural Eastern Ontario, is cottage country. People come from Toronto, Ottawa, out into rural areas. We're encouraging them to stay there. ", "2936 Whether you agree with it or not, working from the cottage, if people can come up on Thursday night and stay til Monday night, they're buying gas, they're buying groceries, they're participating in the community. And it's helping keep a lot of our communities economically viable. So I think that that's another --- ", "2937 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, so symmetry would be very important then to -- in access? ", "2938 MR. EMON: And if I might add too --- ", "2939 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure. ", "2940 MR. EMON: --- when we talk about home use, that also includes a public use of your home because in some instances, we're working with our acute care paramedics to conduct home visits to people who are shut in for wound care or regular maintenance and visitations. ", "2941 And part of that, we envision, will be the transportation of their information or transmission, sorry, of their information on an on-site basis back to a doctor at a base. ", "2942 And so we are doing some things with that now where we're taking the notes and going someplace to transmit them. But I suspect most of rural Canada will shift to an acute care paramedic real-time transmission because we've got highly skilled people who go out on emergency calls and have some downtime, which we should be utilizing in the community. ", "2943 So I think you're going to see more of that as well as more home-based education opportunities. We've had some conversations with people asking about that ability to do that within the network of 10 families or 6 families, spread out over a distance. So there are some quasi-public applications for your home which will boost the need for capacity.", "2944 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: How do you see things like gaming and so on? How does that fit into it? ", "2945 Some intervenors have suggested that that's not necessarily something essential. Maybe it is to some people. What would your views be on that? ", "2946 MR. EMON: It's essential to the peace in your home, but beyond that, I'm not sure what I could offer. ", "2947 MR. FELL: That really hasn\u2019t been what's driven the Wardens' Caucus or EORN. It really has been about economic participation and continued participation in the economy, although, you know, as the warden said, it's important to some of our constituents. ", "2948 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Now, just moving on a bit here, going back to the idea of the funding, I want to sort of focus on that and your suggestion, your recommendation for a funding initiative and so on. ", "2949 How do you see the latest announcement on funding from the federal government? Did you think that that's going to help you or some comments on that? ", "2950 MR. FELL: Any funding announcements by senior levels of government are always appreciated. I think it's fair to say, as most of the submissions have mentioned this morning, it's likely not enough. ", "2951 And I would come back to the question you asked about the model. Our model suggests that the private sector will contribute in areas where it's not necessarily economically viable if other levels of government will match that. ", "2952 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. ", "2953 MR. FELL: And I think another comment about the funding was that we had to be extremely creative, as you can imagine, to get broadband in under infrastructure funding. It's not your typical infrastructure project. ", "2954 So we continue to look for creative ways to work with government and private sector to make that fit. ", "2955 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. Okay. ", "2956 MR. FELL: Any assistance the Commission can give us on doing that was always appreciated. ", "2957 MR. EMON: Yeah, we've taken the approach of trying to massage programs as they came out. And I would suggest to you the last two years, the broadband funding that was released didn\u2019t allow for the Eastern Ontario Regional Network to directly access that. ", "2958 But what we did was, we turned our expertise over to some smaller service providers and assisted them in making their applications to fill some of the gaps. ", "2959 So we've tried to evolve our model to service our communities, based on the financing coming out. But a direct answer to your question, at this point we don\u2019t know what the criteria is. Ideally, it would be, you know, we'd love to shape it around our box and then export our model to other people, as you\u2019ve noted. ", "2960 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. What about with Xplornet? Do you think that that's going to help out, with Xplornet, the funding for Xplornet? ", "2961 Okay, we\u2019ll just move that. We\u2019ll just move on past that.", "2962 So you gave us a bit of an idea of what your past experiences were with different funding regimes and so on and your creativity in that sense too. Now, if we were to decide that a broadband funding program is necessary, based on your experiences with the past funding regimes, both your own experiences as well as what you know and your viewpoint, what elements or principles of existing or previous programs do you see as being more beneficial or effective and why?", "2963 MR. FELL: So I think one of the things we\u2019ve advocated for in our submission is that public-private partnerships are a key aspect of that. Prior to our submission it wasn\u2019t a mandatory requirement for federal funding. We chose to develop that governance model and submit and I think it worked fairly well. I believe subsequently for federal funding over $50 million PPPs are a required component of it.", "2964 I also think having some connection to community-based organizations rather than just giving it directly to the private sector companies to administer -- the warden referred to Canada 150. Our mapping and our assessments at a very granular level of where the gaps are I think is much better and much more realistic in terms of where the priority areas are and helping to allocate some of those scarce dollars.", "2965 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Remember I asked you to give us some guiding principles which you would consider to be guiding principles for us?", "2966 MR. FELL: For the CRTC?", "2967 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "2968 MR. FELL: Reza?", "2969 MR. RAJABIUN: I think the EORN experience in terms of structure of the model follows from the discussions that we\u2019ve heard in the past day and a half. ", "2970 The backhaul infrastructure is very important to have for rural areas. And some of the newer programs from the federal government, they have just been focusing on last mile subsidies, and those last mile subsidies providing them directly to the service providers rather than going through a public intermediary. I think there was a terminology used yesterday about community intermediaries.", "2971 So when you are not balancing backbone and last mile subsidies and you\u2019re just going to the last mile subsidies, then that capacity is going to run out very fast. So that\u2019s almost like throwing the money away.", "2972 But if you are focusing totally on the backhaul facilities, then you run into the problems that have been brought up about the Alberta SuperNET. And its backhaul capacity being there, but since the incumbent was not involved in that project, basically not allowing the operators to connect from the local communities through the Alberta SuperNET.", "2973 So the key, I guess, lesson from a technical perspective and a design perspective, is managing those two components to maximize the impact of their scarce funds that you have.", "2974 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so balancing the two components, the backhaul and the last mile.", "2975 MR. FELL: And if I could be very specific with an example?", "2976 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure.", "2977 MR. FELL: The county of Peterborough back from 2006 to 2009, all of the municipalities were competing for different funding programs for last mile access funding. They spent about $7 million on last mile, putting up towers, supporting smaller ISPs. And yet, those towers didn\u2019t have enough backhaul to connect to so they were constantly filling up with capacity as fast as they could put them up.", "2978 With EORN, their proportion it shares was around $700,000 or $800,000 or 10 percent. They got a $12 million investment into Peterborough County. They now have three providers with a number of points of presence with enough backhaul, DSL, wireless. ", "2979 So I think that that\u2019s an economic example of working together regionally as another principle that I think we would really advocate for. Instead of forcing small municipalities to compete against each other, encourage them to work together.", "2980 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So yeah, that\u2019s an interesting take on it.", "2981 Should that be a guiding principle for us as well, how remote the communities are? Again, I\u2019m asking for suggestions for guiding principles for us, what you would suggest.", "2982 MR. EMON: I\u2019m not sure how to define this, but I would broadly define it as liveability. I think if it\u2019s a means of making the environment easier for people to reside and to work in the area -- and I think if it could be driven by research which shows the gaps and then also the service needs, and go across to some of the community services like paramedicine and like visiting homemakers and things like that as well, I think it has to be a total package because your whole community has to buy into it. We all like the fact that we can order something from somewhere and it gets delivered by UPS the next morning or two days later; that\u2019s great. But at the same time, I think, you know, as we get a little older, and our demographics show that our community is getting older, that we want to feel safe at home.", "2983 So I think it has to be a total community view of what\u2019s good for your community as an overriding principle. And it shouldn\u2019t centre solely on economic. That data maybe should be 80 percent of what you do, but there should be 20 percent or something like that to talk about the benefit to the community.", "2984 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. And in your viewpoint that should be based on evidence, research?", "2985 MR. EMON: Yes, I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s been primarily the reason why the Eastern Ontario Warden\u2019s Caucus and the Eastern Ontario Regional Network have been successful, is we\u2019ve been able to go out and actually show you a map and point to the specific hexagon that says, \u201cThere is no service here; there\u2019s limited service\u201d and even talk to the standards of the existing equipment. And I think that\u2019s necessary. I think you have to have a very good ground game and be able to produce information to show this makes sense to put it in here because of these reasons.", "2986 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "2987 MR. FELL: This morning one of the requests was around digital literacy or supporting digital literacy. I think if you look at the digital strategy that we put together, we\u2019ve shown that the Eastern Ontario Regional Network started off as primarily an infrastructure project. But they\u2019ve evolved that into a digital strategy that includes both supply and demand and encouraging digital participation in the economy. The more we work in the area, the more we see the need to work on the demand side as well to help rural citizens, municipalities, businesses take advantage of the capacity that we can provide.", "2988 MR. JONES: If I could add as well, it also has a domino effect in other ways. In my particular municipality we have a tourist area, Stony Lake, and it certainly has really been obvious that people can spend more time now on their weekends. They can come up Thursday or Friday and they don\u2019t mind doing that; they can still run their businesses from Toronto or Ottawa or Montreal. And it just made a huge impact in economic development. It just has changed the whole flavour of everyday life in the summertime.", "2989 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Thank you for that.", "2990 Let me see. Another question I have for you, could you please share your views on the difference between low-density rural and remote areas compared to high-density urban areas in terms of choice of providers and the impact that that has had on your communities?", "2991 MR. FELL: Sorry, could you clarify, ", "2992 \u201cin terms of choice of providers\u201d? Competition, is that specifically what you\u2019re ---", "2993 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, one of these things that we\u2019re interested in here is we want to explore the difference between the low-density rural and remote areas compared to high-density urban areas in terms of choice, more choice, less choice, do you have to try and stimulate that. Could you give me some comments on that?", "2994 MR. FELL: Okay. I\u2019m going to ask Paula to respond to that.", "2995 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Some of these specific sort of questions I ask of you are to create a fulsome record for us.", "2996 MS. PRESTON: I think one of the things that we\u2019re finding is that even after we\u2019ve done this first phase of our project, in the areas that we\u2019ve gone into there are two choices now. Before there was none; now we have two choices and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s either Bell DSL and satellite or it\u2019s a wireless provider and satellite. I mean, we just do not have choice in the rural areas. And for people who are unhappy with their service levels, they have no choice. It\u2019s keep it or drop everything; you don\u2019t have any service.", "2997 So choice is a key issue. We do not have choice in rural areas even with the successful program like ours.", "2998 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "2999 MR. FELL: And I think that\u2019s why one of our other recommendations or suggestions to the Commission is around minimum service levels around adopting those nationally. If you pay for a 10 by 1 package, a certain percentage of the time you should likely get that; that\u2019s what you\u2019re paying for. And technologically we -- technically we know that that\u2019s possible.", "3000 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Okay, now, in your submission you talk about, you know, getting a forward-looking viewpoint, and you\u2019ve mentioned it also that we should to the future -- you should look -- we should all look to the future in terms of what\u2019s going to happen, which nobody really knows, and how you will deal with that and how we will deal with that.", "3001 So you suggested -- you suggested a cross-subsidization. Can you expand on that for us in ---", "3002 MR. RAJABIUN: The future in general or cross-subsidy model, which one would you like to discuss ---", "3003 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so who ---", "3004 MR. RAJABIUN: --- since it\u2019s separate, I guess?", "3005 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- should pay and who should get the money? And who should pay?", "3006 MR. RAJABIUN: Well, the customers will always pay at the end. So starting from that -- but that\u2019s at the end. ", "3007 So in the beginning there is two options; one is ad-hoc funding from the federal government, which has been the policy for the past 10, 15 years, and the second option, which is before you today, is to develop a sustainable funding model that can help rural communities across the country, including us, to address the challenges that the communities are bringing up to the representatives and are concerned about.", "3008 So in the very long-term future, everybody knows that copper and cable wires are going to deteriorate and fibre is going to be -- has to come in so -- in 50 years, potentially. In urban areas in Canada, the incentives to deploy fibre have been pretty negligible, almost zero outside of Atlantic Canada. But maybe given your policy change over the wholesale decision last year, it seems like that has had a stimulating effect on the incentives of the operators to invest in fibre networks or at least announce that they will at some point in the future invest in FTTP in urban areas.", "3009 But in rural areas, that is the likelihood that there will be any investment in next-generation fibre networks that will have to replace the copper -- aging copper infrastructure, some of it which was deployed before World War II, is pretty close to zero. ", "3010 So there should not be an assumption that market forces will solve this issue. And this connects back to the -- and it\u2019s not just a very long-term problem. It connects to the short-term problem of dealing with phone -- with the existing basic service obligations for telephony. In the rural communities that are relying on the copper networks for the phone, that -- for phone connectivity, that -- the quality of service and voice is going down. That is going to have to be replace with fibre at some point in the future.", "3011 So I guess the question before you is what kind of funding model will be developed that can accelerate that transition from where we are right now to where we\u2019ll be in 50 years. So I guess it\u2019s a question of short versus long-term objectives of the policy makers.", "3012 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. What\u2019s your viewpoint on that? How does EORN see it?", "3013 MR. RAJABIUN: I\u2019m sorry?", "3014 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: How does EORN see it? What -- who should pay and who should receive?", "3015 MR. RAJABIUN: Well, the customers will pay at the end.", "3016 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "3017 MR. RAJABIUN: In the beginning for the capital expenditures, if private service providers would be willing to invest in certain areas, that\u2019s their optimal option, so scarce public resources can go into potentially more important things.", "3018 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "3019 MR. RAJABIUN: But if they are not -- and we know that the incentives to invest in mobile -- in closing the mobile gaps or fibre networks -- FTTP networks of the future are going to be pretty close to zero. So we either have to wait for 10 years -- if you don\u2019t adopt a sustainable funding mechanism, we\u2019ll have to wait another 10 years until the copper loops start to deteriorate and then go back and look for funding from the government to try to motivate the private sector to come in and fill those gaps.", "3020 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "3021 MR. RAJABIUN: So without inducements, it\u2019s not going to happen.", "3022 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. But in your submission you\u2019re pretty clear on the fact that it\u2019s the lower levels of government that should be in control of whatever funding mechanism might come in to place. ", "3023 MR. FELL: We\u2019re definitely suggesting that municipal governments have a role in that -- a role in contributing, but more importantly in some of the decision-making that you talked about in the beginning of knowing where those priorities are and knowing -- again, a lot of this was driven by economic development research.", "3024 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "3025 MR. FELL: Where are the areas around agriculture, food, tourism, manufacturing that need -- as well as businesses and residents that are going to need this to support either sustaining those communities or growing those communities.", "3026 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. But in terms of if the -- if the funding ends up in the hands of, as you suggest -- it ends up in the hands of the lower levels of government who are much more on -- have their hands on the pulse -- their finger on the pulse of their communities, where do you see this money coming from? Does it come from all of the -- all of the providers? You know, it has to come from somewhere and I didn\u2019t really pick up in your submission where you would perceive that it would come from. I can see quite clearly where it would go but I don\u2019t see where it would come from.", "3027 MR. FELL: Sorry, I think I understand the question better now.", "3028 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, okay.", "3029 MR. FELL: So I think we\u2019re suggesting a continues approach to the one that we\u2019ve used with EORN where there\u2019s combined federal and provincial funding along with private sector funding through regional municipal entities that can help make that -- those decisions and allocate the funding on an as-needed basis.", "3030 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I don\u2019t think I have any more questions for you. Thank you very much.", "3031 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar.", "3032 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. And you answered, I think, my question. I just want to make sure I understand well here. ", "3033 My question really was what sort of funding mechanism you were speaking of when you wanted to develop a sustainable industry-funded cross-subsidy mechanism. So did I just hear you say that you would see the funding mechanism being basically a continuation of what has been existing in the past, or you\u2019re looking for something else?", "3034 MR. FELL: I think we\u2019re advocating for a combined federal, provincial, and private sector funding mechanism that would be available for application and distribution through a municipal -- regional/municipal entities.", "3035 It\u2019s not exactly the way it was -- I mean it is the way we applied for it in the past but I think we talked about having to creatively make that fit within Infrastructure Canada funding. I think if the Commission could help clarify those kind of PPP funding mechanisms, that would be appreciated.", "3036 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. So you\u2019re not looking for us to establish an industry-funded mechanism; you would look to us for some kind of guidance or direction to seek to coordinate funding or what?", "3037 MR. RAJABIUN: No, we were looking for an industry-funded mechanism. The ad-hoc infrastructure funds are not sufficient. I\u2019m going back to the question that you discussed about, what do you think of the new funding announcements from the federal government? It -- I think it was 500 million. That\u2019s two or three projects around the country and regional projects will eat that up. ", "3038 So the question is, what is the degree of commitment by the CRTC to developing a funding mechanism that -- cross-subsidies means you have the low-cost urban areas, and you have the high-cost rural areas. So at some level we will -- you will have to -- if industry funding mechanism is going to be developed, industry funding means that there has to be some sort of mandate to generate those funds to be able to stimulate the industry again.", "3039 The industry, without a CRTC mandate that generates a certain cash flow into the future that is distributable to the rural communities, will not by itself fill those gaps. ", "3040 And I think in our response to both CRTC and -- to interrogatories by both CRTC and Rogers, we didn\u2019t really go through the detail in our original submission; we tried to present you with what we\u2019ve done mostly and what our objectives are. But we had questions from CRTC and from Rogers in terms interrogatories and we actually go through the detail of why both on the input side of the funding mechanism, how you generate funds; we proposed that only the larger operators that dominate Canada\u2019s urban markets should be subject to the funding mechanism -- to the funding mandate. ", "3041 That's a very important point, I think. A bunch of discussions that have come out because right now the threshold is $10 million for inclusion in the existing basic subsidy, I believe. Maybe I am incorrect on this, $10 million of revenues of the company. That kind of funding mechanism has a real -- has disincentivized smaller operators like SSi that we saw today.", "3042 And in terms of compensation how much money you can raise by having such a low threshold, the value added is almost zero.", "3043 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Maybe ask a question, and this is maybe what has confused me a little bit.", "3044 I understand well the cross-subsidy mechanisms between urban and rural areas, between high cost and lost cost areas. We have done it on the voice side for a long time in an industry-funded mechanism.", "3045 But you folks are successful. I think you can be proud of what you have achieved. You have looked at the needs of your communities. You have collected yourselves. You have addressed the economic and social requirements of your communities but came together with an innovative P3 project to make that happen and decided that the targets that were in place on a national basis were not sufficient to meet your needs and so you have gone forward.", "3046 And so what confuses me a bit is why you would now come and say, you know, \"Let's establish national standards and put in place this cross-funding mechanism which would essentially take it out of your hands\". So are you comfortable that that might be an outcome of this that we establish standards?", "3047 We established an aspirational target last time and you looked at your communities and said that wasn't sufficient, wasn't going to meet the needs of our -- to you know enhance our communities, to address the industries that existed there. You set your own and you went and sought funding.", "3048 So if we -- it appears that you are saying here that -- you know establish standards and establish a mechanism. Well, if we do that you no longer have control of the telecommunications investment decisions in your communities. Are you comfortable with that outcome?", "3049 MR. RAJABIUN: Why wouldn't we have the control? That's the whole proposal.", "3050 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, that's your proposal but that's certainly not the way that the funds that exist today work.", "3051 MR. RAJABIUN: Exactly.", "3052 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So I am just asking you if you are not control of that are you still comfortable with that outcome? Are you comfortable with there being a national target? I mean it was set last time. You didn't like it and you went and created your own, and good for you by the way.", "3053 MR. RAJABIUN: You are the only party with the legal authority and responsibility to do so.", "3054 There is two answers to your question about why we are here. First, is that despite you may think that you are successful and apparently compared to a lot of communities across the country that have been totally left behind, we are.", "3055 But the reason for that is that we are looking forward into the future. We are realizing that if we don't do something now about the fibre and you don't develop it as a sustainable funding mechanism, that that cross-subsidizes from urban to rural areas in terms of fibre. We are not going to have it any time in the future. So that's one aspect of it.", "3056 And the second aspect of it is basically these models that are successful can be replicated. So it's not -- the question that you are bringing up about loss of control is a clear possibility that if you develop a new mechanism that it basically collects the funds and just gives it back to the incumbents maybe that's not going to work out so well, so that becomes a political decision whether we support it or not.", "3057 And I don't want to comment on that but the results -- we will know what -- from an economic perspective you know what the results will be.", "3058 MR. FELL: I don't know that we drew the same conclusion from the recommendations that we put in. I think that our view ---", "3059 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I understand you're looking for sources of funding and looking for sustainable sources of funding. And fair enough, you know, to come in front of us.", "3060 I am just asking if you have considered all the consequences. I mean there have been sources of funding since the internet emerged and it has done wonderful things for this nation. I mean there is gaps but I don't -- frankly, I don't know why we are viewed as to being the sole source of funding. We have not been in the past.", "3061 MR. RAJABIUN: You have the responsibility under the Telecom Act if you want -- if you define a -- if you go on to define the service to be basic then you can just define it and say this is a basic service. The key becomes the implementation and how effective we are to implement that legal mandate", "3062 So just having a formal announcement after this proceeding that we have decided to redefine broadband, recognized that it's a basic service that's really not going to help anybody. The key is going to be what kind of mechanism you develop following that in order to be able to deliver to us and various other communities where there is a recognition and there is -- the facts on the ground show you that market incentives are not going to be strong and therefore support is required to motivate private sector operators to serve our communities.", "3063 MR. EMON: And if I might add, the short answer to your question about losing local control, no, we wouldn't be in favour of that. We would hope that you would sculpt your response to recognize the value of having local -- either local control or local direction.", "3064 And, secondly, I can assure you that we are quite comfortable with a nearly constant audit process during the last iteration of funding that we have gone through since 2010. So I would think that would also be part of -- part of, you know, respectfully part of your decision-making would be the local control with a series of audits to ensure that either regional goals are set and met or maybe you know quarter provincial goals or something so that, I think, you know, local -- I think the local input and the local control because of the ability to recognize the needs of the community almost instantaneously is important to the success of a model such as this.", "3065 THE CHAIRPERSON: Maybe I would just like to follow up on the conversation you had about perhaps not having any use to declaring a basic service.", "3066 I understand the point that to use our cross-subsidy model existing you have to first declare it to be a basic service. But I don\u2019t understand why you would think that it's completely not useful to declare something to be a basic service because certainly it would have an influence on others who might have funding mechanisms other than the existing one. Would you agree with that?", "3067 MR. RAJABIUN: Yes, I stand corrected ---", "3068 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "3069 MR. RAJABIUN: --- on that point.", "3070 THE CHAIRPERSON: So it may be not going as far as you would want but it does go further than the status quo.", "3071 MR. RAJABIUN: Yeah, and actually I'll come back a little more on that just by correcting it to the speed discussions that we have been having and the quality of service guarantees versus aspirational standards. You could define broadband as we are asking both fixed and mobile to be technologically neutral. You can define them as a basic service and not develop a funding mechanism but those -- so two options are if you don't -- if you don't develop a funding mechanism.", "3072 So there is -- two options remain on the table. We either keep the existing regime under the 2011 framework where there is just aspirational targets that we hope will be achieved at some point, versus a system that you define what is a minimum basic level of service which every operator has to guarantee to whoever demands it and then market forces can set prices and quality besides for that. So you create a focal point in the market ---", "3073 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "3074 MR. RAJABIUN: --- for the basic service.", "3075 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, so the BSO declaration is a threshold question to many follow-up issues.", "3076 MR. RAJABIUN: Yes.", "3077 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, just some follow-up questions on paragraph 44. You have said here, and I realize it's 2014 numbers. I just want to understand exactly what you are saying here.", "3078 You are saying that 90 percent of the region in 2014 or more than, let's say 90 percent, delivered speed of 10 and 1. So are you -- I'm trying to figure out what -- 90 percent of what? Is it 90 percent of the projects you were involved in or is it the entire region whether you were involved or not?", "3079 MR. FELL: Ninety percent of the households that we counted in our mapping have access to a 10 by 1 terrestrial solution.", "3080 THE CHAIRPERSON: Terrestrial?", "3081 MR. FELL: Terrestrial solution. The rest of them have -- the other 10 percent have access to a satellite solution up to --", "3082 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "3083 MR. FELL: -- 10 by 1, but those satellite beams are almost all full now.", "3084 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right and it\u2019s residential of any type? Because I took it -- your point is that your mission is an economic one? ", "3085 So you\u2019re focusing on obviously small businesses, farms, agricultural business, tourism and home businesses that might be in a residence.", "3086 So is your 90 percent all residences, whether or not there\u2019s a business in it?", "3087 MR. FELL: Of all households.", "3088 THE CHAIRPERSON: All households? ", "3089 MR. FELL: Yes. ", "3090 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, good.", "3091 And you\u2019re obviously at the wholesale level then at the retail level. The functionalities of various -- because you\u2019ve got both DSL and sort of satellite, Xplornet type services. ", "3092 Do you get any feedback from the people in the region as to their experience from a quality, capacity, speed or do you get any echoes of that? I can\u2019t imagine a local politician wouldn\u2019t hear about that.", "3093 MR. FELL: Thank you for that question, Mr. Chair. ", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "3094 MR. FELL: Yes we do get a significant amount of feedback from citizens and businesses. A lot of it depends on the technology, as you can imagine. ", "3095 One of the things that in your -- I believe in your EKOS research that was done, it didn\u2019t include wireless. ", "3096 So different technologies, Fibre to the home tends to provide a better quality of experience, satellite has latency, so we do get a lot of feedback.", "3097 And in some of the most hard to reach areas, where we did build out services as fast as we can build it, it\u2019s being consumed and the providers are now investing their money to increase that.", "3098 But it\u2019s not fast enough always for the citizens that are using that service. And that\u2019s why we were also advocating for some kind of minimum national standards.", "3099 We did the best that we could in terms of negotiating those with the private sector in 2010. As I mentioned we\u2019ve learned a lot over the last five years. ", "3100 As we go forward I think we might incorporate some of those learnings and take that into contracting going forward.", "3101 MR. EMON: If I might add, some of the -- if I can leave two words with you, some of the comments are both profound and profane about --", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "3102 MR. EMON: -- about access and capacity, so I -- I\u2019ll just leave that with you.", "3103 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "3104 MR. EMON: And some of it is quite laudatory as well. ", "3105 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right and in terms of lessons learned, what would be your top three next time you negotiate these things in terms of quality? Or the nature of the capacity or whatever, price, what -- the top three?", "3106 MR. FELL: One of the top three lessons learned and one of my colleagues mentioned it to me, you were asking about recommendations, was to have some flexibility in the funding envelopes. ", "3107 When we started off we had a large envelope and we were trying to envision five years out. We set some aspirational goals for coverage and capacity, speed and price.", "3108 One of the things we didn\u2019t anticipate in 2010 was being able to put high speed fibre into 56 business parks around Eastern Ontario.", "3109 We were able to do that because of some of the efficiencies we realized in the contracting process.", "3110 So was that in the contracting that we did between the federal and provincial government? Initially it wasn\u2019t envisioned. ", "3111 We were able to flex that and allow that to happen and that really made a difference. ", "3112 So flexibility of the funding envelope, always try to be more aspirational than what you can even anticipate now. ", "3113 Netflix in Canada didn\u2019t exist in 2010 when we started and now, as you know, in many of the areas, many of the most hard to reach areas, again, as fast as we can put those towers up and position the radios, LTE service 25/1 people are consuming it and it\u2019s filling up and it require more investment.", "3114 Do any of the other Wardens want to add?", "3115 MR. EMON: One of the things that I\u2019d forgotten to mention as a partner, is we had partnered with the First Nations in our communities well and consulted with them frequently and still do.", "3116 And they have a -- I think a regular presence with many of our board members and board meetings as well. ", "3117 So I -- and my apologies, I\u2019d forgotten to mention that in my introduction. It was hidden in there and I hadn\u2019t brought it up.", "3118 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, I appreciate it. ", "3119 I only heard two lessons learned and then a mention of the Aboriginal -- I mean that\u2019s a given. So what\u2019s your third lesson?", "3120 MR. FELL: Yes, thank you. ", "3121 So the original funding envelope from infrastructure Canada is structured in a 1/3-2/3, and the literal interpretation of that was every single piece had to be 1/3-2/3 funded.", "3122 When you go through a public RFP process and you\u2019re trying to encourage competition, some of the subsidies were down around the 10-20 percent level, some were at the 99 percent level.", "3123 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "3124 MR. FELL: And that flexibility over time around the allocation at the end of the day we hit the 1/3-2/3 and we got that private sector investment and that was a -- that was really key to making it work. ", "3125 When we first started implementing it the senior levels of government weren\u2019t sure that was the appropriate interpretation of that rule and that really helped.", "3126 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, good. Thank you very much for that. Those are our -- oh, was there a question from legal as it turns out? No? Okay. ", "3127 So thank you. You\u2019re a big panel and there\u2019s another larger panel so we\u2019ll take a short break until 3:10 and continue the 2 last intervenors.

Please introduce yourself and your colleagues and you have 10 minutes.", "PRESENTATION ", "3130 MR. ALEXANDER: (Speaking in Aboriginal language) ", "3131 Good afternoon. We really appreciate this opportunity to talk to you today with respect to Nunavut.

", "3135 Mr. Chairman, we have no new exhibits or attachments. However, today\u2019s submission is heavily footnoted with references that are not referred to in our filed intervention, all in the public domain and all in support of our previously stated positions.

And in the interest of time we will be hitting the highlights of our written submission.", "3139 So on page 1: Nunavut, our land. Nunavut is unique. On pages 1 and 2, you\u2019ll see illustrations of how different we really are. ", "3140 We\u2019re one fifth of Canada\u2019s land mass, 86 percent Inuit. All satellite served. We have the highest cost of living. ", "3141 If you turn to page 3, you will see a recent screenshot from CBC. I\u2019d like to draw your attention to 60 percent of Nunavut children are living in food insecure households. ", "3142 Given your recent comments about believing the CBC, Mr. Chairman, I should add that we did not have time to source the University of Toronto\u2019s study referred to in the headline, however, we undertake -- we would undertake to do so.", "3143 And at the top of page 4, demographically you will see that we are completely different from the rest of Canada. We are young and the youngest cohort is growing the fastest. ", "3144 To categorize Nunavut with other rural and remote regions in Canada is misleading. Nunavut is not like those, because Nunavut is isolated. ", "3145 Residents of the territory have to access their home communities by air. All communities in Nunavut are what the Commission refers to as satellite dependent communities. As a result, Nunavut faces unique political, and social, and economic challenges.", "3146 Comparisons are often made, that small rural communities in Southern Canada with broadband services similar to Nunavut, with the point being that their speeds are acceptable in those communities. ", "3147 This is not a fair comparison, because residents of those communities can drive to the nearest town. ", "3148 As Commissioner Menzies pointed out yesterday, driving an hour north out of Ottawa brings you to a remote location.", "3149 So people from that town can drive an hour and be in Ottawa, whereas a family from Nunavut could take anywhere from $10 to $20,000 to get to an urban centre. ", "3150 Another difference is fixed satellite services are more available in rural Southern Canada, due to higher volume of available satellites covering Southern Canada. ", "3151 You have heard how much more expensive it is to supply broadband to satellite dependent served communities. ", "3152 You must understand that our communities are underserved and overcharged in every other goods and service as well, therefore, the impact of the digital divide is more significant in Nunavut.", "3153 MR. MANOLL: Thank you, Nate.", "3154 In 2015 Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation collected data on actual download and upload speeds and Nunavut\u2019s speeds are one-twentieth the rest of Canada. As an example, to upgrade from Windows 8.1 to 10, in Ottawa that would typically take about 20 minutes; in Nunavut, greater than 10 hours and use up most of your monthly data allowance. Simply, that would not be acceptable to most Canadians.", "3155 In Nunavut, recently in the CRTC-funded SamKnows Survey, an analysis of broadband performance in Canada, the entire jurisdiction of Nunavut was excluded. Yes, the report does clarify that no satellite-served communities were included, but not why they were excluded.", "3156 We all know that research drives policy. But how can there be good policy in Nunavut if we are excluded from the research?", "3157 We ask that you reject the assumption that Nunavut is an acceptable anomaly. Nunavut as a territory cannot function properly if the government does not have decent broadband. ", "3158 And the gap is widening. On page 6 you have two graphs. Note the unusual flat steps in the Nunavut usage graph. This is the direct result of data caps. Data caps are enforced by overage charges, which are typically $15 per gigabyte per month. A family of four can typically have monthly overage charges in the hundreds of dollars so families limit usage.", "3159 Each line on the graph represents what the data cap was at that time. There is no ramp-up period. As soon as the data cap is increased, it is used up instantaneously.", "3160 The data cap, data usage, and download speeds are all the same graph. In the context of the gap illustrated in the graphs between Nunavut and Canada, it is important to consider these recent statistics on the Nunavut demographics.", "3161 Nunavut high school graduation rate is the lowest in Canada at 57 percent. The next lowest is the Northwest Territories at 81 percent. And recently, Statistics Canada advised that 35 percent of Canadians have good problem-solving and information and communication technology skills. But only 12 percent in Nunavut.", "3162 Today, computer literacy, information retrieval, and problem-solving skills are all linked and the tools for problem-solving require more and more bandwidth. The gap must be addressed.", "3163 MR. BOWLER: Affordance Broadband equals access to resources and opportunities. As numerous Canadian stakeholders have identified and documented, the internet is an essential service. Considering our isolation, broadband may be the best possible way to address vital socioeconomic development in Nunavut. ", "3164 Connectivity can be a great equalizer for Aboriginal Canadians, particularly in isolated regions such as Nunavut. Some projects currently underway have demonstrated the value of connectivity, particularly interactive education or remote learning pilot projects.", "3165 A strong majority of students who participated in these projects reported that lessons were more interesting, more enjoyable, and that they learned more. Considering that Nunavut\u2019s dropout rate is almost five times the national average, anything that makes school more enjoyable has exciting potential.", "3166 On the basic service objective, clearly the market had not provided modern broadband to isolated areas, and Nunavut falls further and further behind. Broadband must be part of the basic service objective. That change can help provide services in Nunavut that would be closer to the Canadian standard.", "3167 The BSO standard we are asking for is 9 down and 1.5 up by 2019, measured in actual speeds, not peaks. Those standards are justified in the NCIS \u201cNorthern Connectivity Report\u201d.", "3168 Updating infrastructure to those standards in Nunavut will require large infrastructure builds. Canada has a history of making ambitious investments as far back as the Transcontinental Rail link in the 19th century. In the 21st century, we now need a north to south telecommunications link. ", "3169 Federal funding is available for new infrastructure, which could reduce the impacts of isolation in the north. To help Nunavut benefit from that federal funding, the CRTC must include broadband within the basic service objective.", "3170 With respect to subsidy structure and funding models, the NCF subsidy is not addressing the gap, nor do other federal programs support large, new infrastructure builds. But that is what is required in Nunavut. There should be support for new infrastructure builds, an affordable broadband contribution fund.", "3171 The EKOS report found that better broadband for isolated areas is something Canadians support.", "3172 The new structure also needs to address all pricing, not just residential service. At present, the Government of Nunavut pays about 60 times more per megabit per second than an Ottawa-based business. Nunavut businesses face similar or worse circumstances relative to the Government of Nunavut.", "3173 Finally, we would like to stress that any change to the BSO, contribution programs, or subsidy regime, or any new framework should be designed so as not to created or promote a monopoly or oligopoly.", "3174 MR. ALEXANDER: In summary, nowhere is the digital divide more significant than in Nunavut. We are asking the following three items from you to close the gap.", "3175 One, require as a matter of policy that Commission-funded studies that are designed to measure the Canadian telecom experience must include Nunavut.", "3176 Two, include broadband as part of the basic service objective, a 2019 target BSO of 9 down and 1.5 up, which includes Nunavut, in actual speeds.", "3177 And three, to establish a fund to support infrastructure to isolated or satellite-dependent areas.", "3178 Thank you. Qujannamiik. And we are open to questions.", "3179 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.", "3180 For the record I\u2019ll mention that I think we understand the particular challenge that the territory of Nunavut faces. And so I would like more to focus our time here today on concrete solutions that we might be able to look at.", "3181 Is your proposal for 9 down and 1.5 up a national target or one you\u2019re suggesting should be appropriate for Nunavut?", "3182 MS. HOLLIS: We really can\u2019t speak for the rest of Canada.", "3183 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So implicit, therefore, at least for Nunavut since I guess you don\u2019t want to speak for the other ones, that this is the right target. Is it foreseeable or feasible in your view to have a target that maybe focuses more where the problems are and leaving market forces operate elsewhere?", "3184 MS. HOLLIS: If by where the problems are you include all of Nunavut?", "3185 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "3186 MS. HOLLIS: Okay.", "3187 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah. So we could have a different basic service BSO in different parts of the country?", "3188 MS. HOLLIS: There are a lot of places in Canada that have Nunavut\u2019s problems. The difference is their government isn\u2019t there. But to the extent that there is government there like in KRG or in the self-governed First Nations in the north of the western provinces, again I don\u2019t want to speak for them, but it would make sense that the same applied, yes.", "3189 THE CHAIRPERSON: How did you come to conclude that 9 and 1.5 -- well, let\u2019s start with just 9 for first; I\u2019ll get to 1.5 in a second -- was the appropriate speed target?", "3190 MR. ALEXANDER: Sure. The Government of Nunavut participated with the Northern Communications Information Systems Working Group that is both federal and territorial governments jointly collaborating. And this report was commissioned called the \u201cNorthern Connectivity Report\u201d, which involved building out the rationale for why speeds of 9 down were required. In the report it specifically focuses around administration, education, health, justice, public safety, as well as social services and residential access. ", "3191 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Is it your understanding that they, in their methodology, looked at the likely number of concurrent users in a residence, the likely concurrent types of applications that the service is being used and, therefore, extrapolated that the amount that one would need would be in that range?", "3192 MR. ALEXANDER: At the time, it was specifically across all jurisdictions that the NCIS group were working, so not just Nunavut but also focussing on Northwest Territories and Yukon and all services in order to provide that level of service. The extrapolation, I don\u2019t know if it was specific to density of household but it was looked at a pan-territorial design.", "3193 THE CHAIRPERSON: Is there a specificity -- because I take it that that's the methodology you're accepting. It is an appropriate methodology in your submission.", "3194 MR. ALEXANDER: Yes.", "3195 THE CHAIRPERSON: Is there anything specific to the Nunavut experience that would make that number not quite appropriate compared to the Yukon or NWT?", "3196 MS. HOLLIS: Almost everything. For example, I mean it was very interesting listening to the last group, the Eastern Ontario group. You know, their problem is keeping their aging community alive by inducing urbanites to come out with symmetrical service. We wish we had that problem.", "3197 So that's almost an unanswerable question. Everything about the north, well particularly the satellite-served areas of the north, are so different.", "3198 THE CHAIRPERSON: I appreciate that but I'm talking here we said -- I thought I understood that the 9 and 1.5 standard that you're proposing comes from a northern working group, which would have included the two other territories.", "3199 MR. ALEXANDER: Yes, it did.", "3200 THE CHAIRPERSON: Are you prepared to accept that the facts relevant to those two other territories, setting aside the satellite-delivered dominance -- I realize that -- that the social demographic realities of Nunavut are similar and therefore we should be taking that number as an appropriate number? For instance, are the household sizes different in Nunavut than, for instance, in Yukon?", "3201 MS. BABSTOCK: Mr. Blais, so in Nunavut, yes, we do have larger households. The average typical Canadian family is often stipulated as like a mom and a dad and two kids. Up north, it's often a mom and a dad and it could be, you know, four to six and sometimes relatives are living there as well. We have overcrowding as you know.", "3202 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm trying to compare between territories, not between north south. I realize that you're proposing a number that was developed as a northern number. I want to see is there any specificity about Nunavut compared to your other colleagues?", "3203 MS. HOLLIS: Part of the problem, the Government of Nunavut lacks a great deal of capacity and one of the things is the ability to answer this sort of question in a sophisticated way. We simply don\u2019t have the capacity to compare. We don\u2019t know enough about the Yukon. We have to rely on the NCIS report. I'm sorry, we just -- we are not in a position to comment on -- to make that kind of comparative economic analysis.", "3204 THE CHAIRPERSON: The problem we may lead down therefore is when you're asking us to solve a problem, we may be solving a problem on facts that aren't relevant to your territory. That's the issue and I would have thought that the Government of Nunavut who considers this a key priority would have put resources to come to this hearing which is key to social and economic, more than airfare for people to travel here, to actually bring us strong evidence so we can help out and understand the issue in the territory.", "3205 MS. HOLLIS: We accept the NCIS conclusions and the conclusions of that report. The people from the Yukon will probably beat us up afterwards if we say that. I mean, they don\u2019t want 9 and 1.5. They want more. If you want us to tell you that they shouldn\u2019t have more, it's not going to be ---", "3206 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm asking about your position, just your position, and I want to know if there's a specificity in your particular reality that makes that the common analysis that all three came to would not make sense in your particular situation. That's all I'm asking.", "3207 MS. HOLLIS: It makes sense in our particular situation.", "3208 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "3209 Similarly, the 1.5 up, how did you come -- it's the same rationale? You based it on that common study?", "3210 MR. ALEXANDER: We did, yes.", "3211 THE CHAIRPERSON: And again, you accept that as appropriate in light of your knowledge of Nunavut?", "3212 MR. ALEXANDER: So as part of the original investigation of the report, it did reach out to specifically the different areas inside Nunavut to validate our unique requirements so that our unique requirements were covered as part of the report, not to say that we were the exception but that we, as inclusive, this would meet all our needs to be able to deliver and have access to services.", "3213 THE CHAIRPERSON: Beyond speed, we've been talking a lot about capacity and I think affordability is an issue that you've raised. As we set, you know, about to develop a record on the possibility of setting a BSO for broadband, do you have a view or can you help us better understand in terms of monthly data caps what we should be examining?", "3214 MR. ALEXANDER: I think as an item to take a look at is over the last three different initiatives that have been used to fund access for service inside Nunavut, each time that a cap was created, the cap was met instantaneously within the first month of serving access.", "3215 So trying to set a standard that we feel in Nunavut would be acceptable watching each time -- as I pointed out this morning, they increased their cap to 20 gigs this month. When the billing cycle comes in May, most people will have reached that 20 gig limit. So trying to pick a number that is going to be an appropriate value, I don\u2019t know if we have a specific number that may meet that requirement showing our history that anytime any cap is added, we reached that cap.", "3216 THE CHAIRPERSON: You understand that that's not very useful to us because it leaves it without any guidance in terms of what, if we were going to set a minimum amount of basic broadband services BSO, what it includes because it's not just not a question of speed.", "3217 MR. MANOLL: If I had to pick one today, I would probably pick 40 or 50.", "3218 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "3219 MR. MANOLL: And the reason I would come up with that is there's a lot of -- and just from personal reasons and without the research is that most families that I'm aware of will have multiple service providers, whether it's Northwestel or SSi, and they do that so they can get the combination of their caps together so they don\u2019t have to go into overuse.", "3220 So if SSi is providing 20 gigs and Northwestel is providing 20 gigs, multiple families will have both services to give them a collective 40, of which they tend to max out. So if I say 50, that gives you about a 25 percent buffer, so in that range.", "3221 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you see that as well as being a moving target over time?", "3222 MR. MANOLL: Absolutely. It's where is the technology going and what new applications are going to be added. If the data is there and the technology is there, it will be used more for multiple reasons.", "3223 THE CHAIRPERSON: Affordability is a bit of a difficult aspect to define and I was hoping that perhaps as I did with Yukon, getting a little bit of your experience in trying to find what's affordable based on your knowledge of the population in Nunavut.", "3224 So I take it there are social assistance programs in Nunavut?", "3225 MR. ALEXANDER: Yes, there are.", "3226 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. So in establishing the level of support, how does the government in Nunavut allocate the costs of communication services?", "3227 MR. ALEXANDER: The ongoing or sorry?", "3228 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, if you set a particular amount of social assistance at \u201cx\u201d number of dollars total let's say per month, how much is allocated for communication services within that?", "3229 MR. ALEXANDER: Right now in the social assistance program, none of it is.", "3230 THE CHAIRPERSON: None of it. So there's zero associated both for broadband, telephony.", "3231 MR. ALEXANDER: Correct. Right now, the ---", "3232 THE CHAIRPERSON: Cable, television or anything like that.", "3233 MR. ALEXANDER: The four areas that are covered right now under the social assistance program is housing, food, clothing, and power, so having access to power.", "3234 THE CHAIRPERSON: And do you foresee that changing at all over the next while or is that -- because these things change over time, right? What becomes basic household necessities evolve over time. Do you see that changing in the social assistance program evaluation in Nunavut?", "3235 MR. ALEXANDER: As this time, I think we'd have to take that as an undertaking and go find out from the department that is responsible for delivering social services -- social assistance. ", "3236 ", "UNDERTAKING", "3237 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, that would -- we\u2019d appreciate that. And while you\u2019re at it, maybe understand why it is not -- why communication needs are not part of that calculation.", "3238 MR. ALEXANDER: Okay.", "3239 MS. HOLLIS: We can answer that one right now.", "3240 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, good. ", "3241 MS. HOLLIS: Food is more important; a roof is more important; not freezing in the dark is more important; and having clothes to wear outside 10 months of the year is more important. We are -- you\u2019ve asked for basic; we are so basic.", "3242 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m not denying that those in the hierarchy of needs -- obviously the needs you\u2019ve just mentioned are higher. I\u2019m just trying to understand, when we talk about affordability, what in your particular circumstance does the government and the leadership of the government see as affordable in terms of communications. In fact, you can perhaps, from what you just said, extrapolate that there is -- nothing is affordable in that sense, right?", "3243 MS. HOLLIS: Pretty close.", "3244 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "3245 MS. HOLLIS: Almost everything you spend money on in Nunavut means that you can\u2019t have something else that you really kind of need.", "3246 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So in your submission you also talked about the need for the government itself to benefit from broadband services, as a provider of service. I was wondering -- I\u2019m not sure if medium business makes sense but at least small businesses, what, in terms of your assessment, are small business needs with straight to broadband access or would they necessarily be covered by the sort of services you\u2019re suggesting individual residential customers would get, that that would be enough even for business purposes?", "3247 MR. BOWLER: I guess it depends on the business. And certainly some with greater needs are going to have challenges and others, I guess, manage with the current prices and packages.", "3248 THE CHAIRPERSON: Does -- from an economic development perspective, because I know some of the work has been done to look at broadband not just from a social, education, health perspective but it\u2019s also important from an economic development perspective. Has there not been any evaluation of what basic broadband levels might be to support a business opportunity in the Territory?", "3249 MS. HOLLIS: The 9 and 1.5 supports the basic -- again, banking and point of sale, the ability to do basic research, the ability to buy online, to publish, to keep -- to maintain a website -- again basic.", "3250 THE CHAIRPERSON: M\u2019hm.", "3251 MS. HOLLIS: You\u2019ve introduce another word in the question; is that enough? And I\u2019m a little concerned about the difference between basic and enough. Or are you using them as synonyms?", "3252 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m trying to get my head around what business uses might be dependant on broadband, for instance, I don\u2019t know, a hotel or other tourism activity ---", "3253 MS. HOLLIS: M\u2019hm.", "3254 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- and whether when we were thinking of what the basic service obligation might be with respect to broadband whether 9 and 1.5 is sufficient to actually support and help economic development. ", "3255 MS. HOLLIS: To run a small business, probably the numbers we\u2019ve used are -- right? Yeah. Now, for a mine, that would be something else and ---", "3256 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. But presumably, then, we\u2019re not in a small business anymore ---", "3257 MS. HOLLIS: Right.", "3258 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- and the size of that company would be sufficient to -- they would obtain the services to support their mining activities on uploads and downloads separately. It was part of the business case, right? Is that correct?", "3259 MS. HOLLIS: I would think so.", "3260 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Let me turn to directory information. We haven\u2019t spoken a lot about that and I was wondering to what extent is directory information important to residents and businesses in Nunavut?", "3261 MR. ALEXANDER: Right now in Nunavut we have the privilege of having our current directory services translated into Inuktitut which is still the dominant language in the Territory. And we still have unilingual people that don\u2019t read English so having that capacity is of great benefit to communities especially where broadband access may not necessarily may not be something that\u2019s affordable.", "3262 THE CHAIRPERSON: So -- and I know you don\u2019t want to comment on other parts of Canada but certainly from your perspective a printed directory has a specific importance particularly because of that additional language?", "3263 MR. ALEXANDER: Correct.", "3264 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. And is this how residents and businesses currently would access government numbers if they needed to?", "3265 MR. ALEXANDER: It is one method of accessing government access. We do have an online published access as well. However, the main printed copy is still used as a source for accessing government contact points.", "3266 THE CHAIRPERSON: It almost begs the question, if you think that the access to internet is not as universally accessible, why would the government have put numbers on the internet? I guess some people use it; is that what you\u2019re saying?", "3267 MR. ALEXANDER: We are saying that some people use it but it\u2019s also for Southern people or Southern contacts to be able to find our numbers as well, not just the people within the territory.", "3268 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And is that in Inuktitut as well or do you just provide -- do you do it like the phonebook or not?", "3269 MR. ALEXANDER: I\u2019d have to double-check. I\u2019ll take that as a takeback and find the actual answer. I believe our website is fully printed in all four languages as well as the directory for lookup.", "3270 ", "UNDERTAKING", "3271 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. You talked in your presentation about the importance of education -- to use broadband to help educational needs of individuals. I\u2019d like to dig around a little bit more around the notion of digital literacy, you know, arguably not at the core of the CRTCs mandate but certainly something that we might want to develop a record on as best practices or what you know with respect to this.", "3272 Have you studied the amount of digital literacy in Nunavut?", "3273 MR. ALEXANDER: I don\u2019t believe we have directly studied the digital literacy levels in Nunavut. I\u2019d have to take that away and find out for sure for you ---", "3274 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "3275 MR. ALEXANDER: --- because I know that there has been some research around the ---", "3276 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, either yourself or third parties might have looked at it.", "3277 MR. ALEXANDER: Yeah.", "3278 THE CHAIRPERSON: If you could get back to us?", "3279 MR. ALEXANDER: Yeah.", "3280 ", "UNDERTAKING", "3281 THE CHAIRPERSON: And the follow up would be, if there was when you do -- if there is some and you have a look at them, whether there are best practices that we should be aware of out of those studies.", "3282 MR. ALEXANDER: Okay.", "3283 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay?", "3284 MR. ALEXANDER: Yeah.", "3285 THE CHAIRPERSON: I appreciate you might not have that at the tip of your fingers.", "3286 Is digital literacy part of the educational program either at -- you know, for younger children or in adult education at all?", "3287 MR. ALEXANDER: It is. There\u2019s access to computer labs in every school that is inside the Territory as well as the local Territorial Arctic College. So the Nunavut Arctic College also has a community learning centre in every community within the Territory and they are delivering programs specifically at the college at the adult level. ", "3288 There\u2019s a program that our department, Community and Government Services, supports that is the Computer Systems Technician Program. So we are funding the running of that program through the Arctic College but the Department of Education and their initiatives for access to computers and that information, I\u2019d have to find out the actual information for you. I can take that as an undertaking and get the material back to you.", "3289 ", "UNDERTAKING", "3290 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Are these facilities used at all as a kind of hub or anchor for the rest of the community where they\u2019re present?", "3291 MR. ALEXANDER: The schools tend to be in some cases the main community hall or main gathering point because of the fact that they have a large gymnasium attached to them. So after-hours usage for taekwondo training, or a yoga class, or a youth drop-in does exist in a lot of the communities, so it does act as a hub in that sense.", "3292 But when it comes to as a hub for access to information, after the community access program stopped some of that function fell onto the territorial government to start providing innovative ways of providing that style of service back to the community.", "3293 So we have continued to help support some of the community access program locations while we try to figure out the next step. Because after the cap program was deemed a success, the funding process for it sort of teetered off and now, we\u2019re at a point where we\u2019re trying to just -- in Nunavut, we still need to bring that digital literacy level up -- so trying to find the right -- a way to do that.", "3294 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Would it be fair to describe it as -- let\u2019s say for children that may not have access at home to either connectivity or devices, that a community centre could be a place where they could access broadband connectivity?", "3295 MR. ALEXANDER: Absolutely. Or in some cases the only spot where they access broadband at present.", "3296 THE CHAIRPERSON: And with support to teach them how to do so beyond -- well, perhaps they already know and people are often quite adept at these things, but there would be as well support to build on the sort of digital literacy required to do so?", "3297 MR. ALEXANDER: Correct. Yes.", "3298 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right?", "3299 MR. ALEXANDER: Yes.", "3300 THE CHAIRPERSON: They\u2019re not just left on their own?", "3301 MR. ALEXANDER: Correct.", "3302 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "3303 Maybe you were in the room earlier when we had some presentation by SSi and BDC. And one of the messages I took away from their presentation is that the solutions that we\u2019re looking at will probably require long-term commitment. I also heard the word \u201cholistic\u201d commitment.", "3304 And that is, in part, because you want to have long-term business planning and return on investment over a long period of time, and the reality of that is that it would require looking at these issues beyond normal parliamentary cycles.", "3305 Would you agree that that is a wise way of thinking about what the long -- the solutions might be; that they have to be looked at in a longer term horizon?", "3306 MR. ALEXANDER: Yes. We have -- as a government, we\u2019ve taken that same stance during the last time we were in front of the Commission to make a similar statement with the Northwest Tel modernization review. We said at that same time a holistic review of what we have is required for Nunavut.", "3307 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Would you agree that we\u2019re not quite there yet?", "3308 MR. ALEXANDER: I would.", "3309 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "3310 The Open Gateway model; do you have views on it?", "3311 MR. ALEXANDER: We\u2019ve had that conversation with SSi Micro on their design. We are trying to be innovative at the government level, taking away the traditional method of fixed service solutions. We have to be innovative in how we\u2019re going to deliver service in the North. ", "3312 But an actual concept -- comment regarding the Open Gateway model at present, we don\u2019t have one.", "3313 THE CHAIRPERSON: And I appreciate that it\u2019s delicate because there\u2019s not a lot of suppliers and you don\u2019t want to show your cards too publicly at this stage.", "3314 MR. ALEXANDER: True and we also are in contract obligations with SSi as our current service provider.", "3315 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Let me ask the question differently then.", "3316 When you\u2019re looking at, in the future, innovative solutions, what would be some of the hallmarks that you would want to advance in looking at innovative solutions in terms of pros and cons, risk, risk management solutions?", "3317 MS. HOLLIS: I\u2019m not sure exactly where you\u2019re going with this, but I\u2019ll try a couple of things and see if we\u2019re in the right ballpark.", "3318 Certainly, SSi made the point that the government system is idle while the residential system is working. Absolutely, there are economies and things we can do that -- not that I can commit the Government of Nunavut but certainly we would look at ways of optimizing available usage.", "3319 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "3320 MS. HOLLIS: Another one is ---", "3321 THE CHAIRPERSON: That\u2019s not quite -- it was going to be my next question, but you\u2019ve already answered it.", "3322 MS. HOLLIS: Okay.", "3323 THE CHAIRPERSON: So there\u2019s an openness on your side, I take it, and there\u2019s ongoing discussions. And I don\u2019t think we can go very much further than that.", "3324 MS. HOLLIS: Right.", "3325 Another one would be, you know, looking at collaborating with other governments, other territorial governments, Labrador and Newfoundland, KRG, Quebec, maybe the James Bay Nations. There are -- so collaboration is up there, and that is also just a hugely important northern thing. Nobody can go alone in the North. You have to collaborate.", "3326 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "3327 MS. HOLLIS: Another one would be looking at possible lean construction techniques. There are -- you know, derived from the Toyota systems. There are new ways of coming in that maximize construction efficiencies.", "3328 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "3329 MS. HOLLIS: So ---", "3330 THE CHAIRPERSON: And -- and I know you don\u2019t want to talk about the Open Gateway, but there is an element of that in that.", "3331 So those are the sorts of things, without endorsing necessarily their particular model.", "3332 MS. HOLLIS: Right.", "3333 THE CHAIRPERSON: So a quick construction, short period, being able to repeat quickly from one community to the next. Would that be another indicia of something that might be new in Nunavut?", "3334 MS. HOLLIS: Efficiencies of all kinds like that.", "3335 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "3336 MS. HOLLIS: Yes, absolutely, and innovations of all kinds. We were all ears listening to the Eastern Ontario experience.", "3337 Oh, and also flexibility on the federal funding envelopes.", "3338 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "3339 MS. HOLLIS: The point that EO made so well.", "3340 THE CHAIRPERSON: There were comments earlier that although perhaps -- and that\u2019s interesting, you mentioned the previous group from Eastern Ontario. I think there was a recognition that in an ideal world a wireline, perhaps even fibre solution, would be the best thing but then practicality comes into play.", "3341 And with respect to your particular situation, it was put forward earlier that we could hope for a fibre solution but perhaps let\u2019s be a little bit more realistic and realize that over the foreseeable future, it will be a satellite driven backbone.", "3342 Would you agree with that; that it will likely -- that there is nothing we see right now that suggests anything other than satellite?", "3343 MS. HOLLIS: Given how long a fibre build takes, yeah.", "3344 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. And therefore, when we look at the backbone connectivity or transport issue, we\u2019re necessarily in a satellite model?", "3345 MS. HOLLIS: Yes.", "3346 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "3347 You appreciate that nodding heads don\u2019t make it to the transcript?", "3348 MS. HOLLIS: That\u2019s why I pushed the button.", "3349 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "3350 And we\u2019ve had conversations about the challenge of satellite and I\u2019m not an accountant, so I don\u2019t know, but sometimes costs around satellites, one would describe as capital; others, operating; and others, maintenance.", "3351 Do you have views as to if we were to explore options with respect to transport, and in this case satellite transport, where the Commission should put its efforts and what kind of model should we be looking at? ", "3352 Is it one that supports capital; expenditures; operating or maintenance? Although I guess the maintenance could be either capital or operating.", "3353 MR. ALEXANDER: In our realm of how we look at it, it would be falling under capital to start, as the initial build requirement is the upfront capital requirement to build the infrastructure.", "3354 As the others have alluded from earlier today that the ongoing is a concern as well, but it\u2019s one of the ways that our current process for funding similar builds is we\u2019ve done ours through capital expenditures.", "3355 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "3356 It\u2019s my last here -- just my colleagues to get prepared if they have any questions.", "3357 I appreciate that that\u2019s from your perspective. When it comes to us, because you\u2019ve heard that people have asked us to create some sort of financial support model through subsidy or not. ", "3358 I was asking my question is that context, whereas, you know, I understand you, as the government, would prefer to get involved in the capital side.", "3359 When we step in, potentially, what kind of support do you think would be most efficient in your reality in Nunavut?", "3360 MR. ALEXANDER: In our reality, we have -- it would be a mixture of both the upfront build and then the ongoing support as well.", "3361 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, and through whom would the ongoing support be delivered?", "3362 MR. ALEXANDER: In our case we would look at it as the incumbent who is providing the broadband service. So if we have multiple suppliers that are available, it would be the one that is currently providing for that specific subscriber.", "3363 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Help me square that with your comment in your submissions that you don\u2019t want us to create a monopoly or oligopoly? Because essentially you might find yourself in a situation where one player does get the benefits but not the other. And how do you do that?", "3364 MS. HOLLIS: I have to say my reaction to that is that that question exactly illustrates what\u2019s wrong with the current subsidy, that it isn\u2019t possible to not, you know, create or enhance a monopoly or oligopoly. I mean, that\u2019s kind of what you get with satellites.", "3365 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Which may plead in favour of another completely different model, whether we call it open gateway or other type of anchor solution. It may be the better way of going about it, that\u2019s then available to all access suppliers in a given community.", "3366 MS. HOLLIS: We have collectively painted ourselves into a corner and the solution is going to be artificial in its nature is what I keep coming up with. It\u2019s that we\u2019re going to have to find some way of spreading that money around.", "3367 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s artificial as much as it\u2019s a reality because there\u2019s a market failure and, therefore, it\u2019s driven by public policy as opposed to ---", "3368 MS. HOLLIS: Maybe regulatory would be a better word than artificial.", "3369 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, perhaps, indeed.", "3370 Okay, those are my questions. I\u2019m going to turn to my colleagues and see if there are any questions.", "3371 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I\u2019ve just got one.", "3372 THE CHAIRPERSON: Mr. Menzies?", "3373 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It\u2019s kind of a social question. I\u2019m kind of curious when I listen to the northern groups and they look at proceedings like this and they see other groups asking for much more, for free internet or for unlimited speeds essentially, gigabyte services, and no data caps and that sort of stuff.", "3374 If I walked down the street in Iqaluit and asked people about that, what sort of response would I get?", "3375 MR. ALEXANDER: You would get everybody excited to hear that you would be able to deliver something like that. However, they would say, \u201cAt what cost?\u201d Because one of the realities that we recognize living in such an isolated environment is that cost is a driving factor for unlimited access.", "3376 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "3377 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner MacDonald?", "3378 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good afternoon.", "3379 Just one question that\u2019s following up on the Chair\u2019s final question.", "3380 I get that more competition is better; competition breeds innovation and more competitive pricing. But if through any funding the majority of the funding does happen to go to a single provider or a strengthening of a current monopoly that\u2019s in place, if the end result is better speeds or higher data caps, does that end result not trump any harm that may be created through the enhancement of a current monopoly? And how much competition is realistically viable in Nunavut given the population spread across 20 percent of Canada\u2019s landmass?", "3381 MS. HOLLIS: I learned in logic class that any if-then proposition that starts with a false statement is necessarily true -- to say if a monopoly resulted in, you know, better speeds and more affordability yeah, we\u2019d all over that. But that\u2019s not our experience. That is absolutely not our experience. The monopoly situation was not good for Nunavut. And our experiences that as SSi showed up, as Ice Wireless showed as others showed up, that things got better really fast.", "3382 So to say, you know, \u201cWell, if a monopoly made it better,\u201d it\u2019s like, but they don\u2019t. It\u2019s just so hard for me to accept that basic premise. Yeah, a benign monopoly that took care of us, yeah, that would be really sweet. But I haven\u2019t seen it.", "3383 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, thank you.", "3384 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Those are our questions.", "3386 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "3387 I will now ask NWT Association of Communities to come to the presentation table.", "3388 --- (SHORT PAUSE)", "3389 THE SECRETARY: Please introduce yourself and when you\u2019re ready you have 10 minutes.", "PRESENTATION ", "3390 MS. BROWN: Thank you very much. Thank you Commissioners for allowing us this opportunity to speak. And I\u2019m very pleased to be here and let you know our perspective of the NWT communities.", "3391 I am Sara Brown. I\u2019m the CEO of the NWT Association of Communities. We represent all 33 communities in the Northwest Territories. And we have a resolution that speaks to the importance of telecommunications and the viability of our communities on so many levels -- social, economic -- and that we hope that we will see some significant improvements. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today.", "3392 I think it was just last week that the Commission released a map showing service across the country. And it\u2019s very clear that you don\u2019t see that across the north. Lots of colour across the southern bands in Canada and not across the north.", "3393 I\u2019m not a technical person within this industry. So I\u2019m going to speak to you about what it means on the ground, trying to function in these small remote communities, of which of our 33, 10 are as I understand it satellite-based. So we have an interesting mix of fibre and satellite across the territory.", "3394 One of the things that happens, and the presenters from Nunavut really talked about this a lot, is the isolation. We are very different from rural. We are not rural. It does not look the same. We can\u2019t drive to the next town. ", "3395 Everybody in the north has these wonderful stories about talking to the bank and the bank saying, \u201cCome on it and sign that.\u201d ", "3396 \u201cWell, no, no, no. Our nearest branch is 1,500 kilometres away.\u201d We can\u2019t function in those sorts of things. We can\u2019t go to the next town for resources. We really absolutely rely on the internet. It could be such an important tool to us, but we don\u2019t have that opportunity because of our speeds and our capacity.", "3397 Things like hospitals. Most of our communities have nursing stations. And even in our regional centres we rely heavily on expertise from the south. So that connectivity is very, very critical from sending down x-rays, reports, scans to making life and death situational decisions on the ground -- a nurse trying to get advice about whether to bring in the MedEvac or not bring in the MedEvac. It\u2019s absolutely critical to be able to rely on that and to have the speeds that allow you to do that function.", "3398 Education. We talked about education a lot. We heard lots of things about that today. And that starts right at a school level, a junior school level, that ability to stay and be exposed to things that you might not be otherwise. Right now one of our communities, their music program is actually offered by somebody in the south. There is nobody with that expertise in the community so they are actually having classes through Skype. And that\u2019s absolutely critical.", "3399 And it becomes even more so when you start talking about core courses, that ability to take a calculus class at the end of a high school career, or that adult education to be able to do your online MBA. You know, something simple like attending a meeting can become a big deal. If you go from a community like Paulatuk, it takes a week to go to a half-day meeting or an hour-long meeting.", "3400 So having that connectivity to be able to participate in the digital world becomes absolutely critical.", "3401 Many of our communities do not have policy detachments. Again, that reliability, connectivity absolutely critical.", "3402 You know, we talked about lots of economic issues. The territorial government just did an economic opportunity strategy, a really strong document, and it involved meeting with communities across the territory. And everywhere they heard that the broadband issues were absolutely stopping or slowing down their ability to grow. They heard that across the north, even in communities like Yellowknife that have a fairly good level of service, but we have some reliability issues and we have capacity issues that are affecting our ability to actively participate.", "3403 You know, you\u2019re in a small community and things like somebody puts a logo and attaches a 5-meg document, which you would think nothing of. All of a sudden you might as well go get a coffee because your system is down as you\u2019re downloading that material.", "3404 I recently went, and this is in Yellowknife, to send a 10-minute video for upload to be used in an education program. The first time I did it it said it was going to take 11 hours. So I stopped it, went back and picked another time and it only took four.", "3405 So I mean, those are the kinds of issues that you really don\u2019t realize how much the digital economy has moved into what we do every day. And when you can\u2019t actively participate in it, what a detriment that is.", "3406 The NWT, and I can\u2019t speak to the rest of the north, has been experiencing a lot of out-migration. So they\u2019re always struggling to keep and attract people. Well, just as a high-speed internet can be an attractant, a lack of one can be a detractant. You know, if somebody is thinking about moving there and they have to tell their kids that they\u2019re not going to have download speeds that are going to allow them to watch a YouTube video -- I can\u2019t watch a YouTube video at home. That is a detractant to you coming and participating.", "3407 I think you\u2019ve talked quite a lot about market forces and how they can\u2019t really drive this, so we look forward to your guidance. And I apologize; I can\u2019t offer a lot of advice about how you might make that happen, about how we can do things and move that ahead.", "3408 Certainly we have talked about the 9 megabytes per second for download and 1.5 for upload based on the same study that Nunavut\u2019s government was representing using because we have to rely on that expertise. They did a very exhaustive review of the various users within the community so we certainly have to acknowledge that and look at that.", "3409 And one of the other issues we have is a lack of redundancy. We have communities that will go offline for days at a time, not, you know, a half hour, day. Even Yellowknife our speeds can just suddenly drop and we\u2019ll be almost unable to check emails for a day, half a day, two days sometimes.", "3410 So I just wanted to let you know you don\u2019t realize how much the digital world has become part of how you live every day until you miss it like our communities do.", "3411 So thank you very much.", "3412 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "3413 Vice-Chair Menzies will have some questions for you.", "3414 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. I have a few questions.", "3415 Are things better than they were five years ago?", "3416 MS. BROWN: Yes. My understanding is they are better and some of the other work that is being done by NorthwesTel is improving the situation in some of the communities over the next year to year and a half. But that\u2019s to achieve the 5 and 1 at this point.", "3417 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But there are a number of communities that have better than 5 and 1, right?", "3418 MS. BROWN: There are.", "3419 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: There\u2019s 15?", "3420 MS. BROWN: Yeah.", "3421 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Not some of the communities you\u2019re talking about. I mean, there\u2019s quite a contrast, right?", "3422 MS. BROWN: Absolutely.", "3423 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Because I\u2019ve been to the big places like Yellowknife and Inuvik, and except when the satellite turns around it\u2019s general pretty good.", "3424 MS. BROWN: Yes, yes. Those major centres are better, absolutely.", "3425 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Then the challenge then is connecting some of the smaller communities.", "3426 How many of those do you think will be able to benefit in the short-term from the Mackenzie Valley fibre project?", "3427 MS. BROWN: I\u2019m hearing mixed comments on that. My understanding is quite a number would be. But then I\u2019ve asked for confirmation of that and I haven\u2019t received that yet, truly understanding that they will get full access to the fibre going by.", "3428 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So maybe you could just dispossess me of this notion that the biggest issue would be the satellite communities? ", "3429 MS. BROWN: It would be the biggest issue but not the only issue.", "3430 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But not the only issue, okay.", "3431 In your initial submission you referenced the issue of redundancy.", "3432 MS. BROWN: M\u2019hm.", "3433 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Could you basically outline what the current situation is in terms of community connectivity and redundancy?", "3434 MS. BROWN: Yeah. My understanding is there is relatively little redundancy and that\u2019s why we\u2019re having these long-term outages. So if there is a problem anywhere on the network -- even Yellowknife we experienced quite a number of days of no service or very low service because of a failure in the line on the way north. So there\u2019s absolutely no redundancy in the system as I understand it.", "3435 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Are you optimistic that that might be resolved with completion of the Mackenzie Valley fibre and the Dempster project?", "3436 MS. BROWN: I don\u2019t believe it would be but I don\u2019t know that absolutely.", "3437 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "3438 In your initial submission you talked about affordability quite a bit. What sort of reference points would you have us use to define affordability, in part given that the EKOS survey that we did, Northwest Territories was reasonable notable in its acceptance of the situation where they might have to pay a little bit more for that?", "3439 MS. BROWN: There certainly is an understanding that we pay a premium where we are for all our services. But we\u2019re always trying to get those numbers down.", "3440 But yeah, there is a certain acceptance that there should be some premium, but not excessive. Like, all our ---", "3441 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So can you give me a best guess what that might be? I mean, generally costs in the north are what? About 30 percent higher?", "3442 MS. BROWN: I would recommend that it might be worthwhile to look at some of the cost of living indexes and say, \u201cOkay, this is reasonable. In the absence of anything else this would be a reasonable assumption,\u201d that those costs of living indices could apply to broadband as well.", "3443 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You think people would accept if something cost $50 in Edmonton, it might cost $65 in Yellowknife? That\u2019s within the realm of non-hysterical reaction?", "3444 MS. BROWN: I wouldn\u2019t want to put words in people\u2019s mouth, but they understand that ---", "3445 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, I\u2019m just asking in your own sense.", "3446 MS. BROWN: Yeah, I would think so and I would think particularly if it was in line with what the difference in the cost of living indexes were between the two places.", "3447 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And if the service was comparable?", "3448 MS. BROWN: Yes, and the service was comparable, absolutely.", "3449 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. It would be one thing to be $100 for 10 percent of what somebody else got for 60.", "3450 MS. BROWN: Right. Absolutely.", "3451 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Do you have an indication of how many of the communities you represent currently have access to speeds of 5 and 1?", "3452 MS. BROWN: I couldn\u2019t comment off the top of my head on currently, but my understanding from NorthwesTel is that all of them will have them by 2017.", "3453 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: By next year?", "3454 MS. BROWN: Yes.", "3455 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "3456 The target speeds you suggested, 9 and 1.5, sound similar to what we just heard from Nunavut. Is it sourced from the same NCIS working group?", "3457 MS. BROWN: Yeah, same study.", "3458 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. But you also suggest 11 and 16 for education and healthcare locations?", "3459 MS. BROWN: Again that was identified in that study, that those would be better speeds for those particular uses. That those -- they sort of -- there was everybody else and then they carved off (inaudible).", "3460 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It said sourced from the same ---", "3461 MS. BROWN: The same study, yes.", "3462 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: From the same report and essentially, as I recall that report, education and healthcare had those big upload needs.", "3463 MS. BROWN: Right, right. ", "3464 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So ---", "3465 MS. BROWN: Yes, yes. ", "3466 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay and that -- so you believe that standards for those both speeds would meet basic requirements?", "3467 MS. BROWN: Sorry, can I ask you to rephrase that?", "3468 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sorry, it\u2019s 9 and 1.5.", "3469 MS. BROWN: M\u2019hm.", "3470 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: If the Commission decided to mandate internet as part of the basic service --", "3471 MS. BROWN: M\u2019hm.", "3472 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- that speeds -- download speeds of 9, with upload of 1.5, would meet what you believe to be basic service and for education and healthcare locations 11 and 16?", "3473 MS. BROWN: I believe that it certainly seemed that that was a very thorough examination in the report and that was their conclusion, so.", "3474 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right and that would also meet small business needs? Small-medium business?", "3475 MS. BROWN: It -- that\u2019s my understanding from that report, yes.", "3476 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "3477 Do you have any estimates for us on how much it would cost to bring internet access in the communities you represent up to the levels you suggest? ", "3478 MS. BROWN: I have no knowledge of that.", "3479 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "3480 How do you think it -- if it were to be subsidized how do you think it should be subsidized?", "3481 MS. BROWN: Again, as somebody who\u2019s not part of the industry it would be very hard for me to comment on that. ", "3482 I don\u2019t live this world day-to-day, so I don\u2019t understand the structures that have been used to date and I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on them going forward.", "3483 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But would it be fair for me to assume because you\u2019ve raised the issue of affordability --", "3484 MS. BROWN: Yes.", "3485 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- that the answer would be someone else?", "3486 MS. BROWN: That would be a fair assumption, yes. ", "--- (LAUGHTER) ", "3487 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "3488 Do you think there\u2019s any opportunity for some of the northern Indigenous funding -- I think it was 8.4 billion, 255 million for infrastructure, would be of assistance to any -- would be accessible to any of those communities? ", "3489 MS. BROWN: I --- ", "3490 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Would make a difference?", "3491 MS. BROWN: Yes, I know there was lots of funding. It was not -- some of those line items were not clear that they would apply to our communities, because we are not all on Reserve. ", "3492 We only have two Reserves and so some of the funding was allocated differently on-Reserve versus off-Reserve.", "3493 But as well I know we have a very, just like Nunavut, a very significant infrastructure deficit, both -- at a municipal level our communities are underfunded by 40 percent, our territorial government is going to be reaching its debt cap at 2018.", "3494 They are in a very significant fiscal situation and are very, very concerned and that\u2019s just to meet their current needs. ", "3495 So I\u2019m not sure that there would be -- I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on their ability to participate. ", "3496 Now the one opportunity that may be there within the context of the Aboriginal governments is for some of our development corps to participate as private partners. ", "3497 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "3498 When you talked about out migration, I understood that you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a lack of access to the same quality of communications network --", "3499 MS. BROWN: M\u2019hm.", "3500 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- as people in at least in cities in the south have, might be encouraging that, but just to challenge that, aren\u2019t -- wouldn\u2019t there be -- how would that fit up against other factors such as resource prices, mine closure? ", "3501 I mean --", "3502 MS. BROWN: Yes.", "3503 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- even one time somebody at the Chamber of Commerce in Yellowknife told me I made a comment about since WestJet is flying there the airfares it\u2019s much cheaper to get there.

BROWN: Yes.", "3507 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And you can go to Edmonton and go shopping for the weekend -- ", "3508 MS. BROWN: Yes.", "3509 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- and basically pay for your airfare on the costs and that would have an impact on retail sector.", "3510 MS.

You may begin, you have five minutes. Thank you.", "3536 MR. ADAMS: Good day.", "3537 THE CHAIRPERSON: Sorry, Mr. Adams, before you get started, I notice that you have added with your presentation a lot of documents. And as you know, I appreciate you might not be familiar with the rules of procedure that we use but normally, out of fairness, let\u2019s say that we don\u2019t add documents at the last minute. We try to do that ahead of time.", "3538 So I\u2019m going to give you an opportunity to explain why these documents you were unable to put them forward on the record earlier, so that those contrary to interests would have seen them sooner in the process.

ADAMS: Yes, Mr. Chairman.", "3541 I was about to ask permission from the hearing Secretary to introduce new evidence in the form of a booklet to include the electronic links that I have detailed within said documents. The reasoning for this is this is new evidence that is directly relevant to my video and to my speech that I will detail before the Commission and for the review of CRTC 2015-134.", "3542 THE CHAIRPERSON: Sure. How is it new? Did it only arise after an intervention period?", "3543 MR. ADAMS: Overall, it did.

My name is Ryan Adams.", "3553 I am an individual who has been made aware of many issues with broadband deployment in Eastern and Northern Ontario that have left some without service, and others forced to pay incredibly high rates. I also allege the misuse and inappropriate spending of public funds by Bell.", "3554 I would like to outline a short excerpt of the evidence I have presented to the Commission related to the Bell Deferral Accounts broadband rollout, and the alleged use of public funds to subsidize deferral obligations in communities.", "3555 Deferral accounts are similar to a fund being considered by the Commission where money would be set aside to provide broadband services. The Deferral accounts also detailed that broadband was to be afforded in a manner similar to a basic service objective.", "3556 I prepared a short video to better represent my arguments and outline the true involvement of public funds in deferral communities. ", "3557 Roll the video please.", "3558 (VIDEO PRESENTATION)", "3559 MR. ADAMS: My allegations are simple and clear. Bell has used grant funds to provide broadband to deferral communities, contrary to the rulings and decision of the Commission.", "3560 The Company further leveraged the decision in CRTC 210805 to not only misuse grant funds but apply punitive pricing through the overlapping boundaries of wireless.", "3561 Bell\u2019s actions are highly prejudiced towards both deferral and non-deferral communities.", "3562 The solution to this disadvantageous practice, as per my written submission, is not to allow the selective implementation of the most expensive technologies and price gouging to communities as part of a basic service objective.", "3563 This statement includes the consideration that many incumbent companies often service a community with landline voice or television, and a preference towards less regulated wireless internet.", "3564 To conclude my presentation, there are many similarities between the Deferral Accounts Broadband Rollout and a proposed Commission managed fund to subsidize broadband. There are also many lessons to be learned from the past rollout.", "3565 I am strongly supportive of the concept of a CRTC managed fund that would provide broadband in my community, in addition to a basic service objective.", "3566 In closing, I would like to thank the Commission for its time and consideration of my presentation and welcome any questions you may have.", "3567 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Vice-Chair Menzies will ask you some questions. Thanks.", "3568 MR. ADAMS: Thank you.", "3569 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. What do you use the internet for?", "3570 MR. ADAMS: My wife uses the internet for work. She is a pharmacist who provides remote telepharmacy through the internet to communities that are typically not serviced by pharmacists; remote communities, Hearst, Cochrane, there\u2019s a few others.", "3571 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That doesn\u2019t sound, on the face of it, as something that would require intense speeds; is it?", "3572 MR. ADAMS: It connects using a VPN and not the typical VPN that\u2019s often referred to ---", "3573 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "3574 MR. ADAMS: By Netflix and all that.", "3575 Over all, the band width usage is what\u2019s important. Average 2 to 5 Gigabytes per day.", "3576 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So that\u2019s 125, 150 a month? Well, working days it\u2019s less, right?", "3577 MR. ADAMS: M\u2019hm.", "3578 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "3579 MR. ADAMS: I will note my costs here. I have an average of a five-year cost at $276.29 monthly. Over five years we\u2019ve paid $16,577 for internet. I will note that this is for a typical 5-1 wireless service.", "3580 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. And if you\u2019re operating a business that\u2019s ---", "3581 MR. ADAMS: What\u2019s that?", "3582 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s part of the business cost, right?", "3583 MR. ADAMS: Overall yes, I guess you could call it as part of a business cost, yes. The internet is used both for home and business usage. However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call myself a heavy user in the sense of things like video streaming and all that.", "3584 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But your spouse is running a business out of the house, right?", "3585 MR. ADAMS: What\u2019s that?", "3586 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Your spouse is running a business out of the house?", "3587 MR. ADAMS: No, she works for a company.", "3588 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Oh, I see. She\u2019s an employee working from home.", "3589 MR. ADAMS: Yes.", "3590 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I understand.", "3591 So notwithstanding your concerns regarding Bell, help me understand the situation in Pembroke because when I looked up their website it describes Pembroke in a much different way than you describe it. It describes it as:", "3592 \u201cPembroke is a smart community with fully a redundant fibre optic ring around the city with frame relay services and an asynchronous transfer made over sonnet ring. Several telcos offer business services and solutions\u2026 We also have ISPs that supply high speed.\u201d", "3593 It then lists five telcos, Bell, Ottawa River, Cogeco, NRTC, and Vianet.", "3594 So that seems inconsistent with the difficulties you\u2019ve outlined. So help me understand why these options that are advertised by the City of Pembroke\u2019s website aren\u2019t available to you.", "3595 MR. ADAMS: Okay. I will emphasize my location is inside some of those blue circles that I\u2019ll emphasize. However, my location is six kilometres from a fibre-to-the-home deployment from NRTC. I will emphasize that I am 10 kilometres from Garrison, Petawawa, overall a very large gathering of people.", "3596 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "3597 MR. ADAMS: However, I\u2019ve outlined certain issues with regards to how grant funds have entered into that community. I would argue based on my assessment, did grant funds get pushed into the wrong DSAs?", "3598 I\u2019ve provided you in my reference package six notes.", "3599 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Certainly I understand your issue there, I guess, with this process here and I\u2019m not attempting to diminish that issue at all. But in our process here we\u2019re trying to determine basic needs and affordability and that on a broader scale. So I\u2019m just trying to use a little bit of 360 view on things. So I\u2019m trying to understand where your situation fits into the Community of Pembroke and communities like it and where they\u2019re served.", "3600 So do you have only one option for service?", "3601 MR. ADAMS: Actually I have two, Bell Wireless through what is in effect a turbo hub, or Xplornet. Xplornet ---", "3602 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So none of these others are available, the Ottawa River, Cogeco, NRTC?", "3603 MR. ADAMS: No, they are not. And Xplornet is not, due to the latency, Xplornet Satellite -- it is not Xplornet Wireless -- due to the latency makes it unsuitable for VPN use. The latency -- I\u2019ve had it at home; I had it for one year. It has a latency of over approximately 1,000 milliseconds. So the back and forth time makes it unsuitable.", "3604 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. And the rates Bell charges you are as you\u2019ve described?", "3605 MR. ADAMS: The rates that Bell charges me is what?", "3606 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: As you\u2019ve described?", "3607 MR. ADAMS: Yes. I have described $276 monthly over five years.", "3608 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. How would you have us fix that?", "3609 MR. ADAMS: How would I have you fix that? I\u2019ll note that the Chairman at the beginning has -- I\u2019d like to read out to one of his quotes, a short excerpt of it, with permission, to reemphasize this.", "3610 \u201cThe CRTC therefore issues the following challenge to parties. Demonstrate to us using evidence that the public interest and specific situation in each region justify action by the CRTC. Explain to us why market forces are currently insufficient to respond to the public needs.\u201d", "3611 Well, using evidence I\u2019ve described a set of circumstances that is existing as regard to a previous rollout. I will emphasize the Bell Deferral Accounts fund should be looked at very closely, not just as part of the overall examination of my allegations, but as part of the consideration that the Bell Deferral Accounts fund provided for a basic service objective. In addition, a fund was set aside to provide broadband services.", "3612 Now, in CRTC 2015-134, as part of the review of the basic service objective, you stated that the Commission has never done this. As per my written submissions, I\u2019ve outlined, as part of the Bell Deferral Accounts rollout, in Ontario and Quebec service in that manner was afforded to over 69,000 residences.", "3613 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. So you\u2019ve made your point clear on that. So you are in favour, I take it, of having internet designated as a basic telecommunications service and at an affordable rate.", "3614 So just to focus on that because that\u2019s the main point of our being here, what would you think would be an acceptable rate for the service that you need?", "3615 MR. ADAMS: Comparable to urban rates. I\u2019ve outlined, using evidence ---", "3616 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, so the $64 rate that you referred to?", "3617 MR. ADAMS: Yes. However, I\u2019ve noted that the current plans, the Bell Wireless 5, as part of the Bell Deferral rollouts, comparable to DSL, is $100 more monthly.", "3618 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. No, I understood that; you were very clear on that. ", "3619 Thank you. I don\u2019t have any more questions.", "3620 THE CHAIRPERSON: Have you been living in the area for a long time?", "3621 MR. ADAMS: Five years in the same household.", "3622 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. And did you move there before or after the rollout of the deferral account build-outs or the EORN investments?", "3623 MR. ADAMS: In January 2011. So I got to observe aspects of the rollout as they were being constructed. Obviously there was construction all around my DSA and my neighbourhood, but obviously grant funds never entered my DSA or my neighbourhood.", "3624 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. We heard evidence earlier in the hearing about how access to broadband becomes an important decision point when people decide to move in and it affects as well the value of homes if it is not accessible. So from your perspective, when you moved to the area were you expecting to be able to get broadband?", "3625 MR. ADAMS: Absolutely. I\u2019ve noted that then there was the LVPBI, which I detailed. There was also previously the rural connections, which was I\u2019d say slightly before the decisions in CRTC 210-806 and 210-637. ", "3626 However, I note I didn\u2019t fully understand the whole process at the time. I\u2019ve only conducted research on Ontario, Bell deferral communities, and I\u2019ve chosen to focus on that specifically as part of my submission.", "3627 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. You\u2019re probably not intending to move out of the area, but do you feel that he absence of access to broadband is affecting the desirability of others to move in the area?", "3628 MR. ADAMS: Absolutely. As to the effects on the housing prices, I will note the aspects of people often will shy away from the fact -- when they\u2019re purchasing a house they look at the internet costs. They have to look at every cost. So educated people do that.", "3629 I did look at that before. However, I expected the natural progression of not only market forces in conjunction with government funds to eventually -- I\u2019m so close to where the service is but nobody seems to have an interest in serving my household or my neighbours.", "3630 I will note that either side of my house I can look at neighbours across the streets. There are others affected.", "3631 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So it\u2019s not a high-density area but it\u2019s not, by the same token, a very low-density area?", "3632 MR. ADAMS: No, it is not. And I am very close to Highway 17. I can walk there within a kilometre. You know, this is not a northern community and I understand the challenges of putting service. This is a community close to a built-up area that countless funds have went into, yet here I still am. ", "3633 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. You're obviously frustrated and -- but then again, you prepared very well. You know numbers of our decisions and files better than I do, so congratulations for your preparation and that's commendable, but -- so your participation is very important. We're happy to have given you the opportunity to share a perspective on this issue.", "3634 MR. ADAMS: Thank you. ", "3635 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. ", "3636 I don't think we have any other questions. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "3637 MR. ADAMS: Thank you. ", "3638 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. ", "3639 Madame la secr\u00e9taire.", "3640 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. I will now ask Mr. John Roman to come to the presentation table.", "3641 When you're ready you may begin and you have five minutes. Thank you. ", "PRESENTATION ", "3642 MR. ROMAN: Bonjour. Hello. ", "3643 Commissioners, Chairman, thank you for having me appear before you today. ", "3644 I will focus on only three areas of the several points I raised in my previous submissions: internet access, competition in the mobile internet market, and CRTC forbearance. ", "3645 For Canadians functioning in the global digital economy, the internet is an essential service, regardless of the technology through which it is accessed. Countries with an advanced internet infrastructure are moving to define the internet as a public utility. Without internet access, telecasting services like Netflix or social media are not publicly accessible. ", "3646 To protect our competitive position internationally, it is time to acknowledge that the internet has evolved to become a de facto utility. It must be accessible to all Canadians at a reasonable cost and reasonable speed, regardless of the delivery technology.", "3647 As a means to increase competition, Canadian policy has endorsed increasing the number of companies in the mobile phone market. But competitiveness is not necessarily determined by the number of competitors in the market at a given time; of equal or greater importance is effective competition.", "3648 The barriers to entry to our telecommunications marketplace are high. Apart from is-sues of spectrum availability and infrastructure development, incumbents underprice new entrants by cutting prices in markets other than those that new entrants are entering. That is how Rogers and Bell and the other regional oligopolies compete with new entrants. For example, an incumbent TSP will try to prevent a customer from switching phone service providers by discounting the price of its internet and cable services to compete with Wind. The same would be true of TekSavvy.", "3649 To be clear this isn\u2019t bundling to provide a volume discount, but price discrimination that\u2019s offered only when a customer who already bundles services then wants to switch one service to new, lower-priced entrant.", "3650 This price discrimination is a barrier to new entrants who can't provide as broad a bundle of services. Incumbent TSPs will probably attempt to use the same approach to compete with Virgin and Google when their multinational internet services are launched in 2017 and thereafter. ", "3651 I suggest that it is time for the Commission, in its role as advisor to the government and as regulator, to confront the challenge of constructing a more effectively competitive market for broadband services.", "3652 In 1985, Professor Hudson Janisch proposed a regulatory forbearance policy, the essential elements of which the CRTC has gradually implemented in telecommunications, stepping back from its prior regulatory control as Canada\u2019s telecommunications industry adopted new technologies. ", "3653 In earlier submissions, I proposed ending forbearance and returning to rate regulation. I am now convinced that forbearance is a matter of both degree and kind and can be tailored to meet the needs of different degrees and kinds of competition.", "3654 I propose that the Commission take the four following steps:", "3655 1. Recommend that, in the process of updating the telecommunications and broadcasting legislation, the internet be deemed a public utility.", "3656 2. Rather than expecting TSPs to build optical fibre networks in low-density rural areas, consider encouraging the construction of additional cell towers across the country to allow LTE networks to provide internet service in rural areas. If the TSPs were then to provide rural cell plans that offered unlimited data, customers could tether their phones to their computers and access the internet at much improved speeds. This would both reduce TSP infrastructure costs and provide most of Canada with first-rate cellular network (and Internet) coverage.", "3657 3. The current degree of forbearance unduly favours large incumbents to the marked disadvantage of consumers. The Commission should consider allowing price competition only in similar markets: broadband internet to broadband internet, cell phone to cell phone, et cetera.", "3658 4. The Commission should also reconsider its policy of forbearance with respect to the terms of service contracts in telecommunications. Consider eliminating mandatory arbitration clauses, the main benefit of which is to prevent class-action law suits. Consumers should be able to choose whether to arbitrate or to litigate but, because everyone in the industry has a mandatory arbitration clause, consumers are deprived of that option.", "3659 Those are all my recommendations. ", "3660 At this time, I'd be happy to answer any of your questions. ", "3661 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. ", "3662 Commissioner MacDonald to start us off. ", "3663 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good morning. I do have a few questions.", "3664 Over the hearing so far, we've been talking a lot about the question of needs versus wants, and this is a hearing about basic service. And I guess I'd like to understand how you use the internet and what types of applications that you would want to run over the internet or access over the internet that form a basic need, in your particular circumstance, versus what some may argue would be nice to have, such as others have cited, you know, Netflix or gaming or what have you. ", "3665 So could you speak to that for a bit?", "3666 MR. ROMAN: Thank you. Well, first and foremost, I live in downtown Toronto, so I have access to speeds that others that we've seen before us earlier don't. ", "3667 And in that regard, I'm spoiled for choice when to what I want to do. If I want to watch Netflix on my phone while I'm reading the news or playing a video game, I can do all of those things at the same time. ", "3668 As for other uses that I have for it, I do mainly communications globally through VoIP services, mainly in the UK to discuss legal matters with other people I went to law school with.", "3669 But I don\u2019t use it largely for business. I use it largely for recreation, so as to necessary means for education, it's for research for hearings and that's more or less it. ", "3670 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: And you mentioned -- and thank you for clarifying that you live in downtown Toronto -- that sort of changes the set of lenses a little bit. ", "3671 You had mentioned that we should be looking, not necessarily towards expensive fibre rollouts in rural or remote areas and focusing more on wireless technology. Others we've heard in the hearing have been citing downtown Toronto with the degree of choice and bandwidth options that you have as the rationale as to why they should have fibre. ", "3672 Can you speak to that a little bit?", "3673 MR. ROMAN: I'm not trying to say that those options that the rest of the country should want aren't necessarily desirable. I just fully expect that when Rogers and Bell and other TSPs come before you, they're going to try and find ways to suggest that things are too costly to put fibre into every square kilometre of Canada. ", "3674 So if we're looking for a stopgap measure, which isn't necessarily ideal, but as something I wanted to propose an option. Is it the best option out there? Possibly no. If Bell wanted to divert 10 percent of their net profits or 10 percent of their 10 percent of their net profits to infrastructure development for nation building in Canada, I would certainly be in favour of that. That being said, they're always going to come saying that their purse is, unfortunately, empty. ", "3675 I happen to know Canadians who live in Northern Ontario, in rural in Northern Ontario, who don\u2019t have access to anything other than a cell phone. But because the plans are sort of prohibitive for unlimited data, they simply can't tether and use the internet as they'd like. They have to pick and choose regardless. But they still have cell access, so at least that way there's -- the internet is provided through cell phones and through broadband in home. So as long as we can one form of internet access at reasonable speeds, like LTE, to the home, there is still internet access. And I was trying to find a way to meet that need. ", "3676 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay, thank you. You also mention and support CRTC rate regulation for broadband services. Can you describe to me what that would look like? Do you see us regulating every speed option, every package in every geography, do you see us implementing a basic entry level package at a certain price? What form would you like to see that take?", "3677 MR. ROMAN: Well, there's a couple of definitions of rate regulation in and of itself. There\u2019s rate of return regulation which allows a company to attract equity investors and accrued debt because they know they\u2019ll still be taking profit in, but not taking in so much profit that it necessarily contributes to a deficit for consumers as opposed to regulated rates which will be like payphones where it doesn't matter what the rate is, it's a point of access.", "3678 I'm not quite sure which would be better at this point. If it's deemed to be utility like other telecommunications are, then rate regulated for basic accessibility would seem prudent if expensive and I'm sure TSPs wouldn\u2019t appreciate it. On the other hand, rate of return regulation is something to be considered. Now what volume, that's something for experts who have a great deal of stats such as the CRTC to figure out.", "3679 However, the option is one that should necessarily be on the table. Whether or not it's chosen, ultimately that's up to you.", "3680 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Are you at all concerned that if we took any steps to regulate the rates that service providers can charge that that may stifle their investment in their networks, either bringing new service speeds into markets they already serve or building out their facilities into unserved and underserved areas of the country?", "3681 MR. ROMAN: Not particularly but there's a few reasons for that. One, I don\u2019t think the rate regulation, if it was to happen, would be such that no one would be able to make a profit. I don\u2019t think that will be the goal of anyone in the industry. There is competition unless there's a monopoly, in which case it will be necessary anyway.", "3682 That being said, we've seen with -- I don\u2019t remember what case number it was -- but where Bell put in infrastructure in Etobicoke just outside of Toronto and TekSavvy wanted access to the wholesale line so that they could then compete with Bell. And you ruled that they would have to allow access and Bell instantly went and fought it to the courts, which of course is their right to do. But on the other hand, they're going to fight what's happening no matter what. They're going to claim no matter what. There's no reason to build new infrastructure if anything regulatory happens.", "3683 So it's a matter of saying you're going to cry wolf no matter what. The question is what's best for consumers at this point and I think we've seen, at least so far, from a number of groups that there's a lack of effective competition and infrastructure anyway.", "3684 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Many people are unhappy with the rates that service providers charge. Many people are unhappy with the price of things in general in this day and age. ", "3685 If we did take steps to control rates in some way, should that be to the benefit of everyone or should we take a special focus on low-income Canadians to ensure that they have access to the digital world?", "3686 MR. ROMAN: I noticed that Rogers recently just offered a new plan for low-income Canadians in one urban centre. I'm not sure. It may have been Toronto in fact where it was a very heavily discounted basic internet service. I don\u2019t know whether or not there will be a rate regulation or not or a specific service the CRTC is looking to do. There will be a sort of starter package for internet and while that's something to consider, but I would take away from the let's talk TV hearings and the follow-up that the TSPs aren't really interested in doing anything other than, one, lining pockets and, two, sticking it to the CRTC when it comes to any new regulations.", "3687 When it comes to actually trying to meet the needs of low-income Canadians, they are the most vulnerable and, of course, we have to do everything possible to encourage their access to not just media but communications.", "3688 That being said, you might be not necessarily low income but in a rural area and have similar problems of connecting to the internet. So in that regard, I think it's everyone and low income but I know that's not really an ideal answer and I apologize.", "3689 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just one final question and it comes to wireline phone services and you mentioned I believe one of the uses that you use your internet connection for is doing VoIP.", "3690 We know that approximately one in five Canadians have already cut the cord on traditional wireline phone services. And can you speak to their continued importance or is broadband now king and everything can go through that one pipe and that's where the focus and any potential funding should be directed?", "3691 MR. ROMAN: Well, I'm on the upper end of the millennial scale. So I've never had a wireline for home phone. It's always been cell phones because there's been no need.", "3692 That being said, I don\u2019t know about the privacy laws in this country versus America where -- because cell phones are public space, you don\u2019t need a warrant. I don\u2019t know what the rules are there. If there's a difference between wireless and wired, then there would be reasons to still keep them around. As well as in cases of emergency, wireline is certainly more useful because if there's a power outage, most cell phones tend to be less than successful.", "3693 That being said, for everyone I know of my generation, no one has a home phone anymore. I don\u2019t know whether that's necessarily because they just think they are modded or because we can do everything conveniently enough through cell phones and broadband. But between the two, I would say that you're going to see diminishing returns on any wireline infrastructure.", "3694 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Thank you very much. Those are my questions.", "3695 THE CHAIRPERSON: Not so much a question, it's just a final comment. I notice you have a recommendation about the content of the telecommunications and broadcasting legislation. That's really not our bailiwick. So you'll have to knock on other doors for that. We just implement what Parliament has asked us to implement.", "3696 MR. ROMAN: Okay.", "3697 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your participation.", "3698 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "3699 LA SECR\u00c9TAIRE: Merci.", "3700 We will now hear the presentation of Xplornet Communications Inc. They have switched place with Telesat Inc. So please come to the presentation table.", "3701 When you are ready, please introduce yourself and your colleagues and you have 15 minutes for your presentation.", "PRESENTATION ", "3702 MR. LENEHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, Commission staff.", "3703 My name is Allison Lenehan and I am the President and CEO of Xplornet Communications. Joining me today are: C.J. Prudham, Executive Vice President, General Counsel; Tim Dinesen, Executive Vice President, Network; James Maunder, Director of Government and Regulatory Affairs; and Laurie Dunbar, partner of Fasken\u2019s.", "3704 We are delighted to be here representing Xplornet, Canada\u2019s leading rural internet service provider. My comments today will address who we are and how we believe Xplornet can contribute to meeting the Commission\u2019s objectives.", "3705 Xplornet was founded over 10 years ago with a simple mission: to make affordable, robust broadband available to every rural Canadian. This is what drives us. We want rural Canadians, wherever they choose to live in our vast country, to be able to connect to what matters to them in the digital world.", "3706 We have grown to be the largest rural internet service provider by focusing exclusively on areas of Canada not served by wired solutions.", "3707 Our customers are in every province and territory. While some live in the most remote locations of our country, most of our customers are just outside major urban cities.", "3708 By offering fast and reliable internet services at prices comparable to what Canadians pay in the largest cities, Xplornet has grown to over 300,000 customers and today is the eighth largest in Canada based on number of subscribers, surpassing SaskTel and MTS.", "3709 While we have come a long way, we know there is still much work ahead of us to continuously improve the internet experience of rural Canadians, now and in the future.", "3710 The focus of this hearing is what constitutes a basic telecommunications service. The Commission is asking how to equip all Canadians, regardless of where they live, with the tools to succeed in today\u2019s digital world.", "3711 All parties to this hearing agree that the internet plays a major role in advancing both the social and economic well-being of Canadians. Xplornet strongly agrees.", "3712 If we agree that internet access should be a basic telecommunications service, the Commission must define what comprises this basic service. In doing so, it must differentiate between what is \u201cbasic\u201d and what is an \u201cadvanced broadband\u201d.", "3713 Xplornet believes email, electronic banking, software updates, being able to search for educational or health information, and the ability to access government services, form the basis of what defines basic service.", "3714 These activities are all supported with a connection of 5 megabits per second, and should be considered part of basic internet access.", "3715 The Commission\u2019s 2011 target of 5 megabits per second download and 1 megabit per second upload should now be considered the basic service level.", "3716 Conversely, playing real-time video games, or, replacing your TV service with video streaming, are \u201cwants\u201d and not \u201cneeds\u201d. Canadians want these services. As an industry, we are investing to meet this market demand. But they are not a necessity.", "3717 Has the industry made the basic service available to all Canadians?", "3718 Ten years ago, this Commission and most of the industry believed that rural broadband would only happen if we forced the telephone companies to extend their wires with large subsidies. Even five years ago, many doubted the Commission\u2019s target of 5 megabits per second was even possible in rural and remote areas of Canada.", "3719 They were wrong. Canada\u2019s low population density outside urban areas presents challenges to our shared goal of connecting all Canadians. Yet today virtually all Canadians, 99 percent, have access to an internet connection.", "3720 Does that access meet the proposed basic service level? Based on the Commission\u2019s 2014 data, excluding satellites, 96 percent of all Canadians, and including 86 percent of rural Canadians, had access to internet speeds of at least 5 megabits per second.", "3721 When you include the satellites that are delivering 5 megabits per second or faster speeds, there were less than 180,000 rural households that did not have 5 megabits available in 2014.", "3722 But the internet is not static -- excuse me -- the industry is not static. Given all of the private investment since 2014, and the building of networks under the Connecting Canadians program, we believe that number is much smaller today.", "3723 How did we collectively achieve this remarkable result in a country that is the second largest land mass in the world and has just four people per square kilometer?", "3724 It took innovation, it took courage, and it took the entrepreneurial spirit of over 500 ISPs that entered the marketplace to serve Canadians, particularly in rural communities.", "3725 As an industry, we looked for technologies that could provide good service, cost effectively in rural areas. At Xplornet, we started with 3G wireless and satellite technologies. In 2010, the best we could do was 1.5 megabits per second of download speed, and the customer had to pay $400 upfront for equipment. We knew we had to do more.", "3726 When we appeared before this Commission in 2010, we were excited to talk about the new WiMAX fixed wireless technology and the two new high throughput satellites launching in 2011 that would change the game. We could offer customers speed packages of up to 10 megabits per second and data up to 60 GB per month. This drove down costs, reduced monthly fees and eliminated upfront equipment charges.", "3727 But again, as the internet continued to evolve, we knew more needed to be done. We work with suppliers from around the world to create leading edge technology for the delivery of rural broadband. In fact, in 2011 Xplornet was the first company in North America and only the second in the world to test LTE in the 3500 GHz frequency band for fixed wireless deployment.", "3728 We are here today equally excited with the new LTE fixed wireless service we started rolling out last year, and the two new high throughput satellites launching within the next 12 months.", "3729 We will make available to rural Canadians speed packages of up to 25 megabits per second with data of 250 GB per month, at affordable prices.", "3730 However, we know we can do more for our consumers. We are currently testing fixed wireless technology that will make speeds of 100 megabits per second possible for rural Canadians.", "3731 Similarly, a new terabyte satellite was just announced, with more capacity than all current commercial satellites in the world, combined. It can deliver speeds of 100 megabits per second to the consumer and will be launching in 2019. That is only three years away.", "3732 In total, Xplornet has spent over $1 billion in the last 5 years bringing improved technology and better service to rural Canadians. We expect to continue making significant investments in our network. And Xplornet is just one of hundreds of rural ISPs.", "3733 Truly, anywhere in Canada, Canadians can today and will in the future be able to fully participate in the digital world in ways we would have never anticipated just five short years ago.", "3734 Now, there is an opportunity for the Commission to embrace a new role that guides innovation, and improves competition, for the benefit of all Canadians. That can start with establishing bold new speed targets for broadband internet access in Canada.", "3735 Canada should aspire to do more than the 5 megabits per second basic service. We believe that the Commission should set a target speed of 25 megabits per second as a new aspirational goal by 2020.", "3736 We anticipate components of the basic service, like e-health and e-learning, will evolve to incorporate video content, and utilize increasingly larger amounts of bandwidth in the future.", "3737 We believe a 25 megabits per second target is entirely within Canada\u2019s reach, and we encourage the Commission to set this new target, this new progressive target, while using a light regulatory touch that will foster innovation by Canadian companies to achieve more for consumers.", "3738 However, to meet the \u201cwants\u201d of our customers, we need to deliver beyond the basic service. Xplornet is aiming higher. Our goal is to deliver 100 megabits per second by 2020 to rural Canadians and we challenge all rural ISPs to do the same.", "3739 To achieve these bold targets in the future, Xplornet believes Canada needs to continue to make use of the most cost-efficient technologies capable of delivering robust internet service.", "3740 Our best-fit technology approach is not unique. The United States has a similar multi-technology approach. Despite the much higher population densities, approximately 1.7 million Americans subscribe to internet service via satellite, and millions more subscribe to fixed wireless service.", "3741 In Australia, the Government\u2019s National Broadband Network set out to connect eight million Australians households with at least 25 megabits per second, at an estimated cost of $42 billion. Even with such an incredible budget, the Government of Australia\u2019s plan called for a multi-technology mix approach deploying fibre, 4G LTE fixed wireless, and two satellites to connect everyone across the large Australian land mass. By 2020, after a significant fiber build is complete, the 25 megabits per second service will be delivered to 7 percent of its households by fixed wireless and 3 percent by satellite.", "3742 Our technology and coverage approach is similar in Canada. However, we will achieve the same 25 megabits service with significantly less burden on the taxpayers because most of the Canadian networks have been built using private capital with relatively modest, targeted participation by the different levels of government.", "3743 We would be remiss if we did not briefly address obstacles to connecting all Canadians to a world-class communications system.", "3744 The first is spectrum. While Xplornet believes the basic service is available today to all Canadians, the biggest obstacle to improving the level of service beyond what is available today is not access to capital or infrastructure, it is access to spectrum.", "3745 Consumer demand for speed and more data, combined with more devices per household connected to the internet, requires that all companies, including Xplornet, have timely access to spectrum.

Basic internet service can be available, but it does not mean all Canadians will choose to connect.", "3750 Approximately 6 percent of Canadians have indicated they are not connected, because they do not see the relevance of the internet to their lives or they lack the skills needed to use it.", "3751 Similarly, nearly 3 percent of Canadians are connected because of affordability issues.", "3752 Xplornet believes digital education can and will by far be more impactful in connecting more Canadians than additional funding for infrastructure.", "3753 To address affordability, a policy of an income-based subsidy is the most efficient way to target individuals who cannot afford access to the internet.

We believe a new CRTC subsidy program would curtail private investment, discourage innovation and dampen competition. None of these outcomes would be helpful.", "3759 In summary, Xplornet shares the Commission\u2019s goal of ensuring all Canadians have access to a world-class communications system that promotes innovation and enriches their lives.", "3760 We believe 5 megabits per second by 1 megabit per second should be the basic service today.", "3761 The Commission\u2019s decision in 2011 to set a target of 5 megabits per second inspired the industry to innovate and improve service without technology limitations, and worked to motivate all of us to deliver on that goal.", "3762 Given the Commission\u2019s success in setting targets instead of regulation or subsidies, we encourage you to again set an aspirational target of 25 megabits per second to meet the basic service needs of Canadians in 2020.", "3763 We also challenge our industry, including ourselves, to reach higher to at least 100 megabits per second to meet the wants of Canadians in 2020.", "3764 Instead of looking to the past for antiquated programs or duplication of funding, we urge the Commission to reimagine its role with a bold new vision of what the internet means to Canadians in the next five years.", "3765 We believe this new framework of new targets and progressive government policies can deliver unprecedented innovation in the years ahead of us.", "3766 Thank you for time today and we would be pleased to receive your questions.", "3767 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Commissioner Molnar will start us off.", "3768 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So good morning. I remember five years ago or so, when Xplornet came before us the last time we looked at this issue and, you know, there was -- there was great promise and it sounded like all was solved and it does again and in a way it is.", "3769 There\u2019s certainly been a lot of progress in the last five years and it is good to see the focus on rural and remote areas that is the focus of your company.", "3770 So I want to get a little better of an understanding first about what you provide today. And I know there\u2019s a -- there\u2019s really quite a clear distinction between the wireless and the satellite. ", "3771 So as I ask my questions maybe if you wouldn\u2019t mind responding in that vein so we understand well the difference between the wireless delivery versus the satellite and what those issues might be.", "3772 And if I ask questions that you feel require a confidential response, you can indicate that it\u2019s confidential and undertake to deliver? Okay, thanks. ", "3773 So just in understanding where you are today, I believe that you have placed on the record and in confidential filing the number of customers you serve and the number of customers you\u2019re capable of serving today?", "3774 MR. LENEHAN: Yes, that\u2019s part of the materials we submitted.", "3775 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right and so did that include both from a satellite and a fixed wireless perspective?", "3776 MS. PRUDHAM: I don\u2019t believe we provide the fixed wireless information because that\u2019s a constantly evolving network, so it\u2019s --", "3777 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right and it is ---", "3778 MS. PRUDHAM: -- a little hard.", "3779 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Is it limited in any way by your access to spectrum today, to limit the number of customers you may be able to serve?", "3780 MS. PRUDHAM: I think that\u2019s better -- Tim?", "3781 MR. DINESEN: Yes, in order for us to make the investments in any fixed wireless infrastructure we do need to have access to licence spectrum preferably. That gives us the longer term ability to make that investment and secure the fact that we can get customers.", "3782 Certainly we prefer it in some cases. We use -- we occupy unlicensed spectrum but short answer to your question is yes availability of licence spectrum is a consideration for us to make investments in fixed wireless networks.", "3783 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So just so I understand, you\u2019re actually not limited but you would be using unlicensed versus licensed spectrum?", "3784 MR. DINESEN: Depends on the area. Our strong preference -- and this is no different from even the guys offering mobility services, but our strong preference is to have access to licensed spectrum.", "3785 We do have cases in some areas where we occupy unlicensed or quasi-license spectrum.", "3786 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "3787 MS. PRUDHAM: Just to clarify, an example would be some place -- like and I understand you\u2019re hearing from them later today, would be the area of Milton, which is within the Toronto license area. ", "3788 The Toronto license is not available to the fixed wireless providers. That is an area where there\u2019s more than one, in fact we\u2019re aware of at least three providers in that area that are trying to share the 50 megahertz of lite license 365. ", "3789 So that\u2019s obviously a limiting constraint for everyone involved there.", "3790 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Before I go on with my questions about your plans and so on, on the issue of spectrum and you acknowledge that it is an issue.", "3791 You know it\u2019s administered by what was Industry Canada, would you see any role for the Commission or anything that we could do to facilitate business -- you know, kind of business problems that you\u2019re facing in getting that spectrum deployed?", "3792 MS. PRUDHAM: Well we would certainly ask the Commission to encourage the former Industry Canada --I\u2019m not sure what the formal name is now; it\u2019s quite a mouthful -- Innovation Science and Economic Development, to take into consideration fixed wireless when doing their allocations of spectrum.", "3793 There\u2019s been a lot of spectrum made available for mobile purposes and there\u2019s been a lot of publicity around the auctions, but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of focus or consideration given to the fixed wireless side, so any encouragement that you could offer to them would be greatly appreciated. ", "3794 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So speaking of your service that you offer today, and I think you put on the record your service plans, I\u2019ve seen something about residential. Do you have separate and distinct plans for business? ", "3795 MR. LENEHAN: We do serve small business, but frankly in terms of medium or large enterprise that is not the current focus of our deployment. ", "3796 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And you have separate plans or you just have ---?", "3797 MR. LENEHAN: For the small to medium size? Yes, predominantly the speeds are not materially different. ", "3798 We may adjust an upload speed, because they tend to require perhaps more upload, but by and large it usually is wrapped around services. ", "3799 So response times and so on for a business, because they simply -- if they are down with their internet they need very timely response to keep their business operating, so we tend to wrap services around those for home and small businesses. That\u2019s the primary difference.", "3800 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You wrap service level guarantees; is that what you\u2019re saying?", "3801 MR. LENEHAN: We do provide higher level of prioritisation of services, yes. ", "3802 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Oh so you prioritize their service?", "3803 MR. LENEHAN: Yes.", "3804 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Would they have higher data caps?", "3805 MR. LENEHAN: By and large they\u2019re similar. And if you\u2019d like I can tell you what our new services are. But I think you\u2019d find that the speeds and data caps for them generally would meet most small and medium businesses. And frankly for us, we tend to find that while it\u2019s a residence that we\u2019re serving, in a lot of cases the residence is used as a place of office. So sometimes we need to determine what they are attempting to do and then adjust their packages accordingly. And typically that results in perhaps higher speeds but certainly a review of what their data consumption may be.", "3806 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So when you say that you provide service-level guarantees or perhaps not guarantees but you provide service parameters separate for business than residential, are you able to prioritize traffic by customer? Is that what you\u2019re doing?", "3807 MR. LENEHAN: That is not what I\u2019m referring to. I\u2019ll let C.J., if you wish, talking about traffic. But no, I\u2019m talking more about -- you\u2019ll see when it comes to business versus home you\u2019ll tend to find slight differences on service levels in terms of prioritization of installation or repair that may occur for the location. That\u2019s what I mean by services, not the actual internet access part but more around the service and support around it.", "3808 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I see. Thank you.", "3809 MR. DINESEN: If I can just add, Madam Commissioner, just by way of illustration. A small retail store that requires our service to do things like point-of-sale transactions, if they\u2019re down for too long then they\u2019re out of business for the day. So in terms of elevated ---", "3810 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Fair enough. So you\u2019re talking mean time to repair and that sort of thing.", "3811 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah, that\u2019s correct.", "3812 MR. DINESEN: Correct.", "3813 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you.", "3814 Yesterday SSi was in front of us and speaking of how they were challenged to create plans for the customers, you know, kind of a bit of arithmetic around how do you balance speed and capacity and the number of customers and so on. ", "3815 Can you tell me how you go about doing that? I mean, you\u2019re essentially in the same situation in the finite capacity of the satellite and the number of customers you might serve. Can you tell me how it is you go about determining what is your pricing plan, your offer to the customer?", "3816 MR. LENEHAN: It\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to SSi or Xplornet. I do believe it\u2019s typically just globally a broadband situation, when it comes to a significant amount of demand and supply, trying to keep pace with that demand. I think as an industry we continue to try to deal with that.", "3817 And it\u2019s a great question. The best way I can answer it on how we continue to evolve our packages and how we determine our short-term supply, is based on customer feedback. And generally speaking, for us, we\u2019re a growth company. So if we don\u2019t respond to what customers want then ultimately we\u2019re not growing. ", "3818 So we try to take and incorporate what they\u2019re asking and try to combine speed and data and keep it within an affordable price and try to find the right balance for them. But it is an ongoing art form that we all have to figure out on how to combine right packages to attract our marketplace. ", "3819 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And so it\u2019s based on customer input?", "3820 MR. LENEHAN: Yes, I\u2019d say.", "3821 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: One of the ---", "3822 MR. LENEHAN: Sorry.", "3823 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: One of the things we find in these proceedings is something customers who are engaged will participate, right? They\u2019re perhaps frustrated with some levels of their service. And the large majority of customers maybe don\u2019t engage with us. And so we don\u2019t always get the same customer or, you know, consumer kind of feedback that you might.", "3824 I wonder, do you have information around your customer feedback that you could share with us, kind of how you collect that information? How is it you\u2019re collecting the information from your customers to determine that you\u2019re in fact creating plans that meet their needs?", "3825 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah, great question.", "3826 When I say customer I\u2019m talking two groups. Think of it as current customers, and all I\u2019ll talk about how we continually collect current customer feedback, and then of course prospective customers, which is very dynamic. You may not see it in rural but we see it with hundreds of competitors that we face. And unfortunately they\u2019re not all national brands so you can easily figure out what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them are very local or regional-based. So you have to be very dynamic in responding.", "3827 So we have two sets. The first is, and I\u2019ll start with the prospective one. The prospective one is very market-forces driven. So if we are not succeeding very well in growing in a particular area, we tend to evaluate why. And we evaluate just like any other marker would. We tend to evaluate how we can create packages that meet the needs of the marketplace as well as compete with other providers.", "3828 The cool thing about this business is that with current customers and a growing base you have real-time feedback and it really is real time. We have two 24-hour-a-day, 365-day-a-year technical care centres that receive your call. And they will receive them with email or phone call or any other form of communication, all the new social media. We get a lot of interaction with our customer base.", "3829 So we continually receive that feedback, including typically what they want. And I would tell you with great certainty they continue to want more product, which we then try to breakdown exactly what they\u2019re asking for -- which is important -- exactly what they\u2019re asking for and then adjust our packages accordingly.", "3830 So one of the great things about the broadband industry is that it is fairly real time and this isn\u2019t always the good part because you don\u2019t always get the good call. But we get a lot of feedback on our customers. We take that and we poll them from a research perspective to try to find out what they want now. ", "3831 But also, as you can imagine, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll ask questions about this, it\u2019s not about today because internet is evolving fairly quickly. So we need to keep pace with not what necessarily they want today because the infrastructure takes time to deploy. You need to collect that information and then in fact plan ahead in terms of what they will want in the future. So that is a lot of the input process both on current and prospective, if that\u2019s helpful. ", "3832 Anything I missed?", "3833 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I promise I will talk about the future.", "3834 MR. LENEHAN: Yes.", "3835 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But I just have a few questions about today first if that\u2019s okay?", "3836 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah, certainly.", "3837 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: One of my other questions about today, and I appreciate you say, you know, you\u2019re polling your customers and meeting their needs. Would you undertake to provide us information on your residential price plans? For each of your plans with the bandwidth limits and data caps that are there, what percentage of your customers reach their data cap each month?", "3838 MS. PRUDHAM: We will provide that undertaking; we have that information.", "3839 ", "UNDERTAKING", "3840 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. It\u2019s not been provided on the record to date?", "3841 MS. PRUDHAM: I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve previously been asked but we\u2019d be delighted to provide it.", "3842 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. And on your plans, remind me, are customers able to purchase additional capacity? Or are they throttled once they hit their ---", "3843 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah. So here\u2019s how ---", "3844 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I asked an \u201cor\u201d.", "3845 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah. If you\u2019d like I can just go with \u201cyes\u201d.", "3846 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Sure. They\u2019re able to purchase additional?", "3847 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah. So the way we package our product is we set packages to try to keep people within a speed, data, and price envelope. And what happen is, as they approach their package they have a choice. And this is on a monthly cycle. They can stay within that package or they can contact us and upgrade their package. Either they can do that just for the balance of the billing cycle or upgrade to a different package with a different speed and data. ", "3848 And we tend to find that is a fairly active activity at the early stage of adding a new customer because typically we find when somebody (inaudible) they don\u2019t really know exactly what they are able to do with the internet once they subscribe to our service. So they tend to take a package they think fits them at the time of activating and then they\u2019ll adjust to what they tend to find fits their needs over a course of a brief period of time. But yes, they do have the ability to purchase more.", "3849 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And can you tell me as well, and if this is long you can undertake to provide this, but what are the tools you provide to your customers so that they can make informed decisions, you know, so they\u2019re not having to hit a capacity cap the first month and then realign and realign? Do you have tools available to them that will help them select the appropriate package?", "3850 MS. PRUDHAM: Yes, we do have online tracking so every customer has a customer activity centre account that allows them to ---", "3851 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But that would only occur once you have made your decision, right? ", "3852 MS. PRUDHAM: Once you have picked a package, yes, and then we do have also on our websites some examples and things like that to give people a sense of where they should be when they start out, and then they can of course, track on a daily basis, exactly what consumption they have. We do have warnings as they start to reach their limits.", "3853 I think one of the key things that we do differently than other companies is that we truly give customers a choice, as Allison alluded to.", "3854 And they have a choice whether it's more important to stay within their budget and at which point there is a fixed price per month and when they reach their data cap the speed slow down at that point or, alternatively, they can choose to buy more so they can have a usage-based billing arrangement if they prefer or, again, the last choice is upgrade.", "3855 We try very hard to ensure that they find the right sized package and the vast majority of our customers stay within their limits and we will provide you with the exact percentage.", "3856 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, very good. And just too so I understand, that's a dynamic decision a customer makes or they make the decision upfront whether they will have?", "3857 Like, can they choose every month whether they add additional data? Is that a one-time decision or they can choose that each month?", "3858 MS. PRUDHOM: Well, they can -- we don't stop people from changing. They can choose when they would like to change. So they can -- we don't encourage them dynamically to change every month but we try to find the right package that fits them. So they don't generally move around too much after ---", "3859 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Let me give an example.", "3860 MS. PRUDHOM: Yeah.", "3861 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Just a simple example. I have used it once before here.", "3862 But Windows 10 came out and everybody hit their limits. It's not something you anticipated going forward. It doesn't happen every month. Perhaps it will go forward but it wasn't supposed to.", "3863 So if somebody hits their limit, they could choose for that month to add additionally?", "3864 MR. LENEHAN: Yes.", "3865 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes.", "3866 MR. LENEHAN: Yes. One of the more active contacts with our customer care centre is, in fact, package changes; up, down, depending on what their need is.", "3867 So, yes, they -- and to your point on -- I think you were asking a question around -- when they first start out with us we try our best to try to, you know without being too pushy on what they are doing, we try to probe what they may want for a speed price/data combination. But as you know, no one quite knows the data side until they start using it in a robust way. So we tend to do, like most industry, we do upfront discount.", "3868 So when you first join, we discount the product to try it and then within that timeframe they tend to have just settled in on what is best for them in the near term. Although I would think over time they will continue -- generally speaking, people will continue to consume more speed and more data. So over time they tend to change their packages.", "3869 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Do you need to make any distinction between speaking of your customers on wireless versus satellite when you -- or you do that with everybody? They get a higher end package going forward and ---", "3870 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah, make sure I say that -- they don't necessarily get a higher impact because sometimes a lot of people start with a lower-priced product and then, not realizing, so the speed works and the price works but they don't quite know how much data they, as a household will consume.", "3871 So they tend to find what fits them and if they are fairly educated they already know, so they kind of pick high or low. So they do kind of self-moderate within a fair period of time.", "3872 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Do you have issues with customers who perhaps have incurred additional data charges and all of a sudden, you know, there is an affordability issue there, an unanticipated, a bill shock if you will or your practice is set up so that doesn't occur?", "3873 MR. LENEHAN: Well, I'd love to tell you we get that right every time. I think we do a pretty good job of that.", "3874 As CJ mentioned, we notify them as frequently as we can and, in fact, to avoid -- and this is a choice we made and sometimes it probably is less good for the business because it results in phone calls.", "3875 But we, when they get to a certain point, even if they haven't noticed the notifications, we will govern their behaviour.", "3876 And then they tend to then call in, which is fine with us but we don't want them to have a billing surprise. So that we manage their expectation as to what their price will be for the balance of the month or if they have chosen a new package to go forward, then we will inform them exactly what that new product is.", "3877 So I don't think there are very many surprises. I wouldn't say there aren't ever, but it would be very minimal.", "3878 MS. PRUDHAM: We could also, in confidence, provide you with the split that consumers have chosen. As we say, they have a choice between whether they want to incur the potential additional charges each month that they happen to go over or receive a fixed plan.", "3879 And we can provide you with the split. We will indicate that most prefer the fixed price approach.", "3880 MR. LENEHAN: Just by way of ---", "3881 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I would also be interested just if you have the information, and I appreciate you are sharing. It would be interesting for those that have chosen not to incur additional charges how many days before they hit their data cap.", "3882 MR. LENEHAN: Just by way of a guiding principle if I may, what we try to engineer into our business is maximum choice for our customers without being controlling in terms of how they use a service and also, to the extent possible, the avoidance of risk of them being surprised with a sticker shock, as you put it.", "3883 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So before we move on to looking at the future, as I promised we would I want to talk to you folks particularly as it regards Nunavut.", "3884 If you listen to, you know, the parties who were before us for the last couple of days, and you know we read your submission here as a satellite service provider that there is lots going on really well in Canada that much of the problems are solved, none of the parties who were here before us were suggesting that kind of an outcome.", "3885 So tell me particularly your participation in that territory.", "3886 MS. PRUDHAM: We do offer service there. We do have a 4G service that offers 5 megabits per second.", "3887 And if I may be so bold, based on our competitive research, we are the fastest and the cheapest in the territory. So we certainly attempt to make available. We do have dealers in that location.", "3888 I can't speak to why people may or may not have opted for our service.", "3889 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Maybe you can't speak on the record for why they have not opted for your service but, I mean, that is clearly a segment of the populations, 18,000, I think, folks that are satellite-dependent. That's a pretty good market base who are underserved today.", "3890 Are you aggressively marketing to them?", "3891 MR. LENEHAN: It's a good question. And so it's not about the future but it's about as a business what we will continue to do for investments. And I won't speak specifically to a particular territory. Just in general in the North a question we tend to ask is that, \"Look, we want to have robust broadband at affordable prices ever in Canada\". That doesn't mean that we are always the best solution.", "3892 The reason I point to that is you will find in the recent Connecting Canada program they have chosen to work with other providers to solve the problem with government subsidy with other providers. So there is only so much as a business.", "3893 I wouldn't want to misrepresent. We, as a private company, want to continue to solve as many customers' needs in rural as we possibly can but if we are chosen not to be that right solution for the North and the government has decided with the program to choose others then we understand.", "3894 What that will do though is limit the amount of investment privately we will make to upgrade the capacity, so the infrastructure to continue to keep pace with what people want to do in that particular area.", "3895 So that's the part that tends not to go unsaid, is that in the North it's not a technical issue in our point of view.", "3896 However, it is an economic point of view and you can imagine for our private investors to invest a significant amount of capital for infrastructure in a particular area only to compete with public capital in that area of a sizeable amount is probably not the best thing for us to do. We should take that capital and deploy it to other parts of the country that are needing more infrastructure investment. So that's what -- a choice we make to do.", "3897 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thanks. And I appreciate that because you know if you read this, it becomes a bit confusing to say, well, there is a technical -- there is a satellite provider who is offering and promising to offer greater and greater speeds at commercial rates without any government investment and we have full communities coming forward saying they need hundreds of millions of investment in -- you know, they're like, scraping by with one and a half megs. And it's -- you know, that's two very different stories. ", "3898 MR. LENEHAN: And if you wouldn't mind -- if it's okay, I think it's really important that investment and infrastructure, as you guys know, is one of the most important parts of this conversation. And we need to continue to figure out a way to keep working together as a general government entities of all levels with private capital to make sure we are deploying the capital efficiently. ", "3899 And what we tend to find is that with the amount of money that's going into the Connecting Canadians in recent years, it's simply not the best idea for us to then overall, you know, spend more in that same area with the same private capital for particular -- to solve, apparently, the same problem if we have other areas of the country that have a similar need. So I really do not believe and we're capable of sharing that with you in greater detail, technically speaking.", "3900 Technology can solve that problem for a significantly less amount of money, but there's a choice to be made and we're not always the answer. I'd love to tell you Xplornet can solve every problem. We think we can, but if it's the choice that is made, then we understand and we'll focus somewhere else. ", "3901 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So very good. Government investment is something you -- well, that you\u2019ve contributed significant private investment. You've also participated in government funding programs in the past; is that true? ", "3902 MR. LENEHAN: Yes, we've participated. I think we -- it's been taxpayer money and it's been appreciated in targeted areas. ", "3903 You may know that it's not something we are advocating because we do think the private capital can solve it, but we do understand that there are particular cases that the government has chosen, whether it's the right decision or not.", "3904 From our perspective, at the end of the day, the government has chosen to do that, and of course, we are, once that decision is made, we'll actively participate in the best way we possibly can. So just as a context, it's been a lot of taxpayer money, but relative to the amount of private capital, it would be a very small percentage of the capital we've deployed. ", "3905 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: If that is not on the public record, could you place on the public record the different programs and amount that you have participated in for public monies? ", "3906 MS. PRUDHAM: I think we responded to an interrogatory and provided a full list of that, but if it's not, we will undertake to provide it. ", "3907 ", "UNDERTAKING", "3908 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. ", "3909 So 2017, your new satellite is up and running and you're able to offer 25-1? ", "3910 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah, we decided that this could be solved, not just with one, but two, so the first one will launch late this year and the second one will launch as late as early the following year, so Q1 of '17; it may be a bit earlier. ", "3911 Both will be commercially operational in 2017 with capacity covering -- think of it as additional layers to our existing infrastructure. We just put two more layers on top of that infrastructure where we focused more capacity to augment what we already have. So yes, both will be launched and available in 2017. ", "3912 MR. DINESEN: And just to complete the question, we'll get additional coverage in addition to our current high throughput satellite fleet. The capacity of these two new satellites, due to come into service next year, will add three times more our existing capacity. So we'll have, coming out the other side of this, approximately four times the satellite capacity that we currently have. ", "3913 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Four times the capacity? So that will both increase -- and you identified that you have plans to increase the size of the plans available to your customers, and I assume that will also increase the number of customers you would be able to serve?", "3914 MR. DINESEN: Yeah, let me check that. ", "3915 MR. LENEHAN: Good question. We're a growth company, so we'll continue to provide service to more customers, but frankly, much of this investment is targeted at current customers. ", "3916 So we do have the ability to continue to grow with more, but you know, the thing about infrastructure and broadband is that if we don\u2019t continue to reinvest in the existing markets for existing customers, based on the feedback we're receiving, then we start to fall behind. And frankly, in some parts of this country for us we have done that. ", "3917 We would like to have just had the satellites up this year, but unfortunately, that's just the timetable available to us. ", "3918 So as we're rolling that out, we're continuing to roll out the LTE, and I know that we tend to get painted with the satellite brush, but we tend to be as big, if not bigger, in fixed wireless than we are in satellite. So we tend to target our fixed wireless capacity, not just for existing areas, so we're upgrading where we already have, but we're expanding that footprint. ", "3919 A lot of what we do is we target it to areas where we have seen unanticipated demands that satellite has identified and then we deploy fixed wireless in that area which then, frankly, think of it as it's harmonious for us because then we can re-deploy that satellite capacity to other parts of the region. ", "3920 So it's not like we're waiting to '17 to continue to provide a lot of capacity, but in terms of our ability to say to all of our customers, to be able to solve each of their problems, then we will need to be '17 before we kind of complete our task on infrastructure investment.", "3921 But it's mainly, initially targeted at current customers, because they are telling us they want more, and we are happy to provide it to them as we go. But we definitely have a lot more capacity available in both our wireless and satellite networks to grow further. ", "3922 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. Just speaking of the LTE, it is -- would be -- from a customer perspective, would there be a noticeable service difference between being on the LTE network versus on the satellite network? ", "3923 MR. DINESEN: Yes, in very general terms. LTE is a relatively new technology to us. We're taking a mobile tier one standard technology and applying it to fixed wireless. Compare that to our existing satellite fleet, which was designed four or five years ago. The speed difference will be noticeable for customers who are buying an LTE package, which is 25 megabits up to 500 gigabytes of download per month versus a typical satellite package for us. ", "3924 With the next generation of satellites that are going to launch in 2017, our objective is to harmonize those products, so there shouldn\u2019t be that much of a noticeable difference, either in terms of speed or in data allocations. ", "3925 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So very good. So you could get an equivalent speed on either one? You could get an equivalent data cap? Are there other issues, such as latency or others that would make it noticeable to a customer what service they're riding on?", "3926 MR. DINESEN: So first part, correct on product. Our goal is to harmonize the product specifications. ", "3927 Latency, as defined by the time required for a signal to make its way through any transmission path, the satellite platform will still be subject to the same latency that all geo-stationary satellites have. And there will be still that remaining difference between fixed wireless and satellite in that regard. ", "3928 Its impact to service, however, as far as a customer is concerned, really depends on the type of application they're using. Latency is more noticeable for things that require real-time transactions, such as online gaming or auctions or bidding, but is not noticeable at all for things like streaming video or typical browsing-type activity. ", "3929 MR. LENEHEN: Could I just add a few, if you wouldn't mind, because this is a topical one, if that's okay, to say think (inaudible) want to take the -- all of the what people are doing and want to shrink down the -- what's still at issue, just within the satellite network to latency, and I think you'll hear during this hearing, a couple of different companies, be it Telesat or OneWeb or others, that are even working to solve that technical issue on satellite, perhaps before the decade is out. ", "3930 So it's not that we're foregoing that and as a concession of defeat on a technical limitation, whether that's with our wireless network where we don\u2019t have the latency or whether it's a couple of the other satellite folks that will come before you. ", "3931 We are not forgetting our Canadian customers. We are very focused on solving that. It's just one that takes a little more time before we would rest. ", "3932 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I want to ask about voice, given we're talking about latency here. You offer a voice product over your wireless network?", "3933 MR. LENEHAN: So good question. First is --- ", "3934 COMMISIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. ", "3935 MR. LENEHAN: --- that we -- yeah, it's a really good -- thank you. I should have asked you to ask that. ", "3936 First, as an internet protocol company, we carry voice traffic. We see it on satellite, we see on wireless of lots of providers. So that is happening and we are very happy to do that. ", "3937 And it's significant on satellite too. It's not just fixed wireless. ", "3938 However, recently, we\u2019ve also introduced our own product that will be using our facilities; that is a very reliable home phone service, and here we\u2019re not reinventing the phone. It\u2019s a good phone in Canada.", "3939 But in rural Canada -- and I think you\u2019ve had people talk about this -- in rural Canada -- everyone has kind of moved on in urban from the pricing around phone.", "3940 In rural remote, it\u2019s still a significant price consideration. I won\u2019t quote what the prices are. You folks know them very well.", "3941 Our home phone product over both, satellite and wireless, will be $20. That is for local calling across the province, all the feature sets, and a quality of service connection for your home phone. That is what we\u2019re rolling out as we speak in most provinces and we\u2019ll have it out for all before the end of this year.", "3942 And like I said, it\u2019s not just wireless, it\u2019s across all of our satellite.", "3943 So did I miss anything there?", "3944 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And if we were to look at the technical -- no, \u201ctechnical parameters\u201d is not the correct term. But as a customer, if I was to utilize your product over satellite or over wireless, would I be able to notice the difference from what I would -- from a fixed landline?", "3945 MR. DINESEN: So you\u2019re making the combination, and I think it\u2019s an intuitive one, between latency and the perception of the effect of that ---", "3946 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I\u2019m trying not to speak of the technical because I\u2019ll get over my own head very quickly.", "3947 MR. DINESEN: Right.", "3948 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And just say from a customer experience perspective, how would it differ?", "3949 MR. DINESEN: So cognitively, in terms of how you interface with the product, there is a difference between fixed wireless and satellite.", "3950 On satellite -- the way I categorize it is to say it\u2019s not -- it doesn\u2019t perform like landline or you don\u2019t perceive it like landline to the extent that you can\u2019t talk over each other. But it\u2019s no worse than what we\u2019re conditioned to experience when we make a mobile call.", "3951 So there is a bit of -- a bit of talk and then wait and then get a response, but it\u2019s not something that a typical voice consumer isn\u2019t currently conditioned to expect. ", "3952 It\u2019s not -- from our point of view and what the customers are telling us, it\u2019s not an impediment to them purchasing and using the product.", "3953 MS. PRUDHAM: And you have to keep in mind that even what we call the \u201clandlines\u201d have been using satellite to provide long distance since 1962.", "3954 So what we think of as landlines are in fact carried over satellite for telephone purposes.", "3955 So it\u2019s the same experience from that perspective when you\u2019re talking about using a VoIP product on satellite.", "3956 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. The VoIP product over satellite in making a long distance call, not a call within the community ---", "3957 MR. LENEHAN: Yes.", "3958 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- there\u2019s additional latency within the community.", "3959 MR. LENEHAN: Yes.", "3960 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes, okay.", "3961 You have proposed that the Commission should eliminate the existing subsidy for voice services?", "3962 MS. PRUDHAM: Yes, that was our proposal.", "3963 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Based on the fact that solutions such as yours -- or there is alternatives, low-cost solutions?", "3964 MS. PRUDHAM: Yes. We\u2019ve certainly seen a very large growth of the mobile networks. They cover 99 percent of the population, and there are, as we indicated, VoIP services, not only ours but many others available to people.", "3965 So it\u2019s increasingly -- other alternatives are there to provide the need.", "3966 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So where there is no alternative, would you still believe that we should eliminate it or your view is you\u2019re an alternative everywhere and therefore where competition exists there should be no subsidies and, I mean ---", "3967 MS. PRUDHAM: Yes, that\u2019s our view. Because of the ubiquitous footprint of the satellite, there\u2019s no unserved area in terms of being able to reach a VoIP solution.", "3968 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm. I might have to go and just refresh myself but it was my sense, as I remember, that actually voice subsidies are not available where there is forbearance, where competition exists.", "3969 So if there is viable competition, maybe that just solves itself, if it\u2019s viable -- if there\u2019s a viable voice option out there available to all customers in the region.", "3970 MS. PRUDHAM: Admittedly we are not really an expert in this area. So that\u2019s our understanding as well.", "3971 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And you\u2019re thinking that you have a viable option here that should be considered or will soon?", "3972 MS. PRUDHAM: Yes or facilitate viable options by providing the internet connection that other VoIP services can run over.", "3973 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Can I ask one more question about your LTE? ", "3974 If you\u2019re going to be offering a voice product over that LTE, it\u2019s a fixed product with arrangements that cannot form part of a mobile LTE network?", "3975 MR. LENEHAN: We get that question a lot.", "3976 So technically speaking, we could but it\u2019s a business choice we\u2019ve made that we think we have a mission that we still need to focus on, which is to provide internet service to rural homes and businesses. And I do believe that to focus on mobile at the present time would defocus us from that mission.", "3977 So technically, we are capable of doing so, subject to spectrum availability to us but by and large we stay -- we want to stay very focused on what we\u2019re doing.", "3978 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay.", "3979 You\u2019ve proposed that we set an aspirational target of 25 Megs -- 25 down. Remind me what you said might be the upload.", "3980 MR. LENEHAN: We proposed one upload, 1 Megabits upload.", "3981 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Twenty-five (25) and 1. What\u2019s the basis for that expectation of future demand, future needs?", "3982 MR. LENEHAN: On the upload or download? ", "3983 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Both.", "3984 MR. LENEHAN: So let me -- like I said in the opening comments, when we separate the distinction between basic, which is the purpose of this conversation, and then advanced is a bit different.", "3985 So when we look at basic services for Canadians, we don\u2019t foresee today anything that would require a 25 Megabits.", "3986 However, what we are suggesting is that let\u2019s not focus on where the buck is but where it\u2019s going, and internet is moving so quickly that we want to get ahead of this. And so let\u2019s set a 25 Megabit goal on what we believe to be services that are required in the future that may require video content for their delivery.", "3987 And we would not suggest we know all of what\u2019s going to happen or else we all would have seen Netflix coming when we sat here in 2010.", "3988 So we just suggest that when we do the evaluation on what people may require in the future, it will be more than 5 Megabits. And so when we do our analysis on what is possible to occur, then it is certainly higher and we think 25 is (a) a very reasonable expectation of what could be required; and (b) what we believe Canada is more than able to accomplish.", "3989 That does not preclude us from delivering much faster speeds and capability beyond the basic but in terms of what we see in the future on the 25.", "3990 When it comes to the 1, I\u2019ll quickly say we submitted 1 only because we haven\u2019t seen a really compelling need of our customer group beyond the 1 from a need perspective. But we\u2019re receptive; we\u2019ve seen other proposals of perhaps 3. We\u2019re very receptive to a 3, if we believe that that is a better upload goal than what we may see for data.", "3991 So we\u2019d be a little more flexible that if 1 isn\u2019t quite the right number for the target, then we would evaluate slightly higher. But based on what we see, we haven\u2019t seen a tremendous amount of need on the 1 Meg upload.", "3992 MR. DINESEN: If I may add just in support of what we foresee as supporting the requirement for a 25 Meg service, different from streaming media for entertainment purposes such as Netflix, we do see in the next three to five years an increased requirement for media-rich type applications, such as telepresence, remote learning, access to -- accessibility to government services, which could drive the consumption of more video-type services into a typical residential home. And that in itself could accommodate or could require a difference from 5 to 25 Megabits per month on a per-household basis making the distinction between wants and needs as regards this video.", "3993 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes. You know, there were comments made that the Commission shouldn\u2019t involve itself in how people use their internet and I think you would find general agreement that it isn\u2019t our intent to involve ourselves in how people they use their internet application. However, in defining what you basically require, you know, to be able to access, that becomes the need. What you do with it once your basic needs are met is not necessarily our requirement.", "3994 Having said that, of course there\u2019s also the problem of these data caps that exist that restrict people\u2019s use, you know, between wants and needs.", "3995 Let me go back to the 25 and 1. The 5 and 1 can be sort of -- you can sort of map what are the applications of essential need today and can those be achieved within 5 megs? And I think there\u2019s general consensus yes, they can.", "3996 I understand it\u2019s really difficult to know what is a relatively short window. I think you\u2019re talking about a four or five-year window here until 25 would become an aspirational target for four or five years. So kind of almost a build cycle. For the next build cycle we\u2019d be talking 25. And yet, I\u2019ve seen no evidence, no math, if you will, that helps get us to that 25. You know, if you have any I\u2019d be interested in seeing it.", "3997 I hear what you say; you know, there may be more educational videos and so on. And I know we don\u2019t know what the next application is, but it sure would be nice to have something a little more concrete to base an aspirational target on.", "3998 That target did, as you acknowledged, become the ceiling for some of the builds that occurred with government funding, you know, over the last five years. And so if it becomes the ceiling for funding going forward, I think we should try and put as much discipline around establishing that ceiling as we can.", "3999 So if there\u2019s anything more than, \u201cWell, it\u2019s 5 and we think it could grow a little bit, we think it could grow five-fold in the next four or five years,\u201d we\u2019d be interested in seeing more.", "4000 MR. LENEHAN: It\u2019s a fair question. I sure wish in 2010 we knew exactly what was going to happen over the course of five years. Because frankly from our perspective, if you look at just the patterns of consumption during those periods of time, and you folks have done a pretty good job of capturing that in your reports -- we haven\u2019t seen \u201915 yet but we have a pretty good idea what it looks like from our perspective. It\u2019s a very different consumption pattern of consumers. The question is how do you evaluate that consumption?", "4001 And what was see is two general patterns occurring. One is clearly we now can clearly state that video is inherent in what people want to do. And what that is by application will evolve over time.", "4002 But that\u2019s not the full, full lens of simply taking what you do and doing more of it such as video. There\u2019s also this growing continued connection to an internet connection that is beyond a PC. It is more than just simply one laptop. It is now more than just everyone in the home that has one laptop or one PC are connecting. It\u2019s now every time we walk into the room some device is trying to talk to the network, which is really changing the dynamic of not only how much does one person need to view. It\u2019s also what is the connection in that home attempting to support for ongoing traffic? ", "4003 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re kind of mapping out. It\u2019s kind of exploded in exponential in terms of not just depth of what people want to do, but not breadth of the number of devices attempting to do it. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to, the best we can, anticipate what\u2019s going to occur over the next five years both on consumption of applications and just doing more of it, such as standard definition goes to ultra definition. And that will get lots of attention.", "4004 In addition to that, though, is how much will just simply the expansion of devices connecting to the internet affect what your service level is? And that\u2019s a question for us that we\u2019ve been grappling with as well and trying really hard to work with leading world experts to try to figure out what that\u2019s going to look like.", "4005 So did I miss anything? We\u2019re happy to engage the best we can on how to anticipate what will be for five years. We\u2019d really encourage us all to A, set a -- you used the ceiling; if you wouldn\u2019t mind I would request that be more of a floor that we aim for -- and then say as an industry we should aspire as an industry to exceed that floor with much higher ceilings that deliver not only what is required of them but always what they want. Because effectively, if you go through all the feedback we get, that\u2019s effectively what it is. ", "4006 People just want to do more of what they want to do, including watching Netflix and so on, and you can take all the different video-streaming services, which is a very unique change in the way people consume versus when we sat here in 2010. So as an example, there\u2019s one; love to see what that would look like by application but also the expansion of devices.", "4007 Did I miss anything?", "4008 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And you know, I\u2019m not suggesting that we are trying to set a ceiling; for sure a floor is better than a ceiling. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s been communicated to us that it became the ceiling when there was funding or other requirements involved.", "4009 MR. LENEHAN: If I could submit, I don\u2019t think from our point of view that\u2019s entirely true, with one exception which is does take time to build the infrastructure. So that\u2019s the key piece for us on today versus the near future. I mean, our committed technology roadmap needs to be pretty crisp in the next 12 to 24 months because it just takes lead time to build towers for fixed wires and procure spectrum launch satellites. ", "4010 So it really is for us trying to get as much clear policy from you folks and other government agencies of what he landscape will look like in due course so that we can continue to make infrastructure investments ahead of what people will want.", "4011 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. That\u2019s very fair.", "4012 And the vision you want from us is not the floor? And you have the ability through your customer interactions and visions and so on to establish your own ceilings? You want something different from us than what we believe is the necessary element?", "4013 MS. PRUDHAM: We\u2019re encouraging the Commission to consider a need-based response or an aspirational target of 25. So that\u2019s based on the needs. But what we\u2019re saying is exactly the issue you\u2019ve raised, that people might think that that should be the ceiling. We think the Commission should say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s the floor. You should be aiming for the moon and keep going.\u201d And that\u2019s why ---", "4014 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, then if it helped to aim for the moon -- there you go; Commission direction, aim for the moon.", "4015 So you\u2019ve been really quite -- courteous might not be the correct word, but you have understated perhaps your concern with the CRTC\u2019s involvement in this file as we\u2019re talking today versus what appears, I think, in your submission and the tone of your concern with CRTC involvement in some of this or what it might do to private investment opportunities or otherwise. I think that you\u2019ve made quite clear in your submission your concern that our involvement, the establishment of subsidies or otherwise, is a concern to you from a private-investment perspective, from your own private-enterprise perspective.", "4016 So I\u2019m going to put the issue of subsidy, whether or not there should be a subsidy, aside for just a minute, and ask you, we can set an aspirational target, a floor, the aspirational floor to meet the needs of Canadians going forward. Do you see any other important contributions that the Commission could make to this file, going forward?", "4017 MS. PRUDHAM: This is certainly a very challenging time for the Commission. I absolutely loathe to use the word because it sounds so 1990s, but convergence happened, when we weren\u2019t looking maybe, but it did in fact happen that you have all the different media coming together essentially and a lot of it is now delivered through the internet. That represents a tremendous challenge for the Commission in terms of reimagining the policies and procedures around that. ", "4018 So we think there is a very large scope of a role for the Commission in terms of thinking about the framework because no one else is, frankly, thinking about all of that.", "4019 And we recognize some of it may be beyond the scope of the Commission. As the Chair referenced, you don\u2019t draft the legislation. But still, within the existing legislation there\u2019s lots of opportunities to help guide the industry in terms of the policies, going forward.", "4020 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And fair enough. And I guess I would ask you if you have some specifics? You know, it\u2019s fair to say, \u201cGuide the industry\u201d and we\u2019ll ask a question and the industry will say, \u201cGet out of here; stop that.\u201d ", "4021 What is it that would guide? What is it that would move forward? What would facilitate work of the industry to meet the needs of Canadians? Is there a role we can play that would facilitate something?", "4022 MS. PRUDHAM: Although I may regret saying this, traffic management may be an example and the hearing the Commission undertook on traffic management. ", "4023 It was an extensive and fair hearing; it allowed all sides to present their view. And it created an existing framework that we all work within and disclosure obligations for transparency with consumers. I think that\u2019s a very reasonable role for the Commission to be playing. And admittedly we may not always like the outcome from that, but it\u2019s working.", "4024 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. And I\u2019m going to make my own comment on traffic management. ", "4025 I was part of that as well and we had large discussions about the use of economic ITMPs, which have now become full-time data caps and do not align at all with traffic management. So that\u2019s an unfortunate outcome, I think, when the industry suggested they would be used to help manage congestion and they have been put in place as simply part of a rate plan, not managing peak period or other congestion within the network. So that\u2019s my own commentary.", "4026 Let me go on to another role perhaps we might play. Is there issues related to monitoring or information that would be valuable to you? Would you see that?", "4027 MS. PRUDHAM: With respect to industry statistics and things of that nature?", "4028 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "4029 MS. PRUDHAM: Absolutely. I know everyone at this table certainly looks forward to your annual report and the information contained in there. If you go back several years and start to look at how much you\u2019ve expanded the internet section, that would be extremely helpful.", "4030 And I know we occasionally point out that you do not always include our satellites in some of those statistics. We would welcome the opportunity to work with the Commission to figure out how they can be meaningfully included so that we get a good picture of what\u2019s going on out there. So absolutely.", "4031 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: One more question and I will pass you to my colleagues.", "4032 TekSavvy when they were here were stating that there could also be a role for the Commission in helping to facilitate or identify interexchange private line transport facilities that exist, that there\u2019s not a lot of discoverability, if you will. It\u2019s hard to sometimes discover what sort of transport facilities are there.", "4033 I assume given that you folks are using LTE networks, wireless networks you might have some interest in transport facilities; do you?", "4034 MR. LENEHAN: Well, let me defer to Tim. As a facilities-based provider I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve seen much of that as being an issue. But perhaps Tim can comment a little further on that.", "4035 DINESEN: No.", "4036 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Middle mile transport is not an issue for you at all?", "4037 MR. DINESEN: Well, transport is certainly a consideration for us when we\u2019re building facilities. I can\u2019t comment on what\u2019s motivating TekSavvy\u2019s perspective. But visibility-wise we generally have a good handle on what facilities are available where we have interest in building network.", "4038 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Well, good to know. It\u2019s always good to get a second opinion on this.", "4039 MR. DINESEN: Right.", "4040 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. Those were my questions.", "4041 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "4042 Well, first of all your comment about the converged world we\u2019re facing. I wish people like yourselves would take a little bit more time to explain that to members of the Heritage Committee instead of being lobbied by people who are nostalgic for the 1980s.", "4043 Now, I was listening to your presentation and you make considerable investments. But I take it that what you said is that was mostly to serve your existing customer-base rather than improve the quality of (inaudible) rather than necessarily be targeting growth strategies. Did I understand that correctly?", "4044 MR. LENEHAN: Sorry, maybe I mixed and matched.", "4045 So to this point, if the comment was about the last five years, we have continued to invest significantly in our network for current customers. But I would say the waiting has been a bit more towards the favour of a bit more expansion towards new and other areas.", "4046 My comment was around for the new satellites that are coming up, as an example, we are very mindful that the investment will start, just like our LTE network last year, as much starting with current customers and providing what they need in the near future, as well as capacity for future expansion. So we\u2019re taking a little more balanced and perhaps a little more aggressive view on current customer at this moment than perhaps the last five years.", "4047 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "4048 So let me bring you back to Nunavut. I understand that there\u2019s a technical issue. But I want to explore sort of the marketing, customer-service aspects to a potential service up in the north in satellite-dependent communities. Do you think you have the marketing and delivery capacity to meet the needs of those communities many of which are dependent on air transport for any kinds of service and if they have any sea transport it\u2019s maybe once a year?", "4049 MR. LENEHAN: Great question. I\u2019d say, just to make sure I ---", "4050 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m looking forward to seeing your assessment of my other questions.", "4051 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah, not as good, no.", "4052 No, it was a really good question because we get it all the time and I\u2019m glad you asked it. Maybe that was a better way of framing it, to say, \u201cThank you for asking it.\u201d Because we get this and I want to make sure I say this right.", "4053 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a technical issue. I do believe it\u2019s an investment issue with respect to technology that\u2019s available. And that\u2019s a slight difference. So today it may be perceived as a technical issue because we have not invested sufficient capital towards that technology solution in certain places. I won\u2019t speak specifically to Nunavut but certain places.", "4054 And it does take time. So when we say, \u201cYes\u201d to that investment, it takes time for us to construct and deploy that investment.", "4055 So that would be my comment on infrastructure; just continually fostering the development of that takes some time.", "4056 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, but my question focuses more on the soft aspects to business.", "4057 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah. So the reason I say this is the best I can tell you is experience-wise myself I come from the world of satellite television where we had a similar problem. I was one of the original folks a part of Star Choice Television Network and Tim happened to be with Bell TV. We both had this same challenge in more remote parts of the country. Not just the north, but there are other parts where it is very challenging. So it does require a different operational structure to provide them proper service.", "4058 We do think we have the capability to do that. I do think that generally we support -- as we commented we do have customers across all of Canada and different provinces and territories.", "4059 So we are capable of doing it. Whether we are doing it extensively enough, perhaps not; you\u2019d have to give me the exact example on how we\u2019re not and we should look into that because we don\u2019t always get it right. But I do think we have more than the capability to do that with proper investment and time.", "4060 THE CHAIRPERSON: I really did want to focus on Nunavut more than other places because of the reality that truck rolls are just not an option, right? It\u2019s just too far, the distance as such. ", "4061 So we\u2019ve heard evidence so far that one of the challenges is that if somebody in one of those remote communities -- and remote meaning you can\u2019t even get there other than by air -- means that if there\u2019s no local agent and there\u2019s no technician available, that\u2019s extremely costly. So that\u2019s the capability I\u2019m asking about. ", "4062 MR. LENEHAN: It -- and the reason why I\u2019m saying it is -- just as -- and as an example of -- it is different to do it.", "4063 And the only reason I\u2019m saying not just Nunavut, there are other -- British Columbia we have similar challenges because they tend to be harder to reach places.", "4064 THE CHAIRPERSON: M\u2019hm.", "4065 MR. LENEHAN: It is a different operating structure that we have to deploy, which tends to do a lot more scheduling, long lead times on installation.", "4066 And when it comes to support once we do have them provisioned, your support can be by professional installers, but that may not be always available in a timeframe required, which requires proper technical support to enable that customer.", "4067 Because our product, while we do not encourage and do anything but professional installs as a principle, where there is exception is we will provide troubleshooting support for a lot of these folks remotely and they are very creative folks that are very good.", "4068 And only reason I\u2019m pointing to our past experience is that effectively is how we ended up solving the video divide, if it were, from years ago, which was just a different operating model.", "4069 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Am I correct in assuming that delivering quality service in those areas costs more? ", "4070 MS. PRUDHAM: Sorry, if I may just --", "4071 THE CHAIRPERSON: Sure.", "4072 MS. PRUDHAM: -- also bring to your attention, we did answer interrogatories with respect to how we install and provide service in the north, so the information is on the record that was confidential, but we do a range for fly-ins. ", "4073 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "4074 MS. PRUDHAM: We do recognize that some of these communities are difficult to reach.", "4075 THE CHAIRPERSON: And the costs of that --", "4076 MS. PRUDHAM: We\u2019re ---", "4077 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- do you spread it across -- I don\u2019t want to get the exact number. I just want your accounting practices. ", "4078 Do you spread around those additional costs across all customers or do you target specifically those that are in those areas, because I can (inaudible).", "4079 MS. PRUDHAM: As we indicated in the response, yes. ", "4080 What we try to do in those communities is we try to aggregate more than one installation at that time to make it more cost-efficient and usually we\u2019re quite successful in bundling up a group of them, so it\u2019s spread across a number of them.", "4081 THE CHAIRPERSON: So a group of customers in that locality?", "4082 MS. PRUDHAM: Yes.", "4083 THE CHAIRPERSON: Not across your general subscriber base?", "4084 MS. PRUDHAM: Exactly, so in that specific community. ", "4085 THE CHAIRPERSON: I was looking at their most recent CCTS report, which covers August 1st to 31 January. ", "4086 MS. PRUDHAM: M\u2019hm.", "4087 THE CHAIRPERSON: So that\u2019s six months. From what I can see from the annex there you have 91 complaints, presumably of all sorts.", "4088 By comparison Rogers has 300 -- 437 for that same period. You have 300,000 subscribers. Rogers has, on the wireless side maybe 9.5 million and on the internet side about 2 million. ", "4089 So tell me about your strategy to deal with 91 complaints, which you can see is a bit out of whack in number of subscribers you might have against other service providers.", "4090 MS. PRUDHAM: It is in fact, as you notice, a bit of a spike from the prior year. Certainly that has occurred and we mentioned at length we certainly push the envelope to try and deploy new technologies. ", "4091 What happened last year -- and we have been public about trying to solve this problem for our customers, is when we started rolling out the LTE we did experience some issues. ", "4092 And it was difficult to initially assess what that was and that did precipitate the spike in complaints that we received. ", "4093 We are delighted to report we managed to break the back of the issue and you should hopefully see that number decline this year, it is our sincere hope, as a result. So that is why perhaps we were a little out of whack last year.", "4094 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. I\u2019m more concerned that it would be your hope to reduce that number. ", "4095 MS. PRUDHAM: It absolutely is, yes. ", "4096 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar started talking about this and I think I need a little bit more on the record, because you said at page 3 of your oral presentation, you\u2019re talking about: ", "4097 \u201cConversely playing real time video games or replacing your T.V. service with video streamings are wants not needs. Canadians want these services as an industry we are investing to meet this market demand but they are not a necessity.\u201d (As read)", "4098 What would you say to those that have appeared and others that will appear that say that the CRTC should not be making normative standards about what internet services people are using through their broadband connections?", "4099 MR. LENEHAN: As a -- I can\u2019t comment to how you would respond to that. ", "4100 What I would say as the present CEO of Xplornet, is I take all that feedback as market asking us to do more as a business and I think that we will continue to invest to meet that need as we go forward. ", "4101 However, what we\u2019re suggesting, and this is the difficulty of the hearing, is as a business we would prefer to talk about meeting all customer wants in rural Canada. That\u2019s our focus.", "4102 But you have a specific question around what is -- what is a basic service of Canadians and unfortunately it requires us to talk about basics as opposed to what people want, which is more of what I do every day. That\u2019s what I focus on.", "4103 So when it comes to delineation as to what is a basic service for Canadians, we\u2019ve done the best we can to put forward our view of what we think is a necessity of Canadians and it\u2019s our view that we want to serve. ", "4104 We want to continue to build infrastructure to allow them to replace their television set with internet traffic, which is effectively in some ways consuming a similar product, just a different way. ", "4105 That is a good thing as a business, because that -- we\u2019re not in the satellite television business. We\u2019re in the internet business. So that shifting interest towards our products and services is an encouraging thing from our point of view.", "4106 But if it\u2019s the question around what is defined as a necessity as Canadians, it would be our position that we don\u2019t think replacing the infrastructure of a movie service on one platform to another is defined as a basic service.", "4107 THE CHAIRPERSON: Building on that -- and that\u2019s why you\u2019re talking -- you actually prefer an aspirational goal rather than a regulatory goal? I get that. ", "4108 MR. LENEHAN: Yes.", "4109 THE CHAIRPERSON: So assuming an aspirational goal, which is what you\u2019re advocating, of 25/1 and I heard that you\u2019re probably not wedded strictly to the 1, because there may be some issues around that and ---", "4110 If we were to accept that aspect, what would you think we should include as an aspirational goal with respect to latency?", "4111 MR. LENEHAN: I would -- and this is where I\u2019ll probably dovetail into a question that was asked earlier around what the role this Commission can pursue. ", "4112 I think I would ask the question \u2018what issue are we trying to solve\u2019 and that\u2019s such a simple question that engineers start with and then it gets very complex. ", "4113 I think it comes down to that\u2019s a very technical question which I\u2019ll -- if you would like Tim can talk about it being from a technical perspective, but I would say that for the issue of basic service and whether latency is inherently impeding peoples\u2019 ability to deliver necessary services to them, I would advocate that\u2019s not the case. So a phone call can be made. Perhaps there\u2019s a little more latency. ", "4114 I would also argue that that would have been the same argument of a mobile network not too long ago, because it has more latency of that same phone call then landline, but people are choosing to pursue a mobile network over a landline for other reasons. ", "4115 So hence I would submit that if it\u2019s around what they want to do, we tend to find that latency, while remaining an issue for people want to do and we need to continue to attack that problem very aggressively, it is not impeding peoples\u2019 ability for doing what they need to do.", "4116 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. I\u2019m not sure you were in the room earlier today. Like technology hearings sometimes accelerate faster than we expect.", "4117 MR. LENEHAN: True.", "4118 THE CHAIRPERSON: But we had one intervenor talking about his household\u2019s inability, due to latency, to have stable VPN. To conduct -- and somebody was working out of their home, as an employee. ", "4119 So I appreciate sometimes we don\u2019t always appreciate as individuals, because we\u2019re not engineers, things about speed and latency, but that\u2019s -- the customer experience in that case suggests that they would have wanted to experience a more stable VPN and they cannot because there is no normative standard with respect to latency. ", "4120 MS. PRUDHAM: Well I\u2019ll let Tim answer the highly technical. For the non-technical that depends on the VPN. VPN and latency did not work very well originally. But most VPN today that you'll see, for example, in online banking or others are application based and do not suffer from the issues that were impacted by latency.", "4121 So it's a different architecture that's used today for VPN, for the more modern versions, which not impede it. ", "4122 So Tim can certainly provide a better technical explanation.", "4123 MR. DINESEN: Yeah, thank you. My commercial colleagues have been well trained. I usually start the conversation like this: what problem are we trying to solve?", "4124 And so it goes to what applications, what use cases, what's a reasonable expectation of a service definition for what we describe as a basic service? And whether VPN is included, there are different solutions for that, different flavours of VPN behave differently under different circumstances. ", "4125 And going straight to what a basic definition of latency, if I can draw an analogy to the broadcast business, it's like asking what kind of bit rate should we mandate for a high-definition service? Well, that changes and it depends on the service. ", "4126 So it would be, I think, more helpful for us to have the conversation about what the requirements are around the definition of a basic service, before we start getting directly into what the technical solutions are to support that service. Latency will be a consideration in some applications, in some cases, for which satellite, for example, might not be the best fit technology. ", "4127 But that's not to say that satellite in different forms with different application-type configurations can't support a broad array of what we consider to be the requirements of a basic service. ", "4128 THE CHAIRPERSON: So I get back to my original question as to whether we should be. I understand it will depend on a case-by-case basis?", "4129 MR. DINESON: Yeah, and --- ", "4130 THE CHAIRPERSON: But whether the Commission -- I've asked this of others -- where they're beyond defining in terms of speeds, because everybody's concentrating on speed, for some reason and nobody's thinking about price and other parameters like jitter and latency. ", "4131 So I'm asking you, because you proposed a aspirational target, should an aspirational target include such things as latency? ", "4132 MR. DINESEN: I don't think it would be helpful, personally. ", "4133 THE CHAIPERSON: Why not? ", "4134 MR. DINESEN: Because it wouldn't -- you can't directly make the connection between the technical specification and how that's going to translate into a product capability in all cases. ", "4135 If you mandate latency, then we could be chasing a solution that is not fit for the problem we're trying to solve. If you say that latency must be this, it starts to drive the solution towards a very specific technical solution as opposed to generally a solution to a problem that's trying to be framed. ", "4136 THE CHAIRPERSON: So what would be your answer to that individual who's frustrated -- I might actually, dare I suggest, angry -- about their situation, because they cannot -- they had expectations to be able to do certain things through a VPN setup? Maybe they've got the wrong one, maybe they don't understand the technology, but they're still frustrated. ", "4137 MR. DINESEN: Right. ", "4138 THE CHAIRPERSON: So --- ", "4139 MR. DINESEN: And I think the answer, in general terms, would be, what are you trying to accomplish? ", "4140 I'm trying to accomplish a VPN session between my home and wherever else. What is the technology that is supporting that VPN solution, and are there alternatives? ", "4141 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, so you're suggesting you, as service providers, would be able to do that? Are you? ", "4142 MR. DINESEN: Well, we're not --- ", "4143 THE CHAIRPERSON: If that person happened to be your customer? ", "4144 Mr. LENEHAN: Yes, we would pursue that exact line of questioning, and I -- we\u2019d simply say, in -- we deal with this question a fair amount from the marketplace and I think we've done a reasonable job of finding solutions to those issues. ", "4145 But I would be -- I would hesitate to say we could solve this problem, because we would need to truly understand exactly what his (inaudible). ", "4146 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m using that as an example. I don\u2019t think we'll use the hearing to solve that particular individual's problems, but is in an indicia of broader frustration and you know, there's some people that are more sophisticated than others. And standards are a way to get to remove individual frustration, because they set a -- whether it's a floor or ceiling -- they set a norm against which people must act. ", "4147 MR. LENEHAN: Yeah, it's -- the question -- we continue to answer this way, because I'll leave it to Tim to talk about the technical and the customer, if we had the example, because we do handle this question from the marketplace -- is that -- and I know you asked this about satellite. And I'll just remind the Commission that much if not more than our business is wireless-driven and we have successfully continued to drive down the latency of that network overall, so I think that one's hopefully sufficient for people's questions. ", "4148 On the satellite side, well, we are reducing it down to small amounts of questions outstanding in the near future on what people want to do, so I think, simply, you continue to build infrastructure for more capacity and packaging it in a way -- and I'm glad you pointed out that speed data and price are all somewhat related, so we need to keep packaging those up. ", "4149 But reliability has become not an attribute, but a requirement, so we are very fixated on delivering the reliable network, and that includes what people want to do. ", "4150 If we've got this down to customer-particular issues on VPN sessions, then we will focus on those solutions, so we have found lots of solutions for customers of ours that have faced that same question.", "4151 So I'm reasonably comfortable we can handle most of those circumstances. ", "4152 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And if I would ask you, in terms of aspirational targets beyond latency, are there others that we should be thinking about? ", "4153 So reliability is -- I don't know what that -- how big that is. What does it look like, how tall, wide? ", "4154 MR. LENEHAN: Well, I -- the great point on reliability, which is we know about it when it's not reliable because somebody immediately calls and then we need to figure out quickly what the issue is and resolve that. And I think we've been spending --- ", "4155 THE CHAIRPERSON: We don\u2019t have to worry about that, because it's always the CRTC's fault in the end, right?", "4156 MR. LENEHAN: Well, I don't know if that's always the case, but in all seriousness, in some cases it's our fault. We didn\u2019t do something right and I wouldn\u2019t suggest we always get it right, but I am very confident representing all of Xplornet to say, \"We may not get it right the first time, but we're not done. We will continue to focus on solving that problem for the customer.\" ", "4157 So no, I would like to blame it on the CRTC, but in some cases, it is our fault and we try to remedy that as quickly as possible. ", "4158 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. As the hearing progresses, you might want to add to this particular issue because I think it is one that we will be struggling with. ", "4159 And I'm not forcing you take a position one way or another, but I would like to have your views on it in the final argument. ", "4160 I believe legal has a question for you. Thank you. ", "4161 MS. HANLEY: We wanted to clarify an undertaking that you had discussed with Commissioner Molnar regarding the government funding that's been received buy Xplornet. ", "4162 You had indicated that you had already provided some information on the record of the proceeding, but there's some specific information that we would like to see. ", "4163 In respect to any government funding you have received to cover the costs of broadband internet infrastructure, please provide the following information: the amount of funding received from each funding program for the purpose of offsetting satellite transport costs. Please provide totals by program and by year. ", "4164 As well, during the years in which you received funding from these programs, what were the annual costs and capacity for the satellite transport services used to provide broadband internet services in your serving territories? Again, please provide the annual cost and capacity by program and per year. Can you undertake to provide that by May 5th? ", "4165 MS. PRUDHAM: With one important clarification. Could you clarify what you mean by \"satellite transport\"? ", "4166 MS. de SOMMA: (Inaudible) the satellite transponder cost that you incur for the lease of satellite transponder capacity? ", "4167 MS. PRUDHAM: Sorry, and forgive for me for asking the question, but in the satellite enquiry there was a considerable cost. We kept getting asked about transport. We're a direct-to-home, so just to be clear, this is -- you're asking about the direct-to-home costs associated; is that correct?", "4168 THE CHAIRPERSON: I think the issue here is that we're asking a standard question and in your case, the answer may be \"not applicable\". ", "4169 MS. PRUDHAM: Well, that's what I was worried and I didn\u2019t want to give a \"not applicable\" response. ", "4170 THE CHAIRPERSON: I think we've asked this similar to another intervenor and it may not be (inaudible) your case. ", "4171 MS. PRUDHAM: Okay, so to clarify, we have no satellite transport, so there -- I guess there's no undertaking because there's nothing to report. ", "4172 MS. HANLEY: Thank you. ", "4173 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah. Perhaps we can clarify offline as well if there's a misunderstanding there. That's best. ", "4174 I've forgotten one question that I wanted to ask, because you're one of the few parties so far that have raised this. You\u2019ve talked about -- to address affordability and it's on page (inaudible). You prefer an income-based subsidy, but you said it was best administered by the Government of Canada, who has the data and identified eligible Canadians.", "4175 I was wondering if you had actually more thoughts about that; first of all, why the Government of Canada is opposed to provincial or territorial governments and, second, are you thinking that it should be part of an input into social assistance programs? Are you thinking of a refundable tax credit, if you could put meat around that bone?", "4176 MS. PRUDHAM: Thank you. That's a great question. You're right. We tried to compress an awful lot into a single sentence there.", "4177 We are indeed thinking that the primary issue is that if you create just, you know, a cheap package what you have is a lot of people -- it's a rather blunt instrument to try and get at the affordability issue. You might have a lot of people taking advantage of it who are not necessarily in need, when what's important is we get to the folks who actually need assistance.", "4178 One of the other statistics in the materials we had earlier provided was the percentage of Canadians without access to a computer. So if you are going to say, okay, we are going to subsidize you for internet access you have to make sure they have got the other piece that goes with it. Otherwise, having internet access without a computer or an appropriate device is useless.", "4179 We also alluded to the fact that you need the skills.", "4180 So from our perspective it is a package. You have to look at it as a holistic package.", "4181 And we refer to the Government of Canada but, you are quite right, we do believe this is provincial and in working with some of the municipalities, we believe actually the municipalities can be quite successful in some of these aspects.", "4182 So what we were focusing on was the folks who had the right data to assess who was in need and who can put together the collective package that needs to go together to make sure they are connected.", "4183 THE CHAIRPERSON: So both connectivity and devices?", "4184 MS. PRUDHAM: Yes, and education.", "4185 THE CHAIRPERSON: And, oh, the digital skillset.", "4186 MS. PRUDHAM: The skills, exactly.", "4187 THE CHAIRPERSON: Associated with it, okay; understood. Thank you very much.", "4188 I think those are our questions. We are quite late on our mid-morning break.

It's no longer optional. It's essential for businesses and employees, students and educators, agriculture and tourism and, certainly key families.", "4206 Rural internet has fallen drastically behind the urban standards which negatively impacts our rural residents. Our rural area is essentially landlocked. We are neither the traditional rural area nor are we truly urban.", "4207 We are denied our service because of spectrum constraints and our geography.", "4208 Milton is the Toronto licence area and the licence spectrum is not available as it is currently owned and controlled by Inukshuk Wireless Partnership, a partnership between Rogers and Bell.", "4209 The only available spectrum is the limited capacity \u201clightly licensed\u201d 3.65 MHz frequency, which is also shared with 20 other users. I have Appendix A attached to my presentation which I trust you have a copy of.", "4210 The lightly licensed\u201d spectrum is saturated by the number of users, and therefore extremely restricted at reduced speeds of 4 megabytes to 5 megabytes and not available to any new subscribers due to saturation levels.

We are also the aggregate centre for Ontario.", "4213 But we are not alone as a rural area. Rural areas attached to large urban centers face this problem.", "4214 Residents are within minutes of major city connections but cannot access these options. This forces people to locate their businesses and homes within the urban corridors, while adding to the traffic problems. It's ironic that our transportation seems to centre on roads when, truly, we should be thinking of transportation over the airwaves as well.", "4215 Last year I conducted a survey and in just 10 days I had 363 responses. Only 9 percent were satisfied with their service.", "4216 There have been improvements but local providers are handcuffed by this spectrum issue.", "4217 When I asked in the survey, residents replied that 95 percent felt that internet speed was either critical or very important. Only 5 percent felt it was just important and none thought it was optional.", "4218 There is a -- Appendix C includes more definitions and more of this information but I am highlighting what I feel are the most important portions of the survey.", "4219 Multiple members of each household depend on the internet either regularly or frequently; 66 percent for business, using it for customers and services; 73 percent for working from home; research and telecommuting, for example; 77 percent are affected in the education sector; students, teachers, assignments and research; 98 percent use it for personal business; 73 for social connections and just 64 percent use it for entertainment.", "4220 When asked, residents shared their views and their stories. They did, and I have literally 40 pages of stories, many of them heartbreaking as to regarding their service. And I'd be happy to share those with you if you wish.", "4221 I basically have three recommendations. Two are outlined in the proposal and I will highlight the third.", "4222 The first recommendation is that the CRTC recognize that high-speed internet is essential and a basic telecommunication service.", "4223 Recommendation number two would be to request government assistance in freeing up the available spectrum to allow alternate carriers the option to provide rural residents with options.", "4224 The third and very much -- which isn't included in this but is related to that is that if these spectrums cannot be opened up that you recognize the unique challenges of rural areas attached to urban centres and carve these out of the urban bundles when they are offered, permitting smaller, even local utilities to compete for the spectrum capacity.", "4225 In closing, I'd like to share a photo. Believe it or not, in 2008 we first received internet -- high-speed internet working with the Ontario Ministry of -- the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, and we distributed high speed to rural Milton for the first time. To emphasize how important this was, we delivered our proposal to the Ontario Ministry by a wagon train because that\u2019s how far out of date we felt we were.", "4226 We\u2019re a little bit better these days but we are regressing back to those days where perhaps at the Model T stage. And we really ask that you help us solve this problem because it has an impact on real life. And we\u2019re a very progressive community, but we are certainly hampered by the fact that we have low speeds, unreliable speeds, and simply not enough capacity to meet today\u2019s needs.", "4227 I\u2019m happy to answer any questions and if you have any questions for Frank he\u2019s here with me as well to help. And thank you. I really appreciate the opportunity to present this case.", "4228 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you very much. And we did see your wagon train on the connection and appreciate that. And obviously the people in your ward are very well-represented by an eager advocate so thank you for that.", "4229 Commissioner MacDonald will have some questions for you.", "4230 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good morning and thank you for being part of this proceeding. And I applaud you being a champion for your constituents in bringing their voice into the hearing today.", "4231 I do have a few questions just with respect to your survey and just so I understand your particular ward a little bit better. And then I\u2019ll have some follow-ups as well.", "4232 Your ward is very large, about 64 percent of the landmass of your municipality. Are these service problems prevalent across your ward or is it just one or two specific areas that you represent that are suffering more than others?", "4233 MS. LUNAU: The ward is actually the former Township of Nassagaweya so it\u2019s a whole township. when regional government came in it was amalgamated.", "4234 These are issues that are faced by the rural community. The urban centre of Milton is very well-serviced. And indeed, many of our students and many of our business people must go to either one of the coffee shops in Milton or the Milton Public Library to simply get their work done.", "4235 Many of our students attend high school in the urban centre and they literally have to bring their homework assignments home on sticks because they can\u2019t access the information as their fellow urban students can. It presents a real problem in the education sector and in fact in all sectors.", "4236 If you want, I can read a short piece here from one of the comments. There\u2019s a university student at the Waterloo School of Pharmacy who cannot access reliable internet to do her research, submit assignments, and apply for co-op jobs from home. The parents have challenges; the mom runs a business out of the home, which requires frequent email contact. She resorts to the phone to complete her tasks. The dad works in Toronto. He uses the internet regularly and requires remote access for work computers. And he relies on his phone.", "4237 So this is, for example, how it affects one family. ", "4238 But it is strictly the rural area and Nassagaweya is part of the Greenbelt, which is a protected area, largely rock and water. So the population is spread out enough that the large providers are simply not interested in creating the -- providing the infrastructure. And yet, they have the spectrum capacity. Frank would correct me if I\u2019m misunderstanding that. But they own all of the spectrum capacity and are not sharing it with the smaller providers that are willing to invest in the infrastructure. So it\u2019s a very difficult situation.", "4239 If we were considered part of Wellington, we would be in a different spectrum entirely, which is the neighbouring county. I realize you\u2019re not (inaudible), but it\u2019s not unlike the suburbs of, say, Ottawa.", "4240 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, thank you for that.", "4241 When you conducted your survey you had 363 respondents. Were they all from the rural area or did people within the more densely populated area also partake in that survey?", "4242 MS. LUNAU: I believe that they were all within the rural area. The reason I cut it off after 10 days was because I wanted to ensure that it was in fact as local as possible. I could have left the survey open for another, you know, two weeks but at that point you may have other people dialling in, so to speak. It was not perhaps the most sophisticated survey, but I felt we were getting the local population.", "4243 We did have a community meeting with 300 people attending the community meeting. Representatives were there from Xplornet and Standard Broadband. Unfortunately, Rogers backed out at the last minute and Bell did not respond.", "4244 We had 300 people quizzing what could be done and it was basically that group of people and their neighbours and those who were unable to attend the community forum that I was looking for the internet responses, the survey responses from.", "4245 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: As you know, we have ---", "4246 MS. LUNAU: I feel it was truly local.", "4247 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, perfect.", "4248 As you noted, we had Xplornet presenting just before you and they were talking about a lot of their investments that they have made as of late and what\u2019s going to be coming over the next year to three years down the road. And I note that we received your first submission in June of last year so the survey would have been conducted before that. ", "4249 Has the situation at all improved for area residents over the last year with some of these new technologies coming to the forefront?", "4250 MS. LUNAU: I would say yes, it has. But unfortunately, because of the spectrum limitations, so much more is needed that I believe Xplornet has to literally turn away customers. The spectrum just isn\u2019t there.", "4251 And even where you do have the higher capacity -- I know I have upgraded my service through Xplornet because I wanted to understand it -- when everybody\u2019s in line it still isn\u2019t enough. It slows right down to a crawl.", "4252 But it is better. There\u2019s no question that the work that Xplornet and the investment that Xplornet and Standard have put into the community is helping. But it literally is a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed.", "4253 Frank, maybe you can ---", "4254 MR. ADILI: Yeah. I think, you know, Xplornet has shared some of their mappings and their upgrades of their different locations for the towers. And I think it\u2019s just the saturation point and that frequency range, that they can\u2019t exceed that frequency range because of the spectrum so they can\u2019t offer any more. ", "4255 And there\u2019s different competitors or players in that same frequency range using it. And so they\u2019re kind of limited right now to the 4 to 5 megs and they can\u2019t even bring new subscribers on because if they do it degrades everybody else on that same spectrum. So there\u2019s a real challenge. And even though they\u2019re upgrading their towers, they can\u2019t offer a higher capacity because it\u2019s severely restricted by that spectrum.", "4256 MS. LUNAU: If we\u2019re within another district I believe -- and another spectrum, the problem might go away.", "4257 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And have you had that discussion with any of the ---", "4258 MS. LUNAU: But I don\u2019t think that this is unique ---", "4259 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I was just going to ask you, have you had that discussion with any of the other government departments such as what would have been Industry Canada as they\u2019re responsible for issuing spectrum?", "4260 MS. LUNAU: Well, ironically we had a representative from what was then known as Industry Canada, their senior IT manager for southern Ontario and the western district, appear as part of the internet panel at the public meeting we had.", "4261 Lisa Raitt is one of my constituents and her neighbour uses her capacity because she runs out of her capacity by the middle of the month. And so she borrows her neighbour\u2019s internet.", "4262 But Lisa Raitt was very kind to ensure that someone from Industry Canada was at the panel. And I mean I certainly don\u2019t want to speak for Mr. Bastien (ph), but I believe that one of the solutions that we had chatted about would be that if in fact these rural areas were not competing with the urban centres for a spectrum; if they were seen as the anomaly and the little landlocked pieces of geography that they are.", "4263 So yes, we have chatted but again I know that sometimes government moves slowly.", "4264 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I\u2019m wondering about the -- I mean, you\u2019ve made it very ---", "4265 MS. LUNAU: I\u2019m hoping that ---", "4266 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Sorry, go ahead.", "4267 MS. LUNAU: No, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not quite used to the delay. You see, with my internet, I couldn\u2019t Skype. I mean, this is my first Skyping.", "4268 I am a -- dare I say it? I\u2019m new to this.", "4269 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: The survey ---", "4270 MS. LUNAU: I was going to say ---", "4271 THE CHAIRPERSON: I hate to disappoint but you haven\u2019t Skyped yet. This is just a videoconference facility but maybe one day.", "4272 MS. LUNAU: Ah! Okay.", "4273 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Your survey made very clear the impact this is having on residential customers in your ward. ", "4274 I\u2019m wondering about business customers and the challenges that they face, particularly small businesses that may be operating in the rural areas.", "4275 Have you had any conversations with your local Chamber of Commerce or do they have any data that they can share with respect to the impact it has on the economy of your region?", "4276 MS. LUNAU: The region of Halton is doing an outline, a draft for their strategy for the rural area. And one of the top threats for the rural area for business and farming and agriculture in the rural area, has been identified as poor internet service. It\u2019s one of the threats that is identified in the region\u2019s paper, their strategy.", "4277 I can give you a beautiful example. We have a new business that set up a couple of years ago called Terre Bleu Lavender Farms. They have 14,000 visits a year and well -- on Facebook and literally draw customers from across Ontario and even around the world.", "4278 And on their lavender acres they have -- they also produce honey, they produce products that are related to lavender that are locally sourced under their banner. They have acres of fields and trails.", "4279 They would love to be able to offer kind of a GPS interactive experience with their fields. This is lavender that produces at this time of year. They have a series of -- they produce their own honey.", "4280 But even those guided tours of the lavender farm are impossible because they don\u2019t have the internet capability for it.", "4281 We have a very strong horse racing industry and horse breeding industry in Nassagaweya. At one point, I think there were more horses than people where the\u2026", "4282 Campbellville is in Nassagaweya and it has Mohawk race track, which is Canada\u2019s perhaps premiere standard-bred operation. They have their own internet service obviously because they\u2019re also a source for the old Ontario Lottery -- OLG slots. So clearly, you know, they need to have reliable service.", "4283 But the people that they work with and that train and board the horses are absolutely dependent on internet as well.", "4284 The farming community uses it for crops, for GPS -- as they spread their fertilizers and such. They use it and need it. They use it to check commodity prices.", "4285 I would say that probably -- I would say without a doubt that 80 percent of the homes in my area have some form of business-at-home or business operation, whether it\u2019s their own business or whether it\u2019s telecommuting, whether it\u2019s working from home. We have a very strong business-from-home in the -- component and they need it.", "4286 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: With respect to your municipality, because I was on your Website earlier today and I see that you\u2019ve been a representative for 16 or 17 years at this point, so congratulations on that.", "4287 Has your community ever made any investments in delivering broadband services or applied for any funding of any kind to facilitate builds, build -- services into rural areas?", "4288 MS. LUNAU: The municipality supported the application that we put out to the Ontario government when they had a fund that first brought it in -- first brought internet to the rural area, in 2008.", "4289 But again, because we\u2019re a land of rock and stone, it\u2019s -- to trace the fibre is literally unrealistic. There is an interest from our local hydro distributor to perhaps use some of their technology to help but again they\u2019d have to have the spectrum capacity to do it, and they can\u2019t compete.", "4290 So as witnessed by Frank with me today, the town is certainly very supportive of what can be done, but there\u2019s a limit to what we can do as a municipality. ", "4291 It\u2019s private enterprise. It\u2019s seen as private enterprise, and we support private enterprise but whatever we can do to facilitate and help things happen and help private enterprise succeed in it, we support.", "4292 MR. ADILI: Well, I believe a few years back, didn\u2019t -- the town helped work with Xplornet to establish them too, in that environment, if I\u2019m not mistaken.", "4293 MS. LUNAU: Yeah. Wherever we\u2019re -- yes. And certainly we passed a resolution looking for solutions, and I believe that was included in my original submission.", "4294 But again we help where we can but as far as putting the tax dollars into laying lines and laying fibres and putting up towers, no.", "4295 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, thank you.", "4296 Sixty-eight (68) percent of the people that responded to your survey indicated that the costs were too high. And I was just wondering if you can explain that to me a little bit.", "4297 Is the view that the costs are too high relative to the service that they get or the costs too high relative to what may be available in downtown Toronto? Are they so high that they\u2019re not affordable for area residents?", "4298 Can you help explain that to me?", "4299 MS. LUNAU: In many cases -- in most cases, it depends upon the household usage.", "4300 In the 40 pages of comments, there are people who say that they pay more for their internet than they do for their hydro. And I think the biggest problem is that it may be -- the initial service is fine but by the time they use it, they\u2019ve gone so far over their caps that it becomes a $200 or a $300 bill.", "4301 I know that one -- one family I know allowed their children to use the internet on March break and came up with a $500 bill and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to happen again\u201d ---", "4302 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So would you say the ---", "4303 MS. LUNAU: --- they go over the cap.", "4304 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So would you say the issue of data usage at any caps is as important if -- maybe even more important than the actual speed that residents are able to receive?", "4305 MS. LUNAU: Living in a rural area, we\u2019re aware that generally everything costs a little bit more than it does in the city.", "4306 Most people are prepared to pay more than their city cousins for internet if they can count on it. It\u2019s just when it starts going over that $200 bill that people get a little bit upset.", "4307 So they\u2019re willing to pay more. They aren\u2019t trying to compare themselves with what is available at no charge or at a very little charge in town. But it becomes excessive when you start going into the $300, $400 range.", "4308 And this is -- and most people did not think that they are going to get Netflix. They aren't using it for that. They are using it for day to day survival, you know, business and educational survival.", "4309 MR. MacDONALD: Okay.", "4310 MR. ADILI: I think from just a review too, even the costs are maybe triple what they would be in the urban areas, you know, and that's for a 4 or 5 meg connection that has a great deal of restrictions on it; isn't continuous at 4 or 5 megs whereas, you know, in urban Milton you can get a 25 meg 5 connection for $45 a month or $50 a month. There's not even a chance for that. So they are paying hugely more amounts of money for much, much less service.", "4311 MR. MacDONALD: Okay. Just one final question and it's regarding directory listings and phonebooks. I am just wondering as a municipality how you use the phonebook. You advertise your services in it. Is that the primary way that area residents can get directory listing information or do you think some of those people are moving out those searches for telephone numbers online?", "4312 Because I actually note on your personal website you have emergency contact information and information about how to contact City Hall or the fire department or what have you. So I am just wondering if you see a continued relevance or importance of printed directory listings.", "4313 MS. LUNAU: Well, there are certainly people who are not connected to the internet, but I would say that probably most searches wherever it's feasible and they have the capacity, are probably done online. The town itself is moving more and more to online registrations, online information and, of course, our rural residents are left behind when it comes to that, especially if you are looking to get in a queue for lining up for swimming -- swim classes and you can't get through.", "4314 I have two internet accounts. One is with the -- one provider but two accounts. My town -- I use my town email very seldom because it's slow. By the time it bounces back and forth it can be a little bit slower than using my own personal email.", "4315 MR. MacDONALD: Okay, thank you very much. Those are my questions. And as someone who comes from a very rural area, a community of 420 people in rural New Brunswick, I certainly appreciate you bringing the voice of your rural residents to this proceeding.", "4316 I'll hand you back over to my colleagues. Thank you.", "4317 MS. LUNAU: Thank you.", "4318 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. So I have polled my colleagues here on the Commission and there are no further questions.", "4319 But I do want to thank you for having participated and brought a perspective to this hearing. It enriches our conversation. And I can only hope that sooner rather than later you will finally get to try to Skype for the first time in the coming months. So thank you very much.", "4320 MS. LUNAU: A real Skype?", "4321 THE CHAIRPERSON: A real Skype, yes.", "4322 MS. LUNAU: Thank you. I appreciate -- I appreciate your attention. Thank you.", "4323 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So we'll take a lunchbreak till 1:15.", "4324 Donc nous sommes en pause jusqu\u2019\u00e0 13h15. Merci.", "--- Upon recessing at 12:13 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 1:15 p.m.", "4325 THE SECRETARY: Please take your seats.", "4326 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: \u00c0 l'ordre, s'il vous pla\u00eet.", "4327 Order, please.", "4328 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "4329 THE SECRETARY: We will now hear the presentation of Telesat. Please introduce yourselves and your colleague, and you have 10 minutes.", "PRESENTATION", "4330 MR. SCOTT: Thank you. Thank you, Chairman, Members of the Commission.", "4331 Telesat is pleased to appear before you today at this important public hearing.", "4332 My name is Ian Scott. I am the Executive Director Regulatory and Government Affairs. With me today is Ms. Michele Beck, Vice-President North American Sales for Telesat.", "4333 Our purpose in appearing today is to address a few key points relating to the provision of broadband telecommunications services by fixed satellite, or FSS. More importantly perhaps, we are here to respond to any questions that you and your fellow Commissioners may have in relation to Telesat\u2019s role in providing these critical services to Northern and other remote communities.", "4334 As Members of the Panel will know, Telesat has been a provider of services to telecommunications service providers in Canada, including the Canadian North, for more than 40 years. Of particular interest in the present proceeding, Telesat offers high quality fixed satellite services to a variety of telecommunications service providers operating in Canada, as well as to military, government, and some enterprise customers. For purposes of the present proceeding, Telesat notes that the satellite industry is undergoing significant changes both structurally, in the form of increasing competition, and from a technological point of view, and that these changes are expected to continue in the foreseeable future. These changes will both increase available capacity and lower prices of satellite services in Canada, including the North. ", "4335 In particular the introduction of high throughput satellites often referred to as HTS, operating in the Ka-band and the Ku-band, is changing the cost structure of satellite services used for telecommunications purposes. By allowing the reuse of scarce radio spectrum, HTS technology increases capacity by an order of magnitude, while leading to lower prices.", "4336 For example, the current generation of HTS have more than 30 times the capacity of conventional C/Ku-band satellites. In the near term, this number will grow to 100 times the capacity, and future planned HTS will have approximately 400 times more throughput than conventional satellites. ", "4337 Telesat notes that the use of satellite services for the delivery of broadband to customers\u2019 homes is increasing, and currently takes two forms.", "4338 Traditionally delivery has been through a community aggregation model, that is, satellite capacity is transmitted to an earth station located in a community and terrestrial local distribution facilities are used to connect to individual households, businesses and government buildings. This model is used to provide service in communities like Iqaluit, and others as small as Old Crow with only 100 households. It is economically efficient, reliable and scalable and with the introduction of HTS, less costly than ever.", "4339 More recently, an additional distribution model has emerged to deliver telecommunications services, and especially residential broadband access, directly to residential customers\u2019 homes (DTH) and businesses, as exemplified by Xplornet from whom you heard this morning. This DTH model further increases the choices available to consumers in satellite-dependent territories or other areas of low population density.", "4340 For its part, over the last decade, Telesat has introduced significant new capacity, C-band, Ka-band and broadcast satellites to the North. It has invested over $1.6 billion in its last generation of satellites including F1R, F2, F3, N4 and N6. These satellites cover all of Canada, with specific emphasis on the North", "4341 More recently, on November 11th of last year -- of 2015, pardon me -- Telesat announced its plans to add additional capacity to the North. Specifically, Telesat announced its plans to procure a new satellite with two high throughput payloads. ", "4342 The new satellite, called Telstar 19 VANTAGE, will be co-located with Telesat\u2019s Telstar 14R at 63 degrees West, a prime orbital slot for coverage of the Americas. The satellite has high throughput Ka-band capacity over Northern Canada, as well as the Caribbean and the North Atlantic Ocean.", "4343 For Northern Canada, Telstar 19 VANTAGE will have multiple spot beams with coverage over most satellite-dependent communities and in excess of 20 Gbps of throughput capacity.", "4344 A further exciting development in satellite communications relates to the deployment of new non-geostationary constellations of small communications satellites operating in low earth orbit. Telesat\u2019s LEOVantage constellation will make available low latency broadband capacity to rural and remote areas. ", "4345 Telesat has been authorized by the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development to operate a global low earth orbit satellite constellation using the Ka-band frequencies, frequencies over which we believe we have very favourable ITU rights. Indeed, just recently Telesat announced that it is in the process of procuring two Ka-band satellites that it will be launching next year into low earth orbit. We are continuing to develop our plans for this constellation at this time and the two prototype satellites we\u2019re procuring will allow us, among other things, to begin testing, demonstration, and validation of certain key features of this new and advanced broadband satellite system.", "4346 All of the above will assist telecommunications service providers in the provision of residential broadband access throughout Canada, including northern Canada. ", "4347 One of the central questions posed by the Commission in the present proceeding concerns whether broadband should be considered a basic telecommunications service. Telesat believes that residential broadband access should be part of a basic service obligation. And if the Commission does make such a finding, Telesat believes that its current and planned services in the Ka-band and C-band will enable telecommunication service providers to provide such service in satellite-dependent communities, as well as across Canada more generally.", "4348 HTS in particular, used both in a community aggregation and direct-to-home model, will help to ensure that sufficient broadband capacity is available in the north. HTS will be capable of delivering much higher broadband speeds at prices much closer to what is available in the south. ", "4349 The introduction of HTS, along with other technological improvements, will go some way to alleviating any residual concerns that the high costs of FSS are a barrier to providing residential broadband access throughout northern Canada.", "4350 However, the fact remains that satellite costs are inherently higher than the costs of comparable terrestrial facilities in the south. This is part of a broader issue. The cost to power ground stations and local distribution networks are exponentially higher in the north, as are the costs of building materials and labour. Put simply, everything costs more in the north.", "4351 Satellite, however, remains the most efficient and effective vehicle to deliver broadband and other telecommunications services to remote areas. Moreover, the combination of new technologies, intense competition, and growth in the deployment of satellite services will help reduce the cost of serving the north and other remote communities. ", "4352 Despite the economic challenges of providing services in the sparsely populated and relatively lower-income communities of the north, Telesat recognizes that all Canadians, including those in remote and underserved areas, increasingly require broadband internet connectivity to participate fully in the digital economy and society. Accordingly, Telesat has been focusing on ways to grow northern broadband capacity in both the short and longer term through its investments in satellite infrastructure. ", "4353 Telesat remains committed to finding ways to overcome the economic and technical barriers to providing northern and remote areas of Canada with increased satellite transport capacity at lower cost to support reliable, efficient and faster broadband services.", "4354 Thank you Chairman and members of the Panel. That concludes our opening remarks. We\u2019d be happy to respond to any questions that you and your colleagues may have. ", "4355 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "4356 So Commissioner Vennard is going to start us off.", "4357 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Thank you for appearing before us here today and thank you for your submission. I know you\u2019ve had a lot to do with CRTC over the last while and we\u2019re fortunate that we have Commissioner Molnar here in case anything has to come up about the Satellite Inquiry report.", "4358 So I\u2019ll start our questioning off and I want to take a little bit of a different approach to it. And I want to look at the whole concept of choices, okay? And in that sense, I want to sort of look at the choices that got us where we are, all of us, including you, and where we might go in the future, okay?", "4359 We are where we are as a result of the choices that we made in the past, both in terms of our technology, how to develop it, how to deploy it, how to use it, our social policies, our business models and so on. And I think we seem to be sitting on the brink of something very new with a lot of new technology which will bring all sorts of opportunities and new business models and new services.", "4360 So what I want to do first of all is just sort of go back and look at the C-band and then move forward. And you can translate some of those new technological advancements into a context, a social context.", "4361 We\u2019re been hearing for the last several days that we have a lot of social problems that need to be solved, you know, particularly in the north, which of course is your area. And I\u2019m mindful of the fact that in your submission you occupy a certain position, which is you\u2019ve got your satellite and then you\u2019ve your TSPs and you\u2019re in that middle range there. And that is what you wish to speak about at this intervention.", "4362 So you\u2019ve got your technology up here, the C-band satellite technology and also the new technologies that are coming, and they\u2019re going to land on the TSPs that will take them out and provide service to retail customers. And so we don\u2019t necessarily want to get into that; that\u2019s not the area that I will be focusing on.", "4363 But what I am interested in is how we go from your satellite down to the TSPs and that space in between there and what new things can happen and some of the challenges and some of the opportunities that we might have. So we can think of it sort of in two different ways, the first part being to talk about the C-band and what do you see that?", "4364 Now, you have referred many times to the Northern Sky Research report in your submission so I\u2019m feeling free to count on that for some of the information and so on. So if we can just sort of -- and basically, how is it different from here to going over here, where we came from? We\u2019re here now and where are we going, okay?", "4365 So to start off, I\u2019m going to suggest that there are constraints and barriers and there\u2019s also enabling features in a large way that account for where we are in terms of our technology, in terms of the issues that we\u2019ve run into in northern Canada and so on.", "4366 And they basically can sort of gel around our thinking, okay, which we can be channelled into certain ways of thinking. We are both constrained and enabled by technology itself. It provides us with a lot of ability to do something and also can constrain what we want to do as well. And then also there\u2019s the business context too where we might be locked into certain pathways over this.", "4367 So in that sense I\u2019m looking at this as three different sort of pathways and I\u2019ll like you to, you now, comment on that because I\u2019d like to just see what your thinking is on this.", "4368 So let\u2019s just start off with the C-band, for example. What can we do with what we have and where we are now?", "4369 MR. SCOTT: Thank you.", "4370 So when you say, \u201cWhat can we do,\u201d I assume you mean, if I understand you correctly, what is it technically capable of doing and I guess in addition how much is available to allow more to be done just using that technology?", "4371 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, that\u2019s right. And a really critical component of that is how could we change our thinking or do we need to? Is there a different way of looking at things?", "4372 MR. SCOTT: Perhaps I\u2019ll try and answer the first two and then we can move to the third. I\u2019m not completely sure of your question on the third part but let\u2019s start with the first.", "4373 So C-Band technology to date has been obviously the dominate vehicle for providing service into communities. So here we\u2019re speaking primarily of what we refer to as the community aggregator model. The reasons for it? It\u2019s relatively plentiful; we have orbital rights and frequency rights to provide C-Band. It was, if you will, the first large-scale commercialized capacity and it is by far the most robust. And Michele may want to add on that side. It's the most robust. You're using large dishes. They are much less -- it's much less prone to any kind of interference, rain fade. It's a very robust traditional product, so that's why it's, you know, the dominant, if you will, vehicle for delivering services in those areas.", "4374 As to capacity, the precise amount of capacity is not public information, although I would pleased to provide it to the Commission through an undertaking in confidence; although, as you noted at the beginning, we have had quite a bit of involvement with the Commission over the last couple of years, and so I think the Commission has quite current information.", "4375 There is additional capacity available. It continues to get -- to be bought up. A number of our customers have been increasing the capacity that they've obtained from us in order to provide a higher grade of service and improve service to their customers. There is still capacity. ", "4376 One of the challenges when you're talking about C-band capacity is, of course, some carriers may be pointed at a particular satellite and not another and only have antennas directed at one and we have to be on the right polarization, so there are some limitations. ", "4377 Michele, I don't know if you had anything to add to that? ", "4378 MS. BECK: Well, so traditionally, the satellite sector started off on a particular satellite, and all of the infrastructure, the ground infrastructure in these communities were pointed at that one satellite. ", "4379 All of the satellite infrastructure on the ground had limitations. They were only capable of receiving the one pole, and that was on F2. ", "4380 And so that was fine when they were sort of building up that capacity. At some point, they consumed all of the capacity on F2 A pole and then had to look to upgrade or add new ground infrastructure to be able to pull down the capacity from other satellites. ", "4381 That has been done, some of those investments, and so they're increasing the satellite capacity that they're utilizing today to provide broadband services. It did require investment in ground infrastructure. ", "4382 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, now with respect to still sticking with the capacity, as the services will maybe be -- with the new satellites going into the future for just a moment -- you suggest there's a certain dynamic that's going to happen, which is that some services will migrate over to the new technologies, thereby leaving increased capacity on the C-band technology. ", "4383 MR. SCOTT: Yes, and again, Michele may want to add to this. We'll continue to provide C-band and we expect C-band to continue to be a service that we provide to our customers. And again, I'm talking here now of the community aggregator model. ", "4384 The Ka-band satellites, as they're brought on, again applied in the community aggregation model, just bring a much higher amount of capacity and throughput to those communities.", "4385 COMMISISONER VENNARD: Yeah, I just want to stick with the C-band right now, because I'm actually going somewhere with this. ", "4386 So it seems like there will be increased capacity that, on the C-band as some services will migrate over to the Ka-band or the Ku-band. ", "4387 And I'm wondering about the allocation of the services on the C-band. Do you see -- and again, they aren't -- there's nothing about them that is inherently fixed, if you will. They could be used for one thing or another, okay? ", "4388 And here, I'm looking at -- there's quite a large amount of the capacity goes to something like video, for example, okay? ", "4389 Do you see a way to rethink some of what's going on up there with the way that the space, the capacity, is used? And this is what I was referring to, just to give you a real concrete example of when I referred to our thinking might be in a certain way. ", "4390 Just because something is the way it is right now, it doesn\u2019t mean that it has to stay that way. And when we're looking at a lot of different social issues as well, then some things can be repurposed for something else at a minimal cost, and quite efficiently. ", "4391 MR. SCOTT: Our -- we're agnostic to what the application is. I mean, now I better understand your question. As -- if services migrate away from C-band to Ka-band, I mean, there will be additional capacity, but that capacity may well simply be taken up by existing customers or new customers. ", "4392 I mean, this C-band covers a very large area. It covers, effectively, continental North America. ", "4393 You're quite correct. It's used for broadcasting applications. Those are probably declining as well. ", "4394 C-band for telecommunication services is certainly not declining. As I mentioned, it will be supplemented and to a certain extent, substituted by high throughput capacity, but it will remain a viable and important part of the services obtained by telecommunication service providers.", "4395 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so you also suggest in the report -- certainly suggest that the cost will go down. ", "4396 MR. SCOTT: The cost for C-band rates and frankly, all satellite rates, have been declining. ", "4397 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: How do you see that playing itself out in terms of yourselves? Now, again, I'm mindful of the fact that we're talking about when you deal with the TSPs, not when they take it out there. How do you see that sort of thing, in terms of dynamics? Do you see a new business model there for reuse of -- repurposing of this capacity? ", "4398 MR. SCOTT: I don't know that we anticipate a reuse or reapplication. I think it will continue to form an important component of the -- for the services for which it is used today. ", "4399 As to how it would impact us, we operate in a competitive market and frankly, the competitive market dictates, by and large, the rates. It's a function of supply and demand and there is fairly -- there's a significant amount of unused capacity, not just from us, but from multiple providers. ", "4400 And it's a market rate. It's negotiated with our customers and the rate will be what the market dictates. We'll lower our rates as required in order to sell our services. That's the nature of our business. ", "4401 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And you are neutral when it comes to what those services are for? That's not something that you -- would anybody be --- ", "4402 MR. SCOTT: Effectively, yes.", "4403 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- should anybody be concerned about something like that?", "4404 MR. SCOTT: Should they be concerned about what our services are used for? I don\u2019t think so. In that sense, we're a typical common carrier. We're not influencing the application. ", "4405 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "4406 MS. BECK: I mean, that being said, some of our customers have indicated to us that they will continue to make use of the C-band capacity, very specifically, you know, for the same applications that they're using that capacity for today. They want to maintain that capacity going forward. ", "4407 They will augment with the Ka-band, but the C-band will provide, you know, that baseline service. It helps to provide the diversity as well, in terms of the infrastructure, so it's a different band, it's a different satellite, and it just protects and ensures that the availability of the services into those communities, is there and is available on diverse infrastructure.", "4408 MR. SCOTT: Perhaps this is a slight digression, but I think it may help answer your question. ", "4409 For example, things like the North Warning System are predicated on C-band, and they want the reliability and robustness of C-band technology, so one wouldn't imagine that's likely to change in the future. There will be continuing requirements, not just for TSPs but for certain other applications.", "4410 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, I'll just leave it at that. ", "4411 What I'd like to do now, is just take us a little bit into -- and probably the future is actually here in terms of the new satellites, new technologies, new capabilities, new capacity, which is very, very large as we can see, if your numbers are accurate and I\u2019m sure they are.", "4412 So I would like you to just talk about the way and translate for us some of these technological advancements and translate them into what you see as maybe new customers for yourself, new business models, new things that can be done with this. So if we have something like 100 times more capacity or 400 times more capacity, you will probably have a different kind of customer coming to you. And we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to play itself out once it gets out there. But what do you see happening at the level that you deal with?", "4413 MR. SCOTT: I don\u2019t think it is so much that we\u2019ll see a different kind of customer, but rather that we will remain competitive.", "4414 The nature of the satellite industry is -- our comparative or competitive advantage obviously is we reach everywhere. So if you\u2019re in the south in a densely populated and fibred area, there\u2019s not nearly as much interest or demand for satellite service. Obviously the opposite is the case in the most sparsely populated areas.", "4415 But to take a step back, what\u2019s happening in the marketplace is that everyone is simply -- it\u2019s the internet has happened, somebody said this morning; you know, convergence arrived.", "4416 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes.", "4417 MR. SCOTT: That\u2019s true. And what\u2019s happening is that it\u2019s a marketplace for blights of information at the lowest possible price. And we\u2019re competing with other satellite providers and terrestrial providers to bring our customers whether TSPs, enterprise government services at the lower price in order to remain competitive. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the marketplace.", "4418 So as we introduce high-throughput satellites, what it\u2019s doing is effectively lowering the cost per bit and bringing us on an effectively competitive or comparative footing with our competitors.", "4419 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: You know, the capacity is your product; that\u2019s what it is that you\u2019re selling. So you\u2019ve got now 100 times more of your product; you\u2019ve got 400 times more of your product. How does that change your own business? How does that change it for you? We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to it when it gets out there; we don\u2019t know that. But what I\u2019m interested in is, you know, if you have 100 times more product or 400 times more product that\u2019s a lot.", "4420 MR. SCOTT: It is but it really comes down to this issue or a lower price per bit. Consider, for example, you\u2019ve heard from several parties that they would like to see fibre into Iqaluit or various remote locations. From our perspective, the proper analysis isn\u2019t to assume that fibre is a superior solution. Fibre has large up-front capital costs; it has ongoing costs, which are sometimes overlooked. But at the end of the day you can take that capacity, look what it would cost to build, and figure out what your, sort of, price per bit will be.", "4421 What satellite offers which high-throughput capacity is its ability to be a competitive, in fact superior, alternative in places like satellite-dependent communities in Nunavut where I earnestly believe satellite is the best possible technical solution. And it will be the lowest cost per bit.", "4422 So that\u2019s where the advantages of the high-throughput satellites comes, how it shows itself in the marketplace.", "4423 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So how does the actual technology itself -- how does that translate into other expanded or different business models? Because it surely can\u2019t just be the same only 100 times bigger, 400 times bigger. Something has to change somewhere along the line. That\u2019s really what I\u2019m trying to get at here.", "4424 MR. SCOTT: I\u2019m not sure it does.", "4425 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So you suddenly will have 400 times more product and nothing changes?", "4426 MR. SCOTT: Well, it\u2019s not quite sudden. I mean, these are phases. I talked earlier about a conventional C-band or Ka satellite. The early high-throughput satellites, which have been in the marketplace for several years now, had significantly more. The next ones will have, as I said, roughly 40 times the capacity, if I\u2019m remembering my multiplier correctly.", "4427 And it\u2019s exactly that. What it means is that -- you heard from SSi and others saying they have increasing demand; they have a fixed amount of funds available to them; and they need to increase the throughput available and the bite cap available to their customers. That\u2019s what they\u2019re asking of us and that\u2019s where the increased capacity goes.", "4428 And as to how it changes our business model, frankly it just keeps us viable and competitive.", "4429 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So you don\u2019t see from your own point of view expansion into different services and that sort of thing, a different kind of customer?", "4430 MR. SCOTT: The game-changer from our perspective is the throughput, not the applications.", "4431 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "4432 MR. SCOTT: That may change with the introduction of low-orbit systems. That will be different; that is another game-changer. That\u2019s why it\u2019s being explored and that\u2019s because you remove issues surrounding latency.", "4433 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, let\u2019s go back to what you said about the game-changer for you being the high-throughput. Why is it a game-changer? ", "4434 MR. SCOTT: Because it significantly reduces the cost per bit, more so than has ever been the case before. These are fundamental changes.", "4435 MS. BECK: Yeah. So it reduces the cost per bit but the platform is capable of delivering gigabits worth of capacity over a single satellite, something that wasn\u2019t possible.", "4436 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: In your own words, orders of magnitude -- and that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in, is now that we have orders of magnitude, more capacity, where does it go; what happens to it?", "4437 MS. BECK: Into some of these communities that are looking for broadband connectivity at higher data rates and capable of supporting higher bite caps.", "4438 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So do you see that as being something that will address some of the issues that we\u2019ve been hearing about in ---", "4439 MS. BECK: Absolutely.", "4440 MR. SCOTT: Absolutely.", "4441 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you see a timeframe on that?", "4442 MS. BECK: So our next satellite launches in 2018 and will be in service the second half of 2018.", "4443 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So that\u2019s a couple of years down the road.", "4444 So you will just carry on with doing what you\u2019re doing and not much is going to change? It\u2019s a game-changer but not your game?", "4445 MR. SCOTT: But our game is the delivery of capacity. It improves our game. We get a better batting average but it doesn\u2019t fundamentally change what our product is used for -- what our service is used for, I should say.", "4446 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. That\u2019s all my questions. Thank you.", "4447 MR. SCOTT: Thank you.", "4448 THE CHAIRPERSON: Vice-Chair Menzies. ", "4449 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Hi. How much would it cost to get the north properly served?", "4450 MR. SCOTT: I\u2019ve heard you ask that question to a number of parties. I had given it some thought.", "4451 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, we go through these all the time and it\u2019s very clear that he north is struggling when it comes to that and that satellite is really the only sensible short-term project. ", "4452 So if we were to fix it, if we were to start fixing things there, which clearly the most or much of the evidence indicates to date that it is clearly the most underserved area, what could fix it?", "4453 MR. SCOTT: There\u2019s a couple of ways I think of coming at that question. Ultimately I think the answer is that high-throughput satellites will enable us, in combination with C-band, to work with the other telecommunications service providers and can provide the types of service that you\u2019ve been looking at, you know, a basic broadband service at rates comparable to those in the south. So when you are saying how much of it if you look at it from the cost of the south versus what it is in the marketplace, I think with the new improvements it can be comparable.", "4454 How much that satellite costs depends -- you used the expression the other day, you know, is it bigger than a bread box and that will sort of be my answer is it depends on how big -- is it bigger than a bread box? How much capacity is wanted?", "4455 If you add up -- if you took the population of the North and then you tell me do you want coverage, you know, east to west, is it only the Territories? Does it include the mid-North?", "4456 And we you know given the parameters ---", "4457 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Satellite communities only. I mean we are talking in just the North probably no more than 30,000 people, right? It's not like -- I mean I don't -- I understand the issues with capacity and that sort of stuff but it's not a large number of people.", "4458 MR. SCOTT: No.", "4459 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And even then if we took in North of 55, and some of those areas, you're still not talking a lot of people just ---", "4460 MR. SCOTT: No, it's not and ---", "4461 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- but they are our people.", "4462 MR. SCOTT: I'll give Michele a warning then. I'll turn it over to her in a second.", "4463 The capacity that we would bring on T19, and correct me if I'm wrong, Michele, would be sufficient to cover to meet the requirements of those people but the satellite is being launched in 2018. If you simply took that capacity and said, okay, we're applying it to satellite-dependent communities, you know, obviously you do the math.", "4464 You go back with the result. If it's more than 20 gigs of capacity divided by the number of homes, divide that by how many devices are going on or how many people are using it, and you will come out with a number.", "4465 I am not going to hazard a guess to that number, you know, offhand. I could look at it and come back to you. But I can certainly address it.", "4466 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sure. I mean one said a billion dollars.", "4467 MR. SCOTT: We can do it for -- in satellite for considerably less than a billion dollars. Satellites -- I am not going to talk about that particular one.", "4468 When we go out and build satellites for our customers, I mean you are talking about a state-of-the-art large, complicated satellite can be in the range of $200 million to construct and launch, $200 million U.S. These are always done in U.S. dollars. You know apply that on a discounted cash basis and bring it back and you will find it's not that much money in -- not that much money when comparing it to a billion dollars.", "4469 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: If it's -- I mean that's not an unsatisfactory answer but if you do have more, because at least it was an answer that said the word dollar in it, but if you can crunch that at all if it's possible and take that as an undertaking that would be useful information.", "4470 MR. SCOTT: We can do that, and if I could add a caveat? Do you have any further parameters that you might provide us to help us size the bread box, so to speak?", "4471 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, the current -- take the current target and ---", "4472 MR. SCOTT: Take the current target and ---", "4473 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- take the current target and work it from that.", "4474 MR. SCOTT: Okay.", "4475 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "4476 The other thing is the low orbit which you are anticipating; as well, other interveners have suggested that that has -- can be provided at a very low latency and there's others, projects out there that aren't part of this process; Richard Branson and others working on those things.", "4477 What are your views on those new technologies and their allegations that this can solve everything?", "4478 MR. SCOTT: Well, nothing solves everything, as I'm sure you well know or your tasks would be much easier.", "4479 I'm not going to comment on other projects. What I would say is Telesat is committing significant dollars to a low orbit system. I mean this is real money. We don't spend money for no purpose.", "4480 The opportunity that exists is to develop a service that would not -- that would address latency-sensitive applications that would have global coverage and, therefore, could be a viable solution to a number of perplexing and challenging problems.", "4481 In combination with geostationary satellites, we think it would resolve effectively all of the issues and concerns that you are currently addressing. Now, there is a long way to go on those.", "4482 I mentioned we are planning to launch -- we are procuring and launching next year two prototype satellites. There is a lot of work to be done on the orbits. There is a lot of work to be done on the ground infrastructure. This is very different.", "4483 By definition, when you have low orbit satellites that means you have antennas that have to track the satellites. In Northern locations that means they have to be protected by radomes or other means.", "4484 It's just there is a lot of work to be done is all I am saying, and we are very keen to continue to explore it.", "4485 The Facebooks and Googles, whether they are using balloons or whatever, are all exploring similar challenges: How can you get -- extend the reach of broadband services in an economical fashion? That's, I guess, the Holy Grail that everyone is searching for.", "4486 This one is in our wheelhouse, so to speak, and we see it as a very important development and one which complements our existing business of geostationary satellites.", "4487 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: What sort of timeline do you see that unfolding over? What's your best guess right now before that rolls out?", "4488 I mean there are private sector initiatives. We heard of one the other day about Google in Africa, Facebook in India, but those are actually largely populated areas. I kind of doubt that the same generous offer for free access would be extended to Pond Inlet.", "4489 MR. SCOTT: As I said, there is a lot of work to be done.", "4490 I would like to be helpful. I don't think I can answer that question right now. I would be happy to take an undertaking and try and get you a little more constructive an answer. I am just not able to provide it at this moment.", "4491 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, and really just try and give us a chance to -- I mean when new technologies come along it's sort of like the consumers electronic show where people are showing you this is the next great thing.", "4492 MR. SCOTT: I understand.", "4493 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And the next year it's not there at all.", "4494 MR. SCOTT: That's right.", "4495 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Because it wasn't the next great thing.", "4496 MR. SCOTT: You know in the big -- as I said, there are a number of things to be worked out in these and logically one assumes whether you are talking about our project or others you have heard numbers of scores of satellites, hundreds of satellites, thousands of satellites. Needless to say, whichever model you are looking at, someone isn't going to put up hundreds of satellites overnight. It's going to be a process of launching prototypes, adding satellites, adding to the constellations and therefore their functional capability.", "4497 That's why I am so hesitant to try and say certainly from our part, don't worry, by year X we're going to have that service there.", "4498 I'm certainly not in a position to try and answer that today. But I will speak to, you know internally seek an answer internally as best we can give you.", "4499 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. Those are all my questions for now.", "4500 THE CHAIRPERSON: And just for the record, that's for the 5th of May and you can undertake to do that for the 5th of May?", "4501 ", "UNDERTAKING", "4502 MR. SCOTT: Yes.", "4503 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "4504 So just a few questions. As you know, one of the issues in this proceeding is trying to define potentially what a broadband BSO would look like. I was wondering if you could help us a little bit from your perspective because presumably when you made these investment decisions a lot of factors go into it, probably the cost of capital, the competitive market; a myriad of issues.", "4505 I was wondering to what extent was future needs of residential, business or institutional users part of your evaluation or did you do a separate evaluation? Is it -- which would then help us define is it 10 or 25 or whatever? Or do you just -- did you just take whatever your clients were telling you what their extrapolations would be and you then took that as your assumptions?", "4506 MR. SCOTT: I think that's, to a certain extent, asked and answered, Mr. Chairman. I think both. I mean you have raised both ways which we would go at it.", "4507 Typically, obviously you\u2019re looking at cost of capital, launch costs, I mean, all of those, as you\u2019re developing a business plan.", "4508 The way that we put together a business case typically for a commercial satellite is -- and it won\u2019t surprise you that our shareholders don\u2019t like us to put things into space on speculation; they like to have a solid business case, which means ---", "4509 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Oh, I know it\u2019s complicated. I just want to get to the broadband characteristics.", "4510 MR. SCOTT: We would do a market analysis, as part of our business case, looking at competitive supply, what we anticipate demand to be in the marketplace. And that demand forecast would very much be informed by our customers, who we would consult with and say, \u201cWhat do you anticipate your needs to be in 5 years or 10 years?\u201d Or more importantly, \u201cWhat are you prepared to commit to financially?\u201d Because we try and sign them in advance of launching the satellite or closing the business case.", "4511 THE CHAIRPERSON: Are you willing to share what your working hypothesis is, or at least les fourchettes, the spread in terms of speed you were expecting for residential in the coming years, for residential, business, and institutional use in terms of that?", "4512 MR. SCOTT: We\u2019re certainly willing to share what we considered in our business case. I\u2019m not sure if we looked at it at that microscopic level in terms of what bandwidth you expect. We would look at it more from a commercial sense of if we\u2019re going to put a Ka-band payload on the next satellite covering the north, how much would we sell; how quickly can we sell it; who would our customers be? And then having polled the customers, they\u2019re the ones who would consider they anticipate they will have to be providing 25 megs of service or 10 or 5, whatever the case would be. And that\u2019s where we would probably draw that data from.", "4513 Michele, do you have anything to add to that?", "4514 MS. BECK: Really, I mean, we did consult with our existing customers and asked them for their projections, you know, several years out. We looked at the growth, looked at the household growth, the population growth, specific areas. We then looked at outside of just the consumer base and looked at, to some degree, you know, resource sectors, the industries that were truly satellite-reliant just to see whether or not, you know, we were putting on sufficient capacity and potentially, you know, capacity that we could see relatively quickly.", "4515 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. You understand I\u2019m trying to look at what a reasonable estimate of future needs would be, and you seem to me ideally placed for that because when you\u2019re doing investment issues around satellites you obviously have to look over the longer term. And one of the inputs would be what the future needs would likely be.", "4516 So you may not have a detailed -- and I accept that -- but could you at least undertake to see what was in your assumptions and get back to us?", "4517 MR. SCOTT: We\u2019ll undertake it and we can get back to you on what assumptions we adopted in the business case for the satellite that we\u2019re launching in 2018?", "4518 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. In terms of speed and other characteristics ---", "4519 MS. BECK: Yeah.", "4520 MR. SCOTT: Understood.", "4521 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- caps and jitter and that sort of thing, if any. Maybe there wasn\u2019t. If you could back to us on that.", "4522 MR. SCOTT: Yes, we can, sir.", "4523 ", "UNDERTAKING", "4524 THE CHAIRPERSON: Now, your view is that we should rely, going forward, not on any sort of subsidy approach but rely mostly -- well, CRTC-driven subsidy approach -- driven more by market forces combined with targeted investments from governments. ", "4525 Other parties, though, are of the view that market forces and targeted government intervention won\u2019t be sufficient. I\u2019d like to understand why you think they would be sufficient.", "4526 MR. SCOTT: We haven\u2019t so much taken a position that subsidies aren\u2019t desirable or required. Obviously we don\u2019t receive subsidies. We contribute; we provide a subsidy, at least for wireline, or pay our share of it. ", "4527 What we have said is that everything costs more in the north and we understand that closing the business case for the TSPs is very difficult. We have not taken the position that you, you know, need not subsidize, rather that we don\u2019t need a subsidy for transport.", "4528 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. But that\u2019s less for the transport, but you do acknowledge there may be another type of subsidy that doesn\u2019t target transport?", "4529 MR. SCOTT: It\u2019s very difficult. As I mentioned in the opening remarks, you know, everything does cost more in the north. And certainly you\u2019ve heard from some of our key customers. You haven\u2019t heard from Bell yet but you heard from KRG and SSi. And they certainly gave you what I think is a very accurate picture of the challenges associated with providing service in those communities.", "4530 We do this all over the globe. I mean, we provide service in Brazil and Peru and governments invest in very similar kinds of programs to bring broadband communications into isolated or underserved areas.", "4531 The difference with the north is, aside from the harsh climate and the cost of getting everything there, is the density. There\u2019s just so few people compared to -- if you\u2019re looking at a remote area of Brazil, that village or district being served will have thousands of people as opposed to tens.", "4532 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So based on your Canadian and non-Canadian experience, when looking at shaping a future-going subsidy program of some sort, what kind of elements or principles do you think we should take into consideration when shaping that, were we to go down that road?", "4533 MR. SCOTT: You have touched on them and most of the parties have touched on them. I mean, you take into account affordability. I think coverage is there and we\u2019ve talked about it\u2019s there today. And then we talk about capacity. We believe that there will be more than sufficient capacity. ", "4534 It then becomes a question of price and the challenge for those -- and I don\u2019t know whether the Commission would be better to look at subsidizing the user or subsidizing the provider.", "4535 THE CHAIRPERSON: But that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get at. Technology-neutral, is that a principle that you would advocate?", "4536 MR. SCOTT: Certainly. Certainly technologically neutral ---", "4537 THE CHAIRPERSON: Portability?", "4538 MR. SCOTT: Yes.", "4539 THE CHAIRPERSON: Others have mentioned the last thing you want, though, is to recreate a monopoly or an oligopoly. And so what do you think? If you do go down to a subsidy, somehow you have to have two groups that get subsidized.", "4540 MR. SCOTT: I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve discussed that internally at Telesat, but based on my personal experience, over time competing for the subsidy would be to me the most logical approach.", "4541 THE CHAIRPERSON: And for what period of time would one lock in the winner of a competitive process? What would make sense in your perspective?", "4542 MR. SCOTT: When I look at our business one sees, you know, what once was very long-term contracts aren\u2019t anymore for a number of reasons. And I would think the same pressures would be on those service providers. So probably something in the range of three to five years. ", "4543 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Again from a principled perspective, there\u2019s always a danger when governments subsidize things that others pull back, particularly the private sector. So how would you deal with that particular issue?", "4544 MR. SCOTT: Can you clarify \u201cothers\u201d?", "4545 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, if there\u2019s a subsidy, if you\u2019re willing to put 10 bucks on the table and suddenly there\u2019s subsidy, maybe you\u2019re just willing to put 8 bucks on the table. I\u2019m not saying you, personally. I mean a business.", "4546 MR. SCOTT: I mean, obviously ---", "4547 THE CHAIRPERSON: Subsidies can create disincentive to private investment.", "4548 MR. SCOTT: Yes, they do. And it\u2019s a distortion.", "4549 And so there is a public policy decision to be made as to whether as subsidy is required and if so, you accept that there\u2019s a distortion and then you seek to minimize the distortion. You know, the typical means used to minimize that distortion will be to introduce competition for the subsidy. ", "4550 I\u2019m hope that answers your question. I\u2019m not sure I can go beyond that.", "4551 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, I\u2019m just throwing principles out because I thought perhaps you\u2019d already have a list. ", "4552 Scalability, is that another principle that we should be thinking about as well, especially if we\u2019re thinking long term?", "4553 MR. SCOTT: In what sense? Scalability in terms of?", "4554 THE CHAIRPERSON: We\u2019re still talking about the guiding principles to setting a potential subsidy program down the road as a result of this proceeding. And I\u2019m asking you what principles would help guide us in setting that out?", "4555 MR. SCOTT: I understand. I was trying to understand what you meant by scalability.", "4556 If you mean an increased -- the ability to expand the service? ", "4557 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes or other aspects of it because of behaviour, technology; there\u2019s all kinds of variables over a longer period of time.", "4558 MR. SCOTT: Again, going back to the timing if it\u2019s renewed or examined every three to five years, presumably you\u2019d be able to address scale and continued need, very much like the Commission has approached the traditional contribution mechanisms. It\u2019s revisited periodically and, at that time, you can assess the continued need and, obviously, you want to try and eliminate subsidies when not required.", "4559 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you have views on who should be making the decisions or as to a potential subsidy? ", "4560 Some parties have suggested that it would be some sort of third party. Others have suggested that it would be the Commission itself. Even the existing contribution program to a certain degree is managed at a distance from the Commission.", "4561 MR. SCOTT: \u201cManaged at a distance from the Commission\u201d in terms of the ongoing administration but certainly the initial contribution arrangements were very much a creature of the Commission. And I think the Commission is probably best placed to make the determination.", "4562 THE CHAIRPERSON: So are there principles to be drawn from that, in terms of creating a subsidy program; in terms of who administers it?", "4563 MR. SCOTT: I don\u2019t have anything to add. I don\u2019t have any advice for the Commission on that.", "4564 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.", "4565 Does anyone have any questions? No.", "4566 Thank you very much, those are all our questions.", "4567 MR. SCOTT: Thank you.", "4576 I think we\u2019re here, as Mr. Chair said earlier, talking about some of the frustrations of people. And that you\u2019ve heard this -- I hope it\u2019s not too repetitive, but we are here to express and join our voice or our voices to some of the frustrations that you\u2019ve heard of people who live near larger cities, in our case near Montreal and near Laval, and who do not have affordable, acceptable, in our view, access.", "4748 So we are adjourned until 9:00 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning.

Now we are the largest public interest coalition participating in this processing.", "5005 With me from your left to right are Herb John, President of the National Pensioners Federation; Judy Duncan, National Head Organizer of ACORN Canada; Alysia Lau, legal to PIAC; Geoff White, also counsel to the Coalition; Edgardo Sepulveda, President of Sepulveda Consulting and an expert in universal service regimes; and Cynthia Khoo, PIAC\u2019s articling student.", "5006 The AAC is here today to help the Commission define basic telecommunication service. Broadband internet access is a basic telecommunication service. Basic broadband today means at least 10 megabits per second download and at least 1 megabits per second upload.", "5007 However, many Canadians across this country still have no access or inadequate access and many low-income Canadians are struggling to afford broadband and other basic telecommunications services.", "5008 The AAC proposed two funding mechanisms to fix this, the Affordability Funding Mechanism and the Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism. These are capped, sustainable, and workable solutions that will support reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality to all Canadians, and we believe Canadians would largely support such measures.", "5009 Geoff?", "5010 MR. WHITE: In 2016, there is no question that home broadband access is essential. Living without it is increasingly impossible.", "5011 Recognizing this fact is a necessary response to Canadians\u2019 economic and social requirements, as stated in the Telecommunications Act policy objectives.", "5012 Eighty (80) percent of respondents to PIAC\u2019s Environics survey indicated that home broadband access is essential, with 37 percent responding that it is \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d. Eighty-four (84) percent of respondents believe that all Canadians should have home broadband access no matter where they live.", "5013 As the CRTC\u2019s EKOS report observed, there has been a dramatic increase in online engagement over the last five years, with participation in the majority of activities increasing by 50 percent, and in some cases 100 percent or more.", "5014 Herb?", "5015 MR. JOHN: Broadband access is vital to Canadian seniors. Seniors who have access use it to participate in society, the digital economy, learn, engage, and be far more connected than they otherwise might be. ", "5016 Like everyone else, seniors are increasingly required by government agencies and programs to be online to file applications, obtain information, and receive assistance. In 2013, for example, Canada Revenue Agency shut down its local inquiry and payment desks, and disallowed tax filing by telephone. And while Service Canada may have forms available for pick-up and mail in person, many of their services are not available at all locations.", "5017 MS. KHOO: When Canadians are connected, they communicate, share, collaborate, and create. They not only bolster the digital economy, they enrich the fabric of Canadian culture and society in a virtuous cycle of productivity, connection, and innovation.", "5018 Broadband has become an essential telecommunications service and so all Canadians should have access to at least a basic level.", "5019 MR. LAWFORD: The next step is to define basic broadband.", "5020 In its 2011-291 decision the Commission did not define high-speed internet access as part of the basic service objective. Instead, it set a target of 5-1 megabits per second, and hoped that those speeds would within four years be available to all Canadian homes, regardless of their geographic location, through a range of technologies. It hasn\u2019t happened. ", "5021 Internet use is heavier now and users require more bandwidth. Basic broadband today should be at least 10 megabits per second download, and a functional upload speed of at least 1 megabit per second, to be determined by the Commission, among other quality of service factors. And the speed should be regularly updated.", "5022 The AAC arrived at this basic speed recommendation through research, modelling of household needs, and identifying one objective rule of thumb to help the Commission define basic broadband service, the 50-80 rule.", "5023 The 50-80 rule is inspired by efforts to define universal service in Europe. The rule suggests that part of determining if a telecommunications service is basic is if at least 50 percent of all households subscribe to a service, and 80 percent of those subscribers do so at a given speed.", "5024 Based on the 2014 data in the 2015 Communications Monitoring Report, 10 Mbps downstream was close to 80 percent, and it very likely 80 percent now or even higher right now.", "5025 The AAC also relied upon the U.S. Communications Act universal service factors to help define basic service.", "5026 MR. WHITE: The AAC believes that a significant number of Canadians do not have access to this basic level of broadband at 10 or even 5 Mbps. Evidence of this appears in the CRTC coverage map and the EKOS research, which found that rural residents are concerned over lack of meaningful access to broadband, and have feelings of vulnerability due to a lack of access to health and essential services, education, economic participation, knowledge of current events, and social needs to mitigate isolation.", "5027 Leaving universal broadband to market forces and targeted government funding has failed to deliver the 5/1 target to all Canadians, let alone the higher speeds needed today. Continuing that approach will fail to live up to the telecommunications policy objectives of enriching and strengthening the social and economic fabric of Canada and its regions, and rendering \u201creliable telecommunications services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada.\"", "5028 That's why the AAC has proposed a \u201cBroadband Deployment Funding Mechanism\u201d to support broadband deployment in rural, remote and other underserved and unserved areas.", "5029 It is designed to work with whatever speed the Commission decides is basic, and to work in coordination with any government funding, including recently announced federal budget funding.", "5030 The deployment mechanism would supplement and be separate from the existing high-cost local service and video relay service subsidy regimes. Like them, however, the deployment fund would be funded from contributions based on telecommunications service revenues, which the AAC recommends expanding to include internet and paging service revenues. This deployment mechanism would cost a maximum of $190 million per year.", "5031 A third-party administrator would identify designated and already subsidized areas, note, and design corresponding projects to award to service providers based on a minimum-subsidy auction approach. The winning service provider would bear an obligation to serve throughout the designated area.", "5032 Alysia?", "5033 MS. LAU: Affordability of telecommunications services is critical to ensuring that all Canadians, including low-income Canadians, can participate in the digital economy.", "5034 The 2012 StatsCan \"Canada Internet Use Survey\" indicates that internet access among the lowest income decile is approximately 50 percent and access among the lowest quartile is 58 percent. The average household access level is nearly 83 percent.", "5035 ", "5036 According to the 2015 Communications Monitoring Report, using 2013 data, internet use from home among the lowest income quintile of households stands at just under 60 percent. The Canadian average for all incomes is just under 84 percent. The gap by income levels is stark.", "5037 The 2015 CMR also notes that the lowest income quintile spends 8.3 percent of their income on communications.", "5038 In order to shed more light on the specific challenges faced by low-income households, PIAC commissioned and filed the results of an \u201cAffordability Survey\u201d. ", "5039 The results suggest that low-income respondents highly value telecommunications services, particularly internet access: 77 percent of respondents said home internet was an important household expense, surpassing healthcare and transportation and next only to food and housing. ", "5040 Low-income respondents spent on average $145 per month on communications but encountered challenges in affording these services. One in two respondents have had to trade off other household expenses in order to pay their communications bills. ", "5041 Many of the individual testimonials filed by ACORN members, and public comments on record, point to those sacrifices.", "5042 Judy?", "5043 MS. DUNCAN: ACORN Canada works directly and daily with low-income Canadians. Internet access is essential to our members but they are struggling when it comes to broadband and other telecommunications services, so they make sacrifices on other essentials.", "5044 The hundreds of individual, handwritten testimonials filed on behalf of ACORN Canada last August illustrate the importance of broadband to low-income Canadians for accessing government services, finding work, and for their children\u2019s schooling, and it illustrates the need for measures to make it more affordable. This afternoon you will hear directly from 10 ACORN members about their personal struggles with affordability.", "5045 The PIAC report we filed, titled \"No Consumer Left Behind\", noted that the lowest income quintile\u2019s spending on all communications, about 8.4 percent of monthly income, is well above the affordability of thresholds recommended in that report, about 4 to 6 percent of monthly income. However, the report\u2019s key recommendation was a new definition of communications affordability. Affordability should not be measured solely in economics terms (such as broadband penetration) but in personal, social costs:", "5046 \u201cAffordability\u201d means a household has choice to meet its family\u2019s needs and control over their household expenses and, at a minimum, that communications costs should not be so high that anyone is required to sacrifice other essentials. Yet that is exactly what the evidence indicates is happening to low-income Canadians.", "5047 To address this, the AAC has proposed the Affordability Funding Mechanism. It would provide a monthly subsidy of either $10.50 which we have called the \u201cbaseline\u201d proposal, or $20.50, the \u201cambitious\u201d proposal to designated low-income households. This subsidy would apply to any telecommunications service of their choice, from any service provider, to best meet each household\u2019s unique needs.", "5048 Like the deployment fund, the affordability fund would supplement and be separate from the other funding regimes. It would be capped at either $70 million or $410 million a year, depending on which proposal was used.", "5049 Finally, the Federal Communications Commission also has, as of March 31, 2016, included broadband in their comparable Lifeline subsidy regime.", "5050 Mr. Sepulveda now will provide additional information on both the AAC\u2019s proposed affordability and broadband deployment funds.", "5051 Edgardo?", "5052 MR. SEPULVEDA: Thank you, Alysia.", "5053 Good morning. I will highlight a couple of the aspects of the two funds I developed.", "5054 First, on the financing side, rather than attempt to develop these two funds based on demand, which is something the Commission\u2019s data and decisions would determine, I estimated the respective caps based on a supply-side approach. In other words, I estimated what monies could sustainably be made available by the sector. Then I apportioned such monies to the new mechanisms using the relative size of comparable programs in other countries. Using the baseline version of the affordability fund, the combined size the NCF as a percentage of sector revenues, would be the same as the NCF averaged since 2001. Using the ambitious version of the affordability fund, the combined total would be the same as the USA average. This would be equivalent to contribution rates of 0.92 percent and 1.77 percent.", "5055 The advantage of this approach is that it is based on real-world examples of sustainable sector contributions. Further, the maximum caps promote financial certainty. Also, this approach can accommodate a range of Commission decisions with respect to the size and scope of the mechanisms. For example, within the maximum cap, the deployment fund could be calculated to just fund deployment associated with a BSO broadband target speed of 10 or 25 Mbps or any other speed.", "5056 The affordability fund is also flexible. Each version can accommodate different Commission decisions related to affordability.", "5057 Second, I looked at a number of countries and models to capture the key design elements of the new mechanisms to ensure that these are workable. For the affordability fund I looked at France and Spain and in particular on the \u201clessons learned\u201d from the USA experience. The affordability fund already incorporates and indeed goes further than the Lifeline reforms adopted by the FCC in 2012 and again reformed again last month by the FCC.", "5058 In contrast, the deployment fund is not based on the traditional high-cost programs in Canada, USA or Australia. Rather, the deployment fund is based on what I denote as a \"Deployment USF Model\u201d implemented and well-established elsewhere. These models use minimum subsidy auctions to subsidize new/incremental broadband in underserved and unserved areas.", "5059 Both these new funds can be implemented relatively quickly and with reasonable administrative costs. For instance, the deployment fund is comparable in some respects to some traditional government funding programs. And the affordability fund is similar to the $158 million Ontario Electricity Support Program established in a little over a year ago to provide electricity subsidies to low-income households. ", "5060 MR. WHITE: To conclude, fast, affordable broadband access should be considered a basic telecommunications service. There are Canadians who are not connected to basic broadband who will not be connected in a reasonable time by market forces and government funding alone.", "5061 Low-income Canadians are struggling when it comes to affording basic telecommunications services, including broadband.", "5062 The AAC therefore encourages the Commission to adopt the two funding mechanisms it has proposed. ", "5063 They are costed, capped, sustainable, and workable programs that will support access to basic telecommunications services in Canada. ", "5064 PIAC\u2019s national Environics survey indicated that the majority of Canadians would support financially contributing to such funds.", "5065 The Commission, the AAC believes, has a responsibility to support universal service, and ample authority to create these funds. Doing so would not just be in keeping with the Canadian telecommunications policy objectives, but it would also support Canada\u2019s digital economy. ", "5066 Thank you. We are happy to take any questions.", "5067 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. We'll start off questions with Commissioner MacDonald.", "5068 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Good morning and welcome. ", "5069 I know some of your organizations have participated extensively in CRTC proceedings in the past, but I'm not familiar with this exact grouping that brings you all together here today, so I just wonder if you can explain what the rationale was for you coming together as one voice today? And for those of your organizations that have memberships, were they involved in that decision-making process?", "5070 MR. LAWFORD: I'll kick this off. Well, when this hearing was being planned and we knew it was coming long before you sent out your notice of consultation because of the three-year plan, we got in contact with various groups and we wanted to achieve a critical scale -- as we mentioned at the start of our remarks -- of social interest, so that you could see and also benefit from our cooperation. ", "5071 In particular, the Consumer's Association of Canada, as you mentioned, has often been with the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in many proceedings. What's new this time is the inclusion -- as well as COSCO in BC, the pensioners there -- what's newer this time is Herb coming for the National Pensioners' Federation and Judy on behalf of ACORN in particular, who we've worked with in other contexts but not in CRTC now. ", "5072 But I'm going to pass it over to Judy and Herb just to tell you what they\u2019ve done in terms of speaking to their organizations about this proceeding. ", "5073 MS. DUNCAN. Hi. Yeah, we have a history of working with PIAC when it comes to technical policy and research, and so our membership is always happy when we partner with organizations that kind of complement what we do on the ground. ", "5074 We're a very grassroots organization so we spend a lot of our resources going door to door in low-income communities, and we don\u2019t have a huge research and policy division.", "5075 So in terms of this partnership, we took the proposal to our national board, who are -- which is made up of local representatives that have been elected to our local chapters across the country that are accountable back to those members. So that's kind of the process we take. ", "5076 So then we took this to the national board. They discussed it and we're happy to have a partner like PIAC and the Coalition members to work with us on this campaign.", "5077 MR. JOHN: Good morning. This is a very important issue to seniors in Canada and to our members. We've communicated this by having discussions at our national executive board, with our provincial leaderships, and they in turn have had the discussion with their members at municipal or provincial levels. ", "5078 We've shared this on our website, newsletters, Facebook, and a couple of other forms of communication that we use, and our members do support a direction of improving access to broadband. ", "5079 As mentioned in earlier comments, the important part of this is the requirement of society moving ahead and in online forms and online access to information, to medical information. ", "5080 This is something that seniors really need, and seniors that don\u2019t have the income to be able to afford the access when it is available or that don\u2019t have the access at all, it really puts them in an unfavourable position to participate in all kinds of things that are going on today in society. ", "5081 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay, and on the topic of consultation with your members, I note that your organization, The Pensioners' Federation, has about a million members across the country. ACORN, I believe, had about 80,000. ", "5082 Were they consulted in the -- with respect to the specific proposals that were put forward, or was it more general than that, that they just generally support increased access at affordable rates? ", "5083 MS. DUNCAN: Yeah, on the specific proposals, we had the discussion at our national board level, which again, those leaders would have spoken with the members at our local chapters\u2019 meeting, but the discussion on like, the specifics, would happen at the national level. ", "5084 But as you can see from our 400 testimonials that our members submitted to the CRTC, our members are very keenly interested in affordable internet and we're really wanting to move forward with this initiative. ", "5085 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay, thank you. ", "5086 Before I get into my specific questions, I did have one point of clarification. ", "5087 In your original submission, in the executive summary at paragraph 36, you provided a table illustrating the download requirements for various different types of households. And I'm just wondering where that data came from, because you refer to it repeatedly throughout your submission.", "5088 MR. WHITE: Excuse me, Commissioner MacDonald, could you just give us the paragraph reference? ", "5089 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Yes, it was E-36 in the executive summary. ", "5090 MR. WHITE: Yeah, this is -- so to arrive at the recommended current basic broadband speed, which is -- which we believe is 10, we have sort of a multi-prong approach. There was a (inaudible) review in terms of some other -- the expertise and some other analysis of what the minimum household needs is, but we also conducted our own -- or within the Coalition -- its own needs analysis, and that's detailed more extensively in the submission. ", "5091 It's also -- and it's also broken out in response to a couple of interrogatories as well. For example, we were asked to take out high-definition video and over-the-top gaming and things like that to try to bring down that number.", "5092 But we modelled the needs analysis based on -- it's not unlike the CRTC's exhibit, in the sense that we looked at what the minimum bandwidth's download requirements were for certain commonly-used applications, and then we modelled that usage based on household sizes. ", "5093 And we -- you know, it's difficult to say what the average Canadian household is, so -- which is two and a half members, but we did it for the single, you know, person living alone; two people with a child; two people, heavy users; the so called tech-savvy household, and that's how we came up with those figures. ", "5094 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay, thank you. ", "5095 In reviewing your submission -- because we are here to talk about the basic service -- and I didn\u2019t count the use of the word \"need\", but it was in there a significant amount times; that Canadians need this, a household needs that, people need access to certain applications. ", "5096 Nowhere did I see a comparison or any thought put around what's a need and what's a want? And we are here to talk about a basic service, so generally speaking, can you tell me if there is a line between a need and a want, and if there is, where does that lay on the scale?", "5097 MR. LAWFORD: I'll start it, and Geoff might add something. ", "5098 It's interesting, the dichotomy that you're placing to us about needs and wants and we totally understand it's because you need to define basic telecommunication service. We're here to help -- to try to help you do that.", "5099 It's not in the Telecommunications Act in those words, exactly. It's requirements of users under 7-H. So requirements of users, each user, each household can be different. ", "5100 So we think we took a reasonable approach in the sense of, as we said, modelling average typical households and average typical use. ", "5101 We've been here through the early days of this proceeding and of course, there's been some discussion of whether what's basic should be limited to certain types of behaviour, and that whole issue. ", "5102 Certainly, things like healthcare and education and these sorts of things are fairly uncontroversial. But at the edges it gets greyer.", "5103 But I think the approach we took was, needs and wants, if you make it a really hard dichotomy, it may not reflect exactly the reality. And the word in the Telecom Act is requirements. And we were looking for the requirements of users, although we may have expressed it as needs in our submission.", "5104 Do you want to say anything?", "5105 MR. WHITE: Yeah.", "5106 We\u2019re not really here to talk about high-end wants and we\u2019re not here to talk about a right to movies and entertainment. We\u2019re here to advocate on behalf of what we construe as the legitimate daily needs of the average Canadian. But to arrive at, to calculate, to figure out what are the average basic needs of the average Canadian, we tried to avoid a sort of paternalistic approach by looking into a content analysis of all of the various things they\u2019re doing.", "5107 Now mind you, we had to do that to figure out the average speed that most Canadians are using, but we\u2019re not trying to second-guess the use to which Canadians are putting their telecommunications services. And we couldn\u2019t find any evidence that in the previous universal service hearings that the Commission concerned itself with the content of telephone calls either.", "5108 So we\u2019re not here to talk about high-end 100-megabit-per-second ambitions. We\u2019re talking about what\u2019s basic to get by. And that\u2019s why we arrive at the 50-80 rule. ", "5109 And it\u2019s a benchmarking tool to give the minority of Canadians who don\u2019t have that access, access to the basic level that the rest of Canadians have, rather than have the majority impose its values or its views on what he minority should be doing with the telecommunications service.", "5110 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And that\u2019s a very fair statement. You know, it becomes challenging to determine whether watching a video on YouTube is educational and instructional or whether it\u2019s entertainment.", "5111 But the challenge is you\u2019re also suggesting a subsidy in the larger number, you know, to the tune of about $70 million a year to support people\u2019s access. ", "5112 And by its very nature we know people, if they have access, are going to want to use the internet for some form of entertainment. They\u2019re going to want to watch Netflix; they\u2019re going to want to stream a video. And some may argue that because you\u2019re also suggesting a subsidy, that Canadians are being asked to pay to subsidize the entertainment of other Canadians.", "5113 MR. WHITE: Yeah. So there\u2019s no question that entertainment and video has been driving a lot of the investment in broadband networks and that it\u2019s increasingly being used as a channel for entertainment. I think the Canadian Media Producers Association drives this point home in their intervention.", "5114 So the fact that Canadians may consume -- and it\u2019s not just YouTube or Netflix; it could very well be the CBC or Health Canada videos on diabetes or palliative care. It could be things like that. There may very well be a video component to that basic need.", "5115 But we\u2019re not advocating or seeking a standard that is the gold standard of connectivity, the one gig downtown service. We\u2019re talking about a level, and it\u2019s reflected in the needs analysis -- we\u2019re talking about a level that lets not just one person do one application at a time on it, which would be a very limiting use of connectivity. We\u2019re talking about the average household that may have, you know, more connected devices, kids coming home from school, hopping onto the Wi-Fi network to use that so that they can avoid the mobile bills, things like that; children doing homework with YouTube, things like that. And there\u2019s numerous complaints about not being able to have that basic level of functionality.", "5116 Again, we\u2019re not talking about video gaming and high-end functions. We\u2019re talking about the basic capacity going into the household for a family to get by and function.", "5117 MS. LAU: Can I just add something really quickly?", "5118 Just to go back to needs and wants, we do understand that distinction which the Commission has put forward. But I think it\u2019s also important to point out needs for what? And I think the needs for what was already set up in the original notice of consultation and it was needs to be able to fully participate in the digital economy.", "5119 And so in setting a specific threshold it\u2019s not just about needs to just scrape by in your current situation, but making sure that you don\u2019t undercut the advantages of being connected to broadband. And so I think that\u2019s important to take into account.", "5120 And then just to get back to your question, Commissioner MacDonald, about having Canadians subsidize this new fund, PIAC did conduct a national survey last summer which asked Canadians what they would be willing to pay in order to ensure that all Canadians were connected to broadband at their home and that low-income Canadians were also able to afford broadband. And we found that the majority of Canadians were willing to support those initiatives. ", "5121 So you can further follow up with that if you like, but we believe that Canadians are on board with these initiatives.", "5122 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And I will follow up. That\u2019s just a few pages down.", "5123 You\u2019re here today in large part representing low-income Canadians and I want to just read one of the examples that you cited on paragraph 120 of your July 14th submission describing the TekSavvy household. And it reads:", "5124 \u201cYou know, consider the modern connected family where each user in the household multitasks. One user is using YouTube to view a how-to cooking video for the family dinner while the IPTV system to record a television show for later viewing; one adult is following a workout video from an over-the-top video service while separately streaming different music; and a child is doing their homework on the internet while listening to streaming music and waiting for a videogame to download.\u201d", "5125 I count about eight devices there and that doesn\u2019t necessarily strike me as the typical low-income household.", "5126 So can you speak to, if by and large you\u2019re here representing that interest group, why you\u2019re citing examples such as this?", "5127 MR. LAWFORD: Sure. Thanks for the question.", "5128 We\u2019re not here representing just low-income households. We\u2019re also here on behalf of the Consumers Association of Canada, which is a general consumer organization. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre also takes interest positions in that regard. Seniors as well are mixed, some low-income some not.", "5129 But apart from that, you\u2019re picking out in this particular case part of an analysis that goes many paragraphs and it has different household modelling. So there\u2019s also one with a single user and a couple as well, a number of different examples to give you a range of what we\u2019re talking about. You\u2019re picking a piece out of the middle of the modelling and it\u2019s at the high end. It was to show these different scenarios. Just saying there\u2019s 2.5 members of the average household is obviously an unrealistic thing to convey to the Panel.", "5130 So we wanted the CRTC to have a bunch of different case scenarios to explain something other a dry number, \u201cTwo and half people in the household, seven devices on average, therefore the calculus is this much.\u201d We wanted to be more realistic.", "5131 So we\u2019re not advocating for a connected home for low-income people that has that kind of usage unless there\u2019s a special situation. We\u2019re actually talking about something else. That\u2019s part of the analysis if that\u2019s a fair way to answer that. ", "5132 I\u2019m not sure if I answered your question.", "5133 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah. And you looked like you had something to add.", "5134 MR. WHITE: I was just going to refer you, if I may, to one of the interrogatory responses that I mentioned.", "5135 It was CNOC, August 14 number 3. That\u2019s where we stripped out some of what may be considered higher-end applications. We stripped that out of our model. But we still ended up at the same basic recommendation.", "5136 I\u2019d also like to refer you to Appendix E of the 14th July intervention. We looked at how some of these service providers have been characterizing their offerings in terms of needs versus wants, and some of the marketing tools that the service providers have gone to market with in terms of figuring what speed service; \u201cWhich package should I choose?\u201d ", "5137 And some of them go to this question. There\u2019s a Rogers one, for example, which show the 5 megabit connection is the symbol of one person. Or if you go through Videotron\u2019s package selection tool and you indicate, you know, one person, how many devices, things like that, we\u2019ve modelled it and it\u2019s in our appendix. We modelled the one person with a mobile phone or an iPod Touch who does one movie a week, who never plays online games, who does less than an hour of video calling a week, downloads music. And their speed recommendation from Videotron is 10 megabits per second.", "5138 So that\u2019s an example. It\u2019s not just this coalition that\u2019s saying 10 is sort of your entry level into a basic level of functionality. I think some of the marketing tools and materials also indicate that you need this just to get by.", "5139 Some of the other analyses, there\u2019s the Northern Communications Information Systems \"Working Group\" report done by Nordicity recommended a target around 9. Deloitte has observed that the average speed around the world today is 5 to 10.", "5140 So this is not the high end. This is the table stakes into functional connectivity.", "5141 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, thank you.", "5142 You are of the opinion that market forces and targeted government funding have not worked. And some may disagree with that, and I think we can all acknowledge that between federal, provincial and territorial governments, government has invested a lot of money to try and build out these networks and improve the situation for Canadians. So the situation probably is a little bit better than it was five years ago.", "5143 Can you tell me how much you think all of those collective investments have improved the situation?", "5144 Because if we are saying targeted funding won't work, that in my mind also assumes that you are saying five years down the road if we continue with the targeted government funding and market forces that we still won't be able to reach the end-game, to unfold the mission, accomplish banners, if you will.", "5145 MR. LAWFORD: I think that's fair. That's what we are saying that you are going to play perpetual catch-up.", "5146 Perpetual catch-up if you just rely on government funding and market forces, your present 5 megabits per second map which was very helpful, thank you, to get just before the proceeding, shows that there are areas without 5/1. So if 10 is now, as Jeff puts it, the new table stakes there is a very new risk, based on our experience although we don't know the future for sure, that exactly the same result will happen. You will be showing me a map in five years and I will be back here yet again asking for a subsidy that doesn't have every area covered with 10/1 now or 10/3 or whatever it is.", "5147 So that's exactly what we are proposing. We are proposing a changing model. We are asking you to do it this time, to give us a subsidy to get to those areas and it\u2019s a build-out subsidy.", "5148 And for those that are low-end income and still can't afford it even if it's at their doorstep, we are asking for an affordability subsidy.", "5149 MR. WHITE: I think, Commissioner MacDonald, I would say this.", "5150 If market forces were working you wouldn't need targeted government funding and if targeted government funding were working, you wouldn't have the complaints you have seen on the record. You wouldn't have heard some of the comments from the Honourable Member who presented before us and you would have reached the 5 down, 1 up target already.", "5151 So I think the Coalition would be asking itself: What has changed since 2011-291? What has changed so dramatically that this time around you could very well say, \"No, this is working\"?", "5152 Because it doesn't appear to us that the market forces government funding has worked to deliver that target speed and that target speed in the passage of time, we think, is now 10. So there is going to be a catch-up.", "5153 So the approach we are recommending is effectively trust but support with the funding mechanisms we have proposed. These are not to replace market forces. They are actually designed to leverage market forces. They are designed to complement government funding. They can work in parallel and the roll-out subsidy can acknowledge and incorporate government funding.", "5154 So this is just an extra level of support for those other forces that are working to get broadband to people.", "5155 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: The government funding that has already been provided has been used to fund different technologies in different areas of the country, be it fibre builds, be it fixed wireless, what have you. In any of your research are you of -- have any opinion on whether Canadians care about the delivery platform or is it only the access and the quality of service that is what they care about?", "5156 MR. LAWFORD: So others may want to add after I start.", "5157 Obviously in principle, I don't think Canadians care at the end of the day what technology they use. They may be familiar with a particular type of technology they have had in the past but I imagine they would switch if they had something better that would work.", "5158 That being said, you know, there are certain challenges in the country as you have heard from like Northern regions and stuff. You just can't run a fibre optic cable, at least not yet, up there, and so they will be satellite-dependent for some time.", "5159 Yeah, it's not -- I think at the end what people want to have is this rolled out to them, get to them. They don't want to pay a tonne. We realize that when you do a subsidy it adds contribution. It adds -- takes money off revenues from the telecom companies. It costs all consumers.", "5160 We do realize that so we are looking for the most efficient delivery at each location and we think that our subsidy will help promote that. So it doesn't really matter the technology.", "5161 MR. WHITE: Right. Just to back that up, the funding model we propose is technology-neutral and any service provider could receive this funding and can -- as long as the service provider can live up to the basic service objective that this Commission would set, then there shouldn't be a problem but there are other realities in terms of network congestion.", "5162 The reality is that satellite backhaul may be a major expense but we think the model can incorporate and accommodate some of these realities.", "5163 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: We heard from Xplornet yesterday and they are going to be able to provide a 25 meg down, 1 meg up service in the not too distant future, probably sooner than we would be able to realistically do an expansion of any wireline network. Does that solve the problem?", "5164 MR. WHITE: It might solve the problem. But I think that we heard promises during the last basic service objective review in 2010 and it's a question of, again, trusting but verifying.", "5165 And also, when you are taking a belt-and-braces approach, the model for funding support we propose, we think there is no reason to not go ahead with that to begin setting it up, to begin bringing that money online and those projects online to the extent that satellite doesn't live up to its promise. And then we get into the question which goes back to your earlier question of, well, what technology platform might Canadians prefer?", "5166 Satellite does have some issues. I think the record reflects some of the issues with latency with service outages and with price and price going to overages and caps and things like that.", "5167 So I would suggest you might believe that that could happen and it may be realistic. But at the same time, belt and braces, you might want to consider the experience from 2010-2011 and how far that's gotten us and start thinking about the funding models to support that.", "5168 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Technology is a wonderful thing and I am always surprised as I think we all are just how quickly advancements are made and how quickly things change.", "5169 So we do have this Xplornet service that is going to be coming out. Granted, we don't know how it will perform.", "5170 We also heard from another group yesterday and they were speaking about high throughput satellite that is going to be launched, I believe in 2019, that's going to have the capacity to deliver 100 megs of connectivity direct to households.", "5171 You are advocating for significant funding to build and I just -- to the tune of about 400 -- up to $410 million a year between the two subsidies. Are you at all concerned that that might be premature given that it would at least appear that we are very close on some of these technologies actually coming to fruition?", "5172 MR. LAWFORD: Technologies may be close to coming to fruition but we don't have a perfect concept with these things. We don't know that Xplornet can cover the number of households. I think it would be a crushing number of households that would try to use them all at once if they actually did that.", "5173 I don't have the technical specs on how many people each one of their birds can support, but you know contention rates with satellites are real things and although with improved latency and stuff it's supposed to be getting better quality of service-wise.", "5174 Satellite just has a lot of reasons why it is expensive; slow, doesn't work for a lot of people. Our funding is meant to get to those areas where we know it won't work. It won't work in some places.", "5175 And in some places our funding mechanisms, the deployment funding mechanism, Xplornet shouldn't serve them. There will be a better solution and it will be up to the third-party administrator to decide if there is an area of the country that they want to define for subsidy auction. That based on experience and the evidence that you guys will receive at the CRTC, I mean, that that's a prime area and you don't wish to serve it for satellite and there\u2019s a lot of evidence on the record from various individuals and companies saying that, \u201cI\u2019ve tried satellite; it doesn\u2019t work. Maybe it\u2019s faster.\u201d But their issue may not be addressed. It might be somebody who lives on a small island in the Bay of Fundy where the dish blows off into the water, who knows. But satellite is not the whole solution.", "5176 MR. WHITE: Mr. MacDonald, I think the $410-million-a-year figure refers to the combined affordability of ---", "5177 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Of the two ---", "5178 MR. WHITE: --- the high-end affordability subsidy. The Broadband Deployment Fund is about 180 million per year.", "5179 But you don\u2019t have to spend it and that\u2019s part of our message. If market forces and the government funding are going to do the job in the near future and that these satellites are going to give Canadians that basic level they need, you don\u2019t have to spend it. And there would be ways to not go ahead. This idea needs to be developed a little bit more. Time will tell whether or not Xplornet can save the day.", "5180 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I know you\u2019d leave it up to the third-party administrator, but does your organization have any thoughts on how service to communities or service to individuals should be prioritized? Because unfortunately we\u2019re not just talking about one little geography that we can tackle. It\u2019s spread from coast to coast to coast, various different communities. There can even be situations where service is available halfway down the street but not at the end of the street.", "5181 How do we triage the needs?", "5182 MR. WHITE: So it\u2019s a question of what happens if the demand for the subsidy that the Coalition is proposing outstrips the supply. If Xplornet is right, it won\u2019t happen. But if the Coalition is right, there are still going to be unserved areas.", "5183 So how would you prioritize that money? Criteria would need to be developed, obviously, but we\u2019ve proposed that your first priority would be connecting up the completely unserved people. Then you would focus next on those who are underserved at the target speed that the Commission is set. And then you would consider things like where are you getting most value for your money, the most populations served at the lowest cost. And we\u2019ve also acknowledged of course you can consider special community needs and the third-party administrator can factor that in to which communities and locations ought to receive service on a priority basis.", "5184 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So you\u2019d take a similar approach to the way the service providers actually do it today? When they\u2019re building their business cases they tend to gravitate towards the more densely served communities first and then continue to go down the pipe.", "5185 MR. LAWFORD: No, I think you\u2019ve got it backwards.", "5186 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "5187 MR. LAWFORD: Yeah. We want it to go out to places that they\u2019re not going to serve because it\u2019s uneconomic first.", "5188 This subsidy is designed so that it will not initially, as long as the third-party administrator -- well, we\u2019ll see what the third-party administrator might do. But our thoughts on it are that it\u2019s going to go to the places that are uneconomic first. It\u2019s not going to be subsidizing something that would have been built next year. That\u2019s often a criticism. ", "5189 And so the last factor, maybe the factor you hooked on there, was Geoff mentioning most population, the best bang for the buck, most, you know, population ---", "5190 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Of the underserved or unserved.", "5191 MR. LAWFORD: --- yeah, on the underserved and unserved. That, I think, a lot of the time would be what we\u2019ve been calling in the office ex-urban, just outside of cities who just somehow don\u2019t seem to be connected but they\u2019re weirdly close. Those would probably be for under the third party taking a good hard look at it. You know, they would have a better sense, region by region, of whether there was build-out plans for one of the majors or the cable company coming in and getting into that area.", "5192 But you know, if there were a persistent pocket, at the end of our calculus, after covering the people who really don\u2019t have any access or have really slow like northern areas, then yeah, maybe there would be an option of a small place because for some reason it\u2019s persistently, weirdly not covered.", "5193 So it\u2019s hard to say from this perspective. It\u2019s so, you know, far down the implementation road. But we did consider all those factors and they\u2019re in our submission.", "5194 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "5195 You touched on it a little bit earlier and we\u2019ve been talking a lot about bandwidth, the size of the pipe, in the proceeding so far, but what are your thoughts on the quality of service? We\u2019ve heard that at-home workers can\u2019t even establish a VPN connection to connect in to their office. Would you care to explore that at all? Because customers may have access to the bandwidth but it may not be reliable enough to be useful.", "5196 MR. LAWFORD: Sure, I\u2019ll start; I\u2019m not sure if others will add.", "5197 But the basic service proposal that we put before you also referenced quality service factors. And we\u2019ve heard in this proceeding and in many of the public comments that latency is a big issue for certain applications, some real-time video things and some other applications. And jitter as well can be very frustrating if you lose frames. I noticed from, you know, the VRS operator that said if you lose frames you lose the ability to see someone signing letters.", "5198 So jitter and latency, packet loss, these are the sorts of things that are quality of service issues. ", "5199 Your next question might be, \u201cWell, how can we regulate that? How can we specify that?\u201d", "5200 We have been thinking about that and, you know, CISC is a wonderful resource and it would be entirely appropriate I think to send CISC with a year-long task, or less, to tell you, \u201cSo what\u2019s the latency?\u201d", "5201 And I don\u2019t want to put evidence on the record, but in the United States for the Connect America broadband built-out they do have a 100 millisecond latency requirement for new projects under that at the moment.", "5202 So it\u2019s possible to set a number and there may be other technical things, which I haven\u2019t mentioned because I\u2019m not an engineer either, that might be added to that. And I think CISC would be an ideal group to solve that for you as well as us.", "5203 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So you think that the Commission should be monitoring that and potentially making that public?", "5204 MR. LAWFORD: Yes, because quality of service with telecommunications always matters. It\u2019s just at a certain point, you know, how deep you want to dig in the details and how much you want to leaving it to the providers to choose the best way of achieving that. And that\u2019s why CISC is a nice place because the providers, you know, they send their engineers and the rest of their folks and they work out something that\u2019s workable for them. Yet, the Commission retains its ability to say, \u201cYou know, we were really asking for this and we need a standard; can you give us one?\u201d And they say yes or no.", "5205 So I think I\u2019m just droning on here; I\u2019ll stop.", "5206 MR. WHITE: If I may just add a quick reference for the record. We were asked about this by CNOC. So CNOC, 14th of August number 5 details some recommendations in terms of quality of service and how that might be monitored and enforced by the Commission.", "5207 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Can you speak to the importance of usage and data caps and allowances in relation to the importance of speed? More speed, bigger pipes are great, but if you use your entire data allowance the first week of the month, then you\u2019re in a difficult situation; you\u2019re facing potentially a significant overage charge.", "5208 So could you explore for me just a little bit the relative importance of the two?", "5209 MR. LAWFORD: Sure. I think they\u2019re intrinsically linked. The way that usage caps, I\u2019ll put it that way, capacity is being used by providers now is not really as an ITMP as was mentioned earlier, I think yesterday or the day before. It\u2019s really used as a pricing mechanism. It has a direct effect on consumers because they have to now take the calculus of what\u2019s the cap into that very attractive price, but, \u201cNo, oh, I forgot about the cap.\u201d", "5210 So they are intrinsically linked and that\u2019s why we did recommend a high level of gigabytes -- a reasonable monthly usage, excuse me, in our basic service objective, which we put forth as the renewal of the basic service objective.", "5211 I think, actually, Judy might have something to add about data caps and low-income users and the effect they have on their usage.", "5212 MS. DUNCAN: Yeah, it\u2019s a problem for many of our members when, you know, they go with a cheap program. In the early days in the Rogers program we heard reports back from people that they had a cap and people were going over and then they were being up-sold into higher packages.", "5213 So I mean, it\u2019s just something to watch out for. If there\u2019s a heavy cap and people go over, then the salespeople can make a recommendation to adjust the plan to higher package that, you know, people are maybe not able to pay for. You know, there\u2019s a whole world of digital debt out there where, you know, people can\u2019t pay their cell phones and then they end up going to, like, payday lenders to get money, because they\u2019ve lost their job, to cover their cell phone and their internet bill because their kids are in school.", "5214 So all of these things are related and having caps is a big problem for many of our people, especially if you have kids in the household. And with homework and videos that they\u2019re using to do their homework, it drives up the usage pretty quickly. ", "5215 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You may not be able to answer this question, but from my own education, I'm wondering how governments in various different geographies across the country, different provinces, calculate their Social Welfare programs? ", "5216 I mean, obviously, they take input such as shelter, such as food, such as clothing. Do any of them take communications into account?", "5217 MR. LAWFORD: I think Judy might have something to add. We haven't gone systematically through the provinces to check on the amount of Social Assistance available for telecommunications. It's generally, we believe, not covered, and I think you\u2019ve heard that from Yukon and Nunavut already. ", "5218 And so if that is the case, that is another reason why, our affordability funding mechanism, we're asking CRTC to step up and take this step, because no one else seems to be doing it. It is -- telecommunications is a federal sphere of jurisdiction, and we think it's within your jurisdiction to do it as part of access to basic telecommunications service, funds under 46.5 of the Telecom Act. ", "5219 So we don\u2019t know. I don't know if you have any other thoughts on this, Judy, about -- I mean, Judy may have something Ontario-specific or Canada-specific to tell you. I don't know. ", "5220 MS. DUNCAN: You know, I don't know the specific calculations, how they do that, but what I do know is, the amount of money people get, if you're on Disability and you can't work and the money that you get, you can barely eat. ", "5221 You know, people are pushed to the lowest possible margin, so if you can barely eat and then you need the internet to apply for like, Disability, like, funding and supports -- one of our members will be testifying this afternoon on this, named Blaine -- you know, it's -- if they are including it, it's not sufficient, really, for people to get by. ", "5222 Like, the amount the people get now is minimal, and it's a huge problem for people even just to make basic needs, especially if they can't work at all. ", "5223 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah, go ahead.", "5224 MR. WHITE: Commissioner MacDonald, could we -- I do think the Coalition has that research, just not at hand in terms of what the other -- what the provinces and territories might have been doing in respective telecom affordability. ", "5225 I believe Mr. Lawford's right, but we do have a document that we could file as an undertaking. ", "5226 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah, if you could provide that as an undertaking, the date is May the 5th. That would be appreciated. ", "5227 ", "UNDERTAKING", "5228 MR. WHITE: Understood and accepted.", "5229 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Given that -- and I take your comments about what's provided through Social Assistance may not be adequate to support the people's, the individual\u2019s needs, that's obviously outside of our Mandate Here. But If We Didn\u2019t Go The Route That You suggest with the Affordability Funding mechanism, would another potential solution be for communications services to now be included in the calculations that the various provincial and territorial governments do with respect to how they calculate communications services and potentially increasing that allotment to account for them? ", "5230 MR. LAWFORD: Sure, it's possible. I think asking provincial governments to increase their Welfare or their Social Assistance spending these days is a pretty tough sell, and I sure wouldn't want to have to toss it to my social advocate colleagues to say, \"We lost at CRTC. Go get it.\"", "5231 I have to say, that's going to be a very difficult thing. I'm not trying to be facetious; I'm trying to be realistic. It's very unlikely, I think, that we -- they can have these things added. ", "5232 Perhaps, if affordability funding and no lifeline were to be offered in Canada with a timeline of another five years, let's say, it would be a good incentive to get advocates going, but I think it would be an extremely tough sell. ", "5233 MS. LAU: I just -- do you mind if I --- ", "5234 MR. LAWFORD: No, go ahead.", "5235 MS. LAU: --- add to that? ", "5236 So John's right. There are, you know, several possible approaches. ", "5237 One of the reasons we thought that our proposal in particular was something that was realistic and effective for the Commission to take on was, in addition to the fact that affordable telecommunication services is part of the telecommunications policy objectives, the Commission just has the expertise, as the telecom regulator, to ensure that the program, especially one that requires the participation and contributions of telecom service providers, is also targeted so it ensures that the subsidy provided is actually going to telecom services, which is something that's absent in Social Assistance, typically, that it is measurable, and is also transparent.", "5238 So our position was that the proposal that we've made in particular, the Commission was best equipped to take on -- and I just draw a quick parallel with the Ontario Electricity Support Program, which was recently implemented by the Ontario Energy Board, so in that case I believe the Energy Minister did send a letter to the OEB to go ahead and create a report and then implement the program. ", "5239 And whereas there was political support for that program, it was decided that the OEB was really in the best position to be able to implement it and to monitor and to assess it. ", "5240 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you. ", "5241 And I take your point earlier about that perhaps being a difficult sell to the provincial governments, but at the end of the day someone has to pay be it taxpayers through potentially an increase in taxes in the province to fund this, or the customers of the communications companies. ", "5242 So at the end of the day does it -- if we're all going to end up paying, does it matter that much which route this were to take? ", "5243 MR. LAWFORD: Yeah, I think it does matter a great deal because I think it could be an efficiently run program through the CRTC. As Alysia mentioned, the program can be targeted to specific telecom needs and you -- this Commission is the expert regulator. ", "5244 I guess I'll just stop there. If we get into starting to talk about the rest of it it's, you know, the design of the affordability funding mechanism, as Edgardo will speak to later, is meant to -- we've broadened the base in our proposal to include all internet service revenues, extra -- like, basically all revenues in there, so it's spread quite wide. ", "5245 Telecom users are a large majority of Canadians; it's very comparable to the tax base. So it's really just a matter between those two of which entity will better steward this. ", "5246 And the CRTC can keep it running year over year. It's not a political animal, in the traditional sense. And so it can be continued. And as you\u2019ve seen with Lifeline in the United States, although it's had its ups and downs, it's being reformed. At least there's been the continuity baseline there, and money has been getting to Americans to give them telecommunications service who otherwise wouldn't have it. That's what we're looking for. ", "5247 Perhaps it could be done by government through direct taxation, but again it's political work. And none of that groundwork, or very little of it, has been done in Canada, and we believe you're well-placed and now is the moment we could get this in place in a year, as Ontario showed with their Energy Support Program. ", "5248 MR. WHITE: It is -- I'm not saying you have this view. I know you're just testing our position, but is the hypothetical concern a concern over where does the money come from, or is it the concern that there is money all of a sudden being -- additional charges being imposed upon ratepayers or users? ", "5249 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I mean -- I guess both. You know, at the end of the day, you know, if a subsidy is put in place for low-income Canadians, if a funding mechanism is put in place to build out networks, at the end of the day, it's money that someone has to pay, be it the ratepayers or be it the taxpayers. ", "5250 So I was just trying to sort of flesh out a little bit more the pros and the cons of each potential route. ", "5251 MR. WHITE: So just very succinctly, on the -- where's the best source of the revenue? Should it be funded through general taxpayers or the CRTC? ", "5252 We think it should come from a CRTC-mandated program. We think that's more transparent, it's more targeted. We think it's actually your -- the Commission's responsibility to promote universal service, so we think it's in keeping with that. ", "5253 In terms of the overall effect on end users, how much is that going to cost? We've done costing of the programs. We've done polling in terms of Canadians' willingness to pay extra amounts on a monthly basis to support universal service and we've asked Mr. Sepulveda to cost out the monthly amount on users' bills that our proposals would result in.", "5254 We could file that as an exhibit, if you would allow it, or we could provide it in an undertaking. The only thing new about the exhibit is the cost and the assumptions for how much the proposals, which are costed on the record, will end up impacting the end users.", "5255 THE CHAIRPERSON: If you have it now it\u2019s more efficient to produce it as an exhibit. So I guess we\u2019re up to number two. ", "5256 Yeah, let\u2019s not do it like the old days and do the numbering based on which parties had finance because we don\u2019t have that many, right? So we could just do it in order. So we\u2019ll just call it number 2.", "5257 MR. WHITE: And as that\u2019s making its way up, we could walk you through it or we can give you the high-level number of what\u2019s this going to cost.", "5258 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: A high-level number at this point is fine.", "5259 MR. WHITE: So the current monthly number of Canadians who are paying to support universal telephone service is 37 cents. The Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism plus the Baseline Affordability Mechanism would result in an additional 72 cents a month on user bills. And the more ambitious proposal, so that\u2019s the Deployment Subsidy and the ambitious Affordability Subsidy, would results in $1.72 a month.", "5260 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So $1.72?", "5261 MR. WHITE: Yes.", "5262 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "5263 MR. LAWFORD: That\u2019s for the most ambitious, yeah, affordability plan. So the much larger one.", "5264 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And in your survey, just to remind me, what did Canadians say that they would be willing to pay?", "5265 MR. LAWFORD: The mean and the median are different, but the median, which I think is more representative, Canadians were willing to spend an extra 50 cents per month so that home internet access could reach low-income Canadians and also an extra 50 cents to make the internet access reach each Canadian. And then they also were more generous, slightly, with home phone service. They said up to $1 for low-income or for access.", "5266 So those are the figures the Canadians on our survey said they were willing to have added to their bill. It wasn\u2019t zero and it\u2019s not as much as you\u2019re seeing here, but it is a ways towards that. And as Geoff pointed out a little earlier, not all of our subsidy money may even be used so we don\u2019t know the exact cost just yet.", "5267 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So about a buck-fifty per month?", "5268 MR. WHITE: I think ---", "5269 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And is that per individual or is that per account?", "5270 MR. WHITE: It\u2019s per household.", "5271 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Per household, okay.", "5272 We talked a little bit earlier about market forces and where they may have not come up to the mark just yet.", "5273 Rogers, I guess for a while now, they have been running a pilot project in Toronto, a 9.99 per month basic internet program that people in supportive housing can access. And they\u2019ve recently announced that they\u2019re going to be expanding that to the country.", "5274 If we\u2019re going to mandate something, should we be mandating something along those lines as a basic low-cost internet service for low-income Canadians?", "5275 MR. LAWFORD: Can I ask you a question back?", "5276 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah.", "5277 MR. LAWFORD: What are you asking me exactly? I need to know because the second part of your question I think is a different issue and it\u2019s one that we\u2019d like to answer separately. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking.", "5278 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, you\u2019ve suggested a funding affordability subsidy ---", "5279 MR. LAWFORD: Yes.", "5280 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- for low-income Canadians. And I\u2019m trying to again explore if there are other ways to accomplish the goal.", "5281 So private industry are taking it upon themselves without intervention, without regulatory intervention, to offer affordable services. One is that an indicator that perhaps the market is catching up the needs of Canadians; and two, if we\u2019re going to implementing some new system, is implementing a basic entry-level package perhaps an approach worth considering instead of the Affordability Subsidy?", "5282 MR. LAWFORD: Okay. I\u2019m going to just traffic control here.", "5283 There\u2019s two parts to your question. There\u2019s one about is private industry going to do this and is Rogers a good example of that? The second part of your question I think you\u2019re asking about should we come up with a package. Am I right?", "5284 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yes.", "5285 MR. LAWFORD: Okay, well, then I\u2019m going to answer the package question after Geoff addresses the Rogers offer. And I think Judy may have something to add about the Rogers offer.", "5286 MR. WHITE: So I think the Coalition applauds Rogers for its initiative; I think that\u2019s great to see that come out.", "5287 At the same time, it\u2019s one service provider for one service to a restricted base of eligible customers, those who have made it through the long waitlist for social housing. And it was also brought forth on the eve of a major regulatory hearing. That leads the Coalition to say while that\u2019s great and while we applaud it, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s the solution for all Canadians in terms of affordability.", "5288 And what we also take from Rogers\u2019 offering, though, is a recognition that 10 megabits per second, because that\u2019s in their offer, that\u2019s the entry-level broadband speed.", "5289 MS. DUNCAN: Just to add something quickly to that. So yeah, in Ontario alone there\u2019s 168,000 families on the waitlist to get into social housing. So with that model, you know, it would kind of double-penalize the people who can\u2019t even get into social housing because then they can\u2019t get the $10 internet and they can\u2019t get the housing either. ", "5290 So it\u2019s not as inclusive as we\u2019d like it. It is a good step but again it\u2019s voluntary. And our members prefer to see their rights put into law and guaranteed.", "5291 MR. LAWFORD: Okay, now, for the package. This is extremely important and I want to be extremely clear about our answer as well.", "5292 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "5293 MR. LAWFORD: So I\u2019ve heard the Chairman ask it; I\u2019ve heard you ask it; I\u2019ve heard others ask it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal? What\u2019s your package for low-income people that you\u2019re suggesting?\u201d", "5294 I think it actually would be more helpful if I offer up an exhibit on this, if you\u2019re willing, because it does aid in the explanation. So if I can pass that down to Madam Secretary?", "5295 THE CHAIRPERSON: We haven\u2019t had a mid-morning break.", "5296 MR. LAWFORD: Okay.", "5297 THE CHAIRPERSON: And I think maybe that will give us a chance to actually read the document. And then you can give your explanation as we go through it. Is that okay?", "5298 MR. LAWFORD: Thank you. That would be great.", "5299 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, okay.", "5300 So why don\u2019t we take a 10-minute break until 11:10 and then we\u2019ll be able to continue our conversation. Thank you.", "--- Upon recessing at 10:59 a.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 11:11 a.m.", "5301 THE CHAIRPERSON: / LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: \u00c0 l\u2019ordre s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.", "5302 So let\u2019s continue where we were at. Mr. Lawford, I think you wanted to explain this new exhibit. So please walk us through it.", "5303 MR. LAWFORD: Thank you. ", "5304 And I apologize, Commissioner MacDonald, if I seem to brusque. Sometimes I get vibrating and my panel members were telling me to calm it down. So I\u2019m sorry about that; it\u2019s not what I intended.", "5305 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019m not that sensitive.", "5306 MR. LAWFORD: I appreciate that. Great.", "5307 Okay, so the question, the way I hear it from you was, \u201cTell us if you can design a low-income package of speed, price, and capacity that consumers who are low-income might be able to use?\u201d And that does raise some questions.", "5308 So the document you have, in the first couple of points, underlines that we weren\u2019t talking about price in our basic service objective but other issues, and to deal with the affordability issues instead rather than mandate a basic service objective or even in creating a package we designed our Affordability Funding Mechanism, which is a true subsidy, and is an explicit subsidy.", "5309 So I have to explain why, on behalf of AAC, I\u2019m very uncomfortable with creating a package the way I understand it\u2019s been discussed so far.", "5310 I\u2019m not quite sure exactly what the package is. Is it going to be an implicit subsidy? If it\u2019s going to be a mandated skinny-basic-like internet, we would very much oppose that because that\u2019s an implicit subsidy and the carriers will have to -- they will have to absorb that cost and pass it on from their other operations. That immediately distorts the market. It immediately creates an incentive for the carriers not to sign people up for this because every time then it's a cost to add another person. And that is why our explicit -- our subsidy is explicit and external to that. ", "5311 I'm not sure from the package discussions so far in the hearing if you mean everyone can benefit from it or just those who are low-income, because if it's going to be -- for example, it may also be geographically-based like the high-cost service area. Then, for example, a rich doctor in Nunavut could have a subsidized internet offering but could afford the expensive one and the subsidy wouldn't be reaching the low-income people, only which is how ours is designed, and I don't know if the Commission intends that. ", "5312 I think it's fair to say the skinny basic program on the broadcasting side has been very strongly resisted by the companies, despite the fact they might say otherwise, and that that's not an experience we want to repeat. ", "5313 And then in terms of turning this around so that the last part of this piece of paper, this exhibit --- ", "5314 THE CHAIRPERSON: On that, Mr. Lawford?", "5315 MR. LAWFORD: Yeah? ", "5316 THE CHAIRPERSON: Your assessment is not based on full evidence. We are examining whether the basic skinny package on the broadcasting side has been adopted. I think your experience may be based on what you see in the central Canadian marketplace. There are companies in this country that have embraced it. ", "5317 MR LAWFORD: And we are very strongly supportive of the skinny basic package and we are looking forward to having the pick and pay fully implemented in December and we think it will change the tune of all of that. ", "5318 But in terms of thought about creating an explicit and implicit subsidy for this large amount of money that we're proposing, our way, I think leads the Commissions away from some other problems, and if you turn to the chart now, you'll see -- if we just pick some numbers, 10-1 is the speed that we're saying should be basic right now. The capacity data cap should be 200 gigabytes is something that we put in our submission. It's meant to be high enough so that people don\u2019t trip caps and actually get a different price. ", "5319 And then price in $30 per month, that's just a guess. I have no idea. That price would have to be calculated by the Commission in proceedings with Phase 2 costing and all this stuff. ", "5320 If that amount you're trying to seek is meant to be at cost, it will be a gigantic undertaking of the Commission, and I just want you to appreciate that. ", "5321 Our proposal is not to do that. If you were to take your hand and cover up the gray part of this so it's just 10 megabits per second, $230 per month, I think that's what's being discussed. That's not what would like to have. ", "5322 We've proposed rather the bottom, which is just the two subsidy amounts. And our proposal is that those subsidy amounts can be applied to any package, and we're hopeful that the market will try to serve the low-income people when that $20, for example, and 50 cent ambitious subsidy is waved in front of them so they will design a package that's attractive to users, but that meets the basic service objective, which will be 10-1 speeds.", "5323 So if you put the two together -- so if you wish to have a low-income package, this might be a better way to create it, which again, we don\u2019t support, but if you want to do it this way, it's a change from what we've proposed. ", "5324 You can have the top line, which is in white, but you also then have to subsidize it. So the top line then becomes an eligible package, like they do with the FCC.", "5325 So the FCC says, \"If you can meet 10-1, 200, and $30 a month, if you can create a package for that, your package is now eligible to receive subsidy.\"", "5326 And then they apply their subsidies. In the United States, it's $9.25, comes off of the eligible amount. So the United States, they have gone through the effort of trying to find the eligible service package price speed and capacity. ", "5327 If you want to do that, that's okay, but you have to subtract the subsidy to get the numbers down to actually the point where people can afford it. That's the point of the subsidy. ", "5328 But if you just try to skip adding -- excuse me, subtracting the subsidy from this price package, I think you're into a rate-setting exercise and I'm not sure the companies who came to this hearing were expecting that. We didn\u2019t create an affordability mechanism as a stealth price-setting effort, and so that's my very long-winded answer to why this is a very difficult question. ", "5329 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, so I take from that that instituting a skinny basic internet service at $30 or somewhere close to $30 does not meet your objective? ", "5330 MR. LAWFORD: It does not meet our objective unless that package you create and whatever rate you set for all the carriers across the country in the $30 section is then further subsidized down, unless what you're setting is below cost. ", "5331 So if you're setting -- because what we're talking about is below cost here. Our position is that the reason why affordability needs to be subsidized is if you trust the market, that it's working and it's setting a proxy for just and reasonable rates, then if people from ACORN and others come and tell you they can't afford it, then we have an affordability problem and it's not a just and reasonable rates problem, so we're trying to attack an affordability problem. ", "5332 So you can't design a rate that will be at cost and yet reach those people, if I'm making myself clear. ", "5333 MR. WHITE: I think if I might add, there's another fundamental problem the Coalition has with the proposal, is that it's a one size fits all attempt at a solution. No one deals with one service and it restricts the service offering from an affordability perspective. It restricts the service that the subsidy recipient can put the money towards.", "5334 So it restricts household choice to a prescribed and imposed level of service that may not meet the low-income household's needs. There may very well be low-income households that have children and have greater broadband needs. There may be a low-income subscriber who is wireless only and is struggling with their wireless bills. ", "5335 So that's why the Coalition has a flexible subsidy proposal that can be applied to any telecom service and at any service level. ", "5336 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So your rationale is that because the unique needs in a particular home, they may have a requirement for a higher bandwidth service than any mandated basic service and if that home does require a higher bandwidth service, we shouldn't be restricting them to just one internet package? They should be able to apply that subsidy to a more robust internet package if that is what that household needs? ", "5337 MS. LAU: I'll just say, that's partially correct, but the way the AFM is designed you can also apply it to other telecom services. So if a household had decided that wireless broadband or a wireless plan might better suit their needs, then they could do that with the AFM as well. ", "5338 MR. LAWFORD: But in -- yes. I mean, that's part of the strength of the original proposal, for our AFM, was that it could be applied to any package that would suit the low-income person. They would have the choice and control over what they were going to pick, and if the subsidy brought it within their range of affordability, then it would be an ideal solution for them. ", "5339 It's possible that you could look at that and say, \"You know, that may or may not happen and we don\u2019t wish to see subsidies going too high end packages. Even if it fits for that particular household, we would like to restrict it down.\"", "5340 I understand that and then you're getting into not leveraging the market quite as much.", "5341 See, we are hopeful. We are actually hopeful that if there's a $20 subsidy dangled in front of the carriers, they will create low-income packages that serve most low-income people, the grand majority of them, with probably a more modest package, honestly. But there may be occasional or particular households that require a different type of usage and the market may have a higher plan that fits them perfectly. ", "5342 If the concern is that you're subsidizing premium packages, then I could see how you might wish to go more the FCC route and say, \"No, no, we only want to have, you know, this capacity of package because we're talking basic service here and that can only mean this; therefore, we have to ask for an eligible package level which is only there or better.\" ", "5343 See, that's the other thing too. Companies could beat this. So they could offer 15-1 instead of 10-1. But anyway, I'm digressing.", "5344 So the key thing for us is, sure, you can get the eligible service package within range, but there needs to be this subsidy and you need to actually make it affordable. You just can\u2019t get to -- the price you pick, if you make it below cost the companies are going to be subsidized internally with that kind of effort. So if you have an external subsidy where I put it here below it, in other words subtracted from it, that\u2019s explicit. ", "5345 The money comes into the company and goes out from the companies through contributions but comes back to them if they get an eligible subscriber subscribing to their service. So there should be some incentive for them to pick that up. They\u2019ll want to do this program. We\u2019ll be leveraging market forces to help solve affordability rather than making it something that companies wish to avoid; they don\u2019t want to do affordability packages because it\u2019s a burden on them.", "5346 I hope that makes sense.", "5347 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: It does.", "5348 Just one final question on packages and affordability before I move on.", "5349 If that basic package was set at a lower rate -- and I take your point that it may be below the cost to actually provide the service. But if that package was limited so that only low-income Canadians can access it, does that also meet the end goal of creating an affordability subsidy?", "5350 MR. LAWFORD: It can reach the goal. It can reach the goal. But I\u2019m sure you realize what you\u2019re doing. So if it\u2019s below cost you\u2019re asking the industry to subsidize it, not transparently. And there may be some lengthy regulatory hearings to set that low rate and there may be some gaming as to what our costs are and all that stuff that we\u2019re quite familiar with.", "5351 So it seems more elegant and more efficient to make the subsidy explicit. But in theory yes, if you were to mandate a $20 package rather than, say, creating an eligible package like I\u2019m saying and then take $10 off it, you could do either one and it would reach people who need a $20 package, absolutely.", "5352 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "5353 Just to move on. And I take your point about a length regulatory proceeding. We\u2019re in week one of three so we\u2019re not afraid of those.", "5354 With respect to the build fund, you\u2019re suggesting, if I understand correctly, that any company that receives the funds should have an obligation to serve all residents in that community?", "5355 MR. LAWFORD: Yes. And the way that the words \u201cobligation to serve\u201d are being used here right now in this context I believe are -- if you define an area for auction and the broadband deployment subsidy for that area is won by a carrier, that if there are homes that are not connected within that geographic area they have to build out to it. That\u2019s what I mean by obligation to serve in this context.", "5356 Obligation to serve gets more complicated when we\u2019re talking about more like duty to serve and when you have lines already existing and if someone is already on the line, whether you can refuse to serve them or whether you have to build out 10 feet just to add somebody; it\u2019s not a big deal. ", "5357 But in terms of the subsidy, the subsidy amount would basically come with that condition. The condition is yeah, if there\u2019s somebody who you\u2019ve got to build out to then you\u2019ve got to build it into the costs that you\u2019re going to bid for your auction bid because you know there are some communities in that geographic range that are not connected to the backbone or satellite and you\u2019ve got to get out there, pay those capex costs and then keep running with, you know, the ongoing operating costs. So you have to build that into your bid.", "5358 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So you would see it as a one-time block of funding to company A to build out a specific geography and then on a go-forward basis they carry that obligation to serve? They can\u2019t go back and access more funding for, \u201cHey, this house is five kilometres down the road\u201d?", "5359 MR. LAWFORD: Edgardo may add something, but it\u2019s very likely that if your operating costs continue to be high after you\u2019ve covered an area -- so let\u2019s say you\u2019ve actually connected everyone and the company that has won that subsidy realizes in year three of five, say, that \u201cOh, operating costs in this area are really high and we\u2019re going to have to continue that. And if we have an obligation to serve, you know, it\u2019s going to be difficult because we\u2019ll be operating at a loss.\u201d", "5360 Under our model, the model continues. They can apply to yet again have a subsidy for that geographic area. And we would expect that if there\u2019s continuing needs in areas with high operating costs that those would continue to be subsidized. And the subsidy would reduce every year because as you, you know, do the capex part then there will be fewer and fewer that have ongoing operating costs.", "5361 But to be honest, there are parts of this country that will probably have operating costs for a very long time that are above the market costs. But we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know right now at this stage.", "5362 Is there anything you wanted to add to that?", "5363 MR. SEPULVEDA: Sure, thanks.", "5364 A lot of it depends on what are the key criterias for the third-party administrator to determine what kind of project should be tendered out. There\u2019s a series of, sort of, framework parameters. One of them is the duration of the subsidy contract.", "5365 And so, you know, depending on the type of area, the kind of project that could be undertaken, you know, you could have a subsidy contract for 3 years, for 5 years, or for 10 years. The idea being that within that three or four years or whatever the contract is -- and it would be a contract between the operator and the third-party administrator or whatever entity is administering the fund -- that it is a one-time subsidy so that there wouldn\u2019t be expectation within that contract period for further subsidies. ", "5366 And that\u2019s the risk associated from the operator perspective. And that\u2019s one of the advantages, in fact, because we know that the National Contribution Fund will not be having to further subsidize the operator within that contractual period.", "5367 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Are you at all concerned that with that structure it may actually be a deterrent for companies coming forward wanting to bid? Because a service provider may not view it as a good thing to have an obligation to serve all residents of a particular geography regardless of where the house may be built two years down the road.", "5368 MR. LAWFORD: Okay. I think there\u2019s actually two questions in there.", "5369 One would be is there a disincentive for a company looking to enter a geographic area to build to unconnected homes? And I think, well, hopefully someone else would bid and actually scoop up those homes with a higher amount. I mean, if the bid isn\u2019t attracting any bidders it can be raised. It can be raised and it just takes more money out of the subsidy for that area because no one\u2019s wanting to enter.", "5370 If I think what you\u2019re saying -- and this is a criticism that I think Bell was trying to raise -- like, why would they go in and the be stuck with a high-operating-cost area? And then little PIAC is saying, you know, \u201cBut you can\u2019t leave.\u201d ", "5371 That\u2019s a question, you know? There normally are exit barriers when someone builds something out on public subsidy. And normally there\u2019s a period during which you cannot leave. And normally there has to be permission sought to leave, from the Commission, and I think we would support that. And it may even be that in that case the company leaving, under Commission order would have to offer those facilities to someone else.", "5372 Now, you might say, \u201cNo one else will use them because it\u2019s a money-losing venture.\u201d But if the original bid price, auction price is properly costed by the first applicant and they\u2019ve looked at operating costs, it should work because the bid should go up until it hits a point where a company thinks they can stay in there sustainably and cover all the homes.", "5373 Sorry?", "5374 MR. SEPULVEDA: And just to clarify, I mean, the way that this has been done in other places, in other countries, is that the calculation of the reference subsidy that is undertaken by the third-party administrator or the entity responsible for it, would typically not only include a calculation of the upfront capital expenditures but it would also take into operating costs from which revenues would be subtracted so that the reference subsidy that is announced, or not announced depending on, sort of, the strategy that the third-party administrator has, would already incorporate operating expenditures for the life of the project, whether it be 3, 5, or 10 years.", "5375 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I just have a couple more questions because we haven\u2019t had a chance to discuss it.", "5376 Okay, we accept your proposal. The network is built. ", "5377 It's reliable. It's affordable. People have quality access to broadband. ", "5378 Is the telephone still important? Should we be continuing the subsidy for build-outs into high-cost serving areas for phone services?", "5379 MR. LAWFORD: Yes, our model, as you have seen, continues the National Contribution Fund for voice service. It's declining. Fewer and fewer homes are staying on wireline only.", "5380 In parts of the country, voice services heard from Northern Quebec absolutely essential. Absolutely essential and there are many reasons why certain voice services are far more reliable or for emergency services, all these sorts of things.", "5381 So we kept it in. We have kept it in our model because we are in a transition phase. We are not to -- although you can do telephone that is just as good as wireline on some internet connections, on others you can't and it's not ubiquitous. We are in a transition between moving from legacy wirelines to all IP internet, which does everything and voice is just an app, but we are not quite there yet.", "5382 So we are suggesting keeping both for some time of this transition period. It's hard to see how long but in our model we kept the NCF telephone subsidy for the length of what we modelled.", "5383 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So you are not saying never? You're just saying not now?", "5384 MR. LAWFORD: Not now, but like short to mid-term. It's not an option really to remove voice.", "5385 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. And just my final is with respect to print directories. We have heard -- obviously we all know that you can access most telephone numbers, most government listings online.", "5386 And I would like to maybe hear with respect to perhaps people with disabilities, so people with connectivity challenges or senior citizens, how important and relevant the printed directory listings still are or maybe they are not important at all in this day and age.", "5387 MR. WHITE: I am just going to start off on that. I think, Herb, I will ask you to speak to the directory.", "5388 But on plain old telephone service the Environics survey that the Coalition did as well indicated a very high level of support for Canadians having universal telephone access. So not never; but for now we think Canadians still believe in the importance of the telephone and for all of the reasons John listed.", "5389 Herb, can you tell us a bit about the importance of directories to your constituents?", "5390 MR. JOHN: If I can make a comparison with the directories to some of the communication tools that we use with our members that we constantly hear and we are trying to be more digital in our communications as well because it's less expensive, it's more efficient, a lot of our members do not want to make that transition. They do not want digital newsletters. They want mail-outs for newsletters. They want mail-outs for notifications. And so we continue to do that.", "5391 Phone books are very similar. People, even some seniors that have the ability to make the transition, they are used to living a certain way and they want to have a phonebook. It is particularly challenging for people that don\u2019t have that connectivity, don't have broadband access, without a phonebook they have no access at all.", "5392 You know, the challenge becomes if I can't get on the internet to find a phone number and I don\u2019t have a phonebook what do I do then? So it is still a very important tool, probably a shrinking percentage of the population. But like the previous issue we discussed, it's not saying never but not now.", "5393 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And given that one in five Canadians have already decided to cut their home telephone, do you think wireless numbers should be included in the phone directory?", "5394 MR. LAWFORD: I mean we have not considered that in enough detail to give you a really good answer. The present costs for a phone book distribution under the BSO on demand, I don't have those numbers. I don't know how much it costs right now. ", "5395 And I don't think we have any numbers for how much it would cost the wireless companies to create and distribute those. It has never been a regulatory requirement. I think it would be a bit of a change. It may be of assistance to some numbers of people but, not being a legacy service it would take a lot more thought.", "5396 So I guess I am not willing to say start making the wireless companies put their numbers in the phonebook right now.", "5397 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, fair enough.", "5398 Those are my questions for today. I will leave you in the hands of my colleagues.", "5399 THE CHAIRPERSON: Vice-Chair Menzies?", "5400 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "5401 I have a couple of questions. The first one may be for Mr. White because you were the most determined on this.", "5402 In terms of the combination of market forces and targeted government funding being ineffective, I am just looking at data from our Communications Monitoring Report and for the years between 2010 and 2014, the percentage of Canadian households that had access to download speeds between 5 and 9.9 grew from 86 to 94 percent. Between 10 and 15.9 it grew from 81 to 85; from 16 to 24.9 from 77 to 84 from 25 to 29.9 it grew from 70 to 82 and from 30 to 49.9 it grew from 66 to 81 percent. Just a couple more, from 50 to 99.9 it grew from 58 to 79 percent and for 100-plus it grew from 16 percent to 71 percent.", "5403 But if we just go back to the 5 to 9.9 that's a little less than 2, probably a bit more, probably about 1.6 percent a year of growth, right. Then when you start getting into the 90s, it's adding growth and that's up to 2014.", "5404 It might not have changed, but I am going to speculate that it's probably up another point from there to sort of 95 percent. I mean if that trend were to continue for the next five years, albeit that that might be two slow for folks, it would have worked. It would be at 100 percent given that trend, and given that there is probably always going to be as we have seen with cable in the past or things like that, 2 to 4 percent of people who -- and this is about availability but who may not use it even if it is available.", "5405 So dispossess me of the notion that we have to do something else that it actually hasn't been working and appears to be continuing to get towards that target.", "5406 MR. WHITE: Of course. That data that you listed tells the Coalition one thing. Progress has been made towards an insufficient goal. It's towards a goal that we say is insufficient because it's the 5 standard and the Coalition is talking about the 10 standard.", "5407 But it does indicate that some progress has happened but you still have people at the 5 target. You still have households that aren't served and we speculate that you have far more Canadians who are unserved at the level that they will actually need to participate in digital society and the digital economy.", "5408 And I believe you have heard from some service providers saying every cent of government funding -- the reason are -- every cent of government funding, poof, goes away into satellite transponder costs or the reason we can't make it cheaper is this.", "5409 I mean there are persistent problems in serving certain areas and that's why we think the market forces and the government funding have been working to provide too little, too late and that's just going to be a five-year cycle of the Commission trying to play catch-up at a goal that may be too low.", "5410 So I don't know if I have disabused you of your view but the Coalition feels strongly that the 5 is not enough and that if we leave it to the market forces alone it won't be sufficient.", "5411 MS. LAU: Can I just add that I believe the Chairman in recent press releases had said that communications for services are becoming more and more important to the everyday lives of Canadians and that the public comments in this proceeding have really shown that many, many Canadians are saying we need this and we need broadband and we need it now.", "5412 And while the numbers you have cited have shown that, you know, the speeds meeting a different portion of the population have been growing, the fund which we have proposed is really to fill that gap and to fill it, we think, in the most efficient and effective way as possible. And I think it\u2019s also important to note that the fund is there to meet the need. And so if, you know, at some point all Canadians are served, that fund no longer needs to operate.", "5413 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "5414 The other question is more specific to the concept of a specific low-income subsidy. And I will frame this concern by saying that of course we all wish to be as charitable as we can be to people who are on the downside of life\u2019s advantages.", "5415 At the same time, provincial governments have primarily been responsible for that care. And none of us here are social workers. We don\u2019t have a staff of social workers and childcare workers. And rightly or wrongly through negligence or choice, it would appear that thousands of elected officials, advised by tens of thousands of social workers and childcare workers, have not deemed internet to be a basic need.", "5416 And I am concerned about us deeming that to be a basic need, based on our level of expertise in those areas when they have chosen not to, based on their level of expertise in those areas. So to me, that\u2019s an area of significant concern.", "5417 And so, Mr. Lawford, take a deep breath and particularly I\u2019d like to hear ACORN\u2019s response to that. I have a concern as well, that I\u2019ll just throw out right now, because I\u2019m unfamiliar with these matters, that should there be a subsidy, is there any risk that it might just get clawed back in terms of provincial Welfare payments or something like that? So that\u2019s a more specific question. Thank you.", "5418 MR. LAWFORD: No, thank you for the question and I\u2019ll start.", "5419 Unfortunately or fortunately, we think very fortunately, the Commission does have a pretty strong social mandate.", "5420 The policy objectives, I\u2019m not going to read them to you, but A, B, and H are very clear, talking about social and economic fabric; making sure that communications are reliable and affordable for all Canadians, rural and urban; responding to economic and social requirements of users. ", "5421 You\u2019ve got a social mandate. It\u2019s hard; it\u2019s hard work. The nice thing about having CRC look after this is we\u2019re talking about telecommunications and you\u2019re the telecommunications regulator with a social aspect. You could give it to the social people and ask them to deal with the telecommunications aspect. So it\u2019s a little bit either way.", "5422 But for whatever reason, there is a large part of inertia on the Social Services side in the provincial side to get this going. I think you\u2019ve asked some questions about Social Services from some of the provincial governments and they didn\u2019t have a lot to tell you.", "5423 That\u2019s unfortunate. So part of the reason why our group got together was we see an opportunity, an opportunity for the Commission to make a real advance here. And it does fit within the mandate that we believe you have. We believe you have the tool as well to create the fund in 46.5 to, as long as it\u2019s basic service, help people continue to have access to it.", "5424 So you have the power. Whether you should do it or not, we\u2019re asking obviously that you do, the way it will roll out -- I do want to underline one small item. We\u2019re not just talking about Social Assistance here. Our Affordability Funding Mechanism is also meant to reach people on low-income who may be working poor as well. And they\u2019re struggling and no one with social programs is reaching them. And yet, from our evidence on the record and individual complaints that came in directly to you, that struggle is reflected there.", "5425 So I think Judy may have something to say about clawback. I believe with the Ontario Energy Support Program, because at least it\u2019s a provincial program, it does not get clawed back.", "5426 I don\u2019t know, Judy, if know you know anything further about clawbacks and any of this?", "5427 MS. DUNCAN: Well, to address your question first on is it a basic need. So many of our members use the internet or want to use an internet for having their kids do homework, looking for work, accessing government services, applying for disability supports. These are needs in people\u2019s lives. ", "5428 And especially with the education, children who don\u2019t have internet at home because their parents can\u2019t afford it are going to the library to have to do their homework. So imagine a single mom who has a 10-year-old and a 2-year-old. So then they have to go to the public library so the 10-year-old can do their homework, lugging a 2-year-old on the bus in a low-income neighbourhood.", "5429 It\u2019s a basic need and I\u2019m glad our members are going to get to come down this afternoon to talk about that because I think hearing from them it will help really express the importance of it in people\u2019s everyday lives. Like, many of our members are disabled looking for things and services online.", "5430 And looking for work. How do people apply for jobs these days? It\u2019s not through looking through the newspapers and walking around with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. They apply online; you look online. So it puts low-income people at a further disadvantage because then they have to go to the library to do this. The library has restricted hours; they have a restricted number of computers that people can use; they have a restricted amount of time you can spend at a computer terminal.", "5431 I\u2019m sure that you guys have looked over the 400 testimonials, but those outline the details around how this is a basic need.", "5432 In terms of the clawback, I\u2019m not 100 percent sure if this would be clawed back. I mean, I don\u2019t think it would be put it\u2019s always a risk and we could look into that and get back to you.", "5433 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, that would be helpful if you could. Can you undertake to do that?", "5434 MR. DUNCAN: Sure with John.", "5435 MR. LAWFORD: I have to answer. But that\u2019s okay; yes, we will take that undertaking.", "5436 ", "UNDERTAKING", "5437 THE CHAIRPERSON: To the extent you can in the timeframe, right?", "5438 MR. LAWFORD: Yes, it will be our best effort.", "5439 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thanks. And just one more thing. ", "5440 Rogers suggested in their intervention that their program, their $10, 9.99 offering, that the pickup on that for qualified individuals was only 16 percent. What\u2019s your view on that? Because it suggests that the issues are a little bit more complicated perhaps than just the price of an internet package.", "5441 MR. LAWFORD: Yeah, that\u2019s a special situation, a particular situation. I think Judy has some information on how it rolled out of Toronto because her members have been recipients at certain times.", "5442 I think a better comparable so far is the Ontario Energy Support Program, which is showing higher numbers than that.", "5443 I think your question is, \u201cIf we build it will they come?\u201d Am I right?", "5444 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, yeah. I mean, there\u2019s the cost of an internet package; there\u2019s the cost of equipment, right? To be able to access it. And maybe there are other features as well which I at least am unaware. ", "5445 So that\u2019s what I was trying to get at. If you\u2019re dealing with -- because there\u2019s been some discussion this week about adoption as well, right? And it\u2019s one thing to make things available, but if people aren\u2019t adopting it, if that\u2019s a concern, which has been expressed here, it might be more complicated than just the price of the internet package. And understanding those other factors would be useful in trying to address the issue.", "5446 MR. LAWFORD: Affordability does have adoption often overlapping with it. And it is part of the problem. I agree that getting at the part of adoption, part of what we\u2019re calling adoption, that is digital literacy or the part of adoption that is disinterest, is a different issue. And it\u2019s something that would be very difficult for the CRTC to reach with a subsidy alone. And well, we said it\u2019s outside of your jurisdiction to set up education programs for digital literacy so it\u2019s something that wouldn\u2019t be addressed.", "5447 But when we take a look at our evidence in our second poll -- was it the second poll -- has asked people why they hadn't signed up and it was -- a large part of non-adoption is still cost. It may not be the majority, but it's a large plurality. It's like, 40 percent, if -- I can't get the number for you right this second. ", "5448 So there is a part you can carve off with a subsidy that will work, and then in terms of how you get the uptake grade of each individual subsidized service to be higher, there are ways to do it. Advertising it and how you roll it out and how well it meets the needs of people, whether it's set at the right price, are all factors, but adoption is a slightly different thing. ", "5449 But just because there may some adoption problems, like, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn't a big cost problem and affordability problem and that's an excuse for not addressing that. ", "5450 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It's okay. I mean, it's not necessarily -- if you can't, you can't because these things are complicated, but I just wanted to see if there was an answer. ", "5451 MS. LAU: M'hm. Yeah, I'll briefly address adoption, because adoption, I think, does conflate the affordability issue a little bit. So there are those who haven't adopted broadband yet and our affordability survey showed that for those who wanted to subscribe to a new communication service, 84 percent of the respondents said that cost was their main barrier to subscribing to it. ", "5452 So cost, I think, consistently comes up to a key barrier to adoption and the Pew Home Broadband report, the 2015 one, also found that cost is the main reason for the main barrier to home internet adoption, and they actually split out between monthly service and equipment, and monthly service, I think, was the biggest barrier.", "5453 Affordability is also about those who have already subscribed to the service because they felt that they needed it and it was essential to their household, but not -- are not necessarily able to afford it, and that's why the proposal we've made attempts to address both concerns. ", "5454 I hope that helps answer your question.", "5455 MR. WHITE: And may I, Commissioner Menzies?", "5456 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Why not? ", "5457 MR. WHITE: The concept of affordability that the Coalition has defined is one of having to forego other things, and I'm not sure we have enough information to judge the success of the Rogers program on that 16 percent figure and derive anything from that. ", "5458 The fact that 16 percent -- it sounds like 16 percent of the social housing residents have subscribed to the Rogers' 10 down, 1 up plan, and I don't think that statistic can be used to demonstrate that there is not an affordability problem because it may very well be that 80 percent of residents have internet service and it may be at a higher speed. They may have made different choices, but I don\u2019t think that the perceived lack of popularity of the program suggests that there isn't a problem", "5459 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, okay, and we can ask them. Thanks. ", "5460 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just -- you\u2019ve been very helpful, thank you, and constructive and just a few more questions. I believe I'm the only one who has still questions at this stage. ", "5461 Commissioner Menzies asked you, you know, a question about the role of other levels of government in the CRTC and Mr. Lawford, you gave an answer that addressed the legality of the Commission's jurisdiction and courts have given us broad jurisdiction to get involved in things. ", "5462 I'd ask you to address the legitimacy issue, which is slightly different than the legality issue, and you know, I can deal with editorialists who never show up at our hearings but apparently have very strong views. They personalize it as well. Fair enough; that's part of the game. ", "5463 But the legitimacy goes beyond what certain opinion leaders might think. It goes to a broader population base. And you know, you've made the argument and I'm not going to dispute it, that we have broad jurisdiction to do what you're proposing. ", "5464 I'll let you address the legitimacy issue. ", "5465 MR. LAWFORD: Certainly. I\u2019ll make this a little bit personal in the sense that from our group's point of view, we've been looking to find an affordability mechanism of some kind since the 1990s. We wanted lifeline back then as the '96 decision and in '99 kind of cut the legs out for a few -- well, almost 20 years, til here we're back. ", "5466 So all of the work that we have done with other social agencies and with low-income groups continues to point to affordability of telecommunications as being a problem. ", "5467 And the need, which is unmet since then, and it's just crying out -- it\u2019s crying out for someone to be their champion, and so we are saying, \"You have the tools, we have the opportunity right here, the Commission has looked at it and avoided the issue in the nineties, looked at in 2010 and also didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, and now we're back because the need is so great. ", "5468 I mean, Canadians would hug you. They wouldn't think that you had no legitimacy if you were able to bring something in that brought internet into their homes. ", "5469 In the absence of political backing for you, which you don\u2019t have, there's no national broadband plan. So I guess you're wondering if the politicians won't get behind us, why should we stick our necks out? ", "5470 Because Canadians really want you to stick you to stick their necks out. They really do. They want their internet and they need a champion and you're in the right place and the government's not stepping up, so that's my answer.", "5471 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for that, but these are the issues that keep me up at night. ", "5472 MR. WHITE: Can I help put you to sleep?", "5473 THE CHAIRPERSON: A few more sort of legalistic issues, just so I get your view on it. ", "5474 There's no doubt that some parties are advocating that we create a national aspirational goal, and I guess there's some benefit to that because it sets benchmarks for future bills and so forth, but setting that aside, I'm actually asking you a question on a normative BSO with respect to broadband. ", "5475 What would your view be if the BSO, rather than being pan national was more targeted to -- and these are just for instance and there's definitional issues -- the north or unserved areas? ", "5476 So that breaks down into two aspects: A) do you think that's a good idea? And B) do you think we have the jurisdiction to define a BSO of less than the pan national level? ", "5477 MR. LAWFORD: Deep breath. What is the source of the BSO jurisdiction kind of tells you. I know it's informed by the policy objectives and they're pretty clear, saying, \"You try to be equitable if not perfectly equal between regions.\"", "5478 And previously, the Commission's been very careful about saying the basic service objective is to haul up people who have bad service up to at least a basic level. So it kind of doesn\u2019t make sense to haul them up to different levels. ", "5479 And if we think of the basic service objective as having its route in 27-2, then the unjust discrimination -- I suppose you could have some just discrimination and a little bit of unjust discrimination if you had a really hard problem with the north, for example. But in terms of setting a floor, the value of the BSO is stronger there. Other policy tools or subsidies or whatever can assist with the hard cases, I think.", "5480 THE CHAIRPERSON: Your answer has an unarticulated assumption that the question was aiming at doing a lower level in certain regions. I was trying to get something else, more of the -- to the extent the market forces are addressing service level. Set aside affordability. That's a separate matter and a valid matter, but a separate one. ", "5481 Assuming market forces in large urban centres is achieving the outcomes, could we set a BSO where market forces might not be doing as good a job, plus or minus government subsidies? ", "5482 MR. LAWFORD: Oh, could you set one that's above the present -- what the market\u2019s presently delivering in urban centres right now? You mean like, say, 25 megabits per second or something, or --- ", "5483 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm not talking about an aspirational goal, but if you're going to like, jump in and say there is a BSO --- ", "5484 MR. LAWFORD: Right.", "5485 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- it may not be necessary to define one for, let's say, downtown Toronto, so but could you define one for other places that are underserved as a normative standard with obligatory input. ", "5486 MR. LAWFORD: I\u2019m going to start and Jeff is going to finish this. ", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "5487 MR. LAWFORD: Sorry I\u2019m going to just intermediate what I\u2019m hearing. Like, are you saying that in urban areas you\u2019re going to forbear from the BSO and then in other areas you\u2019re going to put the obligation in because they need to have a BSO?", "5488 THE CHAIRMAN: I wouldn\u2019t have used quite those words but, you know, to the concept, yes.", "5489 MR. LAWFORD: Yes, because in 2010-43, all of a sudden we have no BSO in price forborne areas, which is a mistake.", "5490 THE CHAIRMAN: M\u2019hm.", "5491 MR. LAWFORD: It\u2019s a mistake. So when you go to upgrade the BSO now you have to kind of reregulate them.", "5492 We want you to re-regulate them, because there may be pockets of Toronto that have, I think we\u2019ve heard it already in the hearing, maybe not, that have problems with getting to whatever you set it at, 10/1, 5/1, whatever. ", "5493 I\u2019m not quite sure if I can be of much more assistance then that. Maybe -- did you want to add anything?", "5494 THE CHAIRMAN: That certainly addresses whether it\u2019s a good idea. You haven\u2019t addressed the legal issue of whether we would have jurisdiction to do so.", "5495 MR. LAWFORD: You do still have jurisdiction. ", "5496 The -- when you -- when you forbear from an area under 34, you always keep 27/2. So if I\u2019m right and the source of BSO is 27/2 and maybe conditions pursuant to forbearance under 24, yes you can do it.", "5497 THE CHAIRPERSON: And a standard can be different at a less than national basis, which is really the issue.", "5498 MR. LAWFORD: A standard can be different at less than the national basis?", "5499 THE CHAIRPERSON: Everybody (inaudible) --", "5500 MR. LAWFORD: (inaudible)", "5501 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- so is the national standard and I\u2019m asking can it be legally less than --", "5502 MR. LAWFORD: A national standard.", "5503 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- standard.", "5504 MR. LAWFORD: Gets tricky if -- whether you\u2019re using 27/2, which is more equal or whether you\u2019re going to do it all under 24, because then it\u2019s conditions that fit every company\u2019s terms of forbearance. ", "5505 That\u2019s sort of an answer. Best I can do. THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you have anything to add?", "5506 MR. LAWFORD: I think we\u2019ll stop there. What? ", "5507 MR. WHITE: No thank you.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "5508 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. You seemed wanting to add something. Anyways, there\u2019s -- there will be other opportunities for you to address this down the road. ", "5509 I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ve decided any particular way. I just -- I\u2019m always mindful that sometimes if we\u2019re going to jump into something maybe we only need to jump in where we absolutely have to. That\u2019s the underlying philosophy. ", "5510 MR. WHITE: If I may jump in? The 50/80 benchmark we proposed doesn\u2019t ignore what\u2019s happening in downtown Toronto, but it -- it\u2019s descriptive and prescriptive of the floor that we say people outside of Toronto and in the north need to function. ", "5511 So we\u2019re not here to say -- there\u2019s a lot of things we\u2019re not saying and we don\u2019t want you to take it away. ", "5512 We\u2019re not saying internet access is a human right. We\u2019re not saying please make everyone have access to high-definition video gaming. ", "5513 We\u2019re talking about the floor, the basic functionality, and that has to be defined.", "5514 When you\u2019re looking nationally and you\u2019re looking at the interest of users, you can\u2019t ignore what\u2019s happening at the minimum level in Toronto and so that\u2019s where we say it is relevant.", "5515 In terms of could there be -- could there be an argument and I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not making -- taking a position for the Coalition, could there be an argument for a lower standard elsewhere? ", "5516 Perhaps, if you -- if you hang your hat on looking out for the interest of all users. ", "5517 And we -- there is some evidence in the EKOS survey in terms of pricing, in terms of Canadians views on whether or not it makes sense that there would be slightly higher prices in rural areas. ", "5518 So there\u2019s a recognition, I think, in your constituency base that there may have to be some differences, but I think with the 50/80 rule and what the coalition is asking for is it -- it\u2019s the floor. It\u2019s the baseline standard. It should be -- go across the country, pan-national.", "5519 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Thanks for that.", "5520 Under your proposal you seem to, if I understand correctly, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that you -- it would apply to both regulated and currently forborne areas and that -- that\u2019s correct; right?", "5521 MR. LAWFORD: Yes.", "5522 THE CHAIRPERSON: And that you\u2019d require all TSPs to provide both voice and broadband? So that would even include TSPs that are currently voice only?", "5523 So would they have to offer some of -- some voice equivalent functionality, in your view? ", "5524 MR. LAWFORD: Yes and we said it could be satisfied by VoIP, as long as a VoIP application would run. It doesn\u2019t have to be offered by the provider.", "5525 THE CHAIRPERSON: So it could be a third party\u2019s VOIP application?", "5526 MR. LAWFORD: Exactly.", "5527 THE CHAIRPERSON: Like a Skype?", "5528 MR. LAWFORD: That\u2019s the way we solve that one and then if you\u2019re going to turn it around and ask about, what about wireline providers who don\u2019t offer internet that\u2019s a different problem.", "5529 And in that case we said service improvement plans, because if you\u2019re going to set basic service to be this is basic service you \u2013- that\u2019s basic service. They have to offer it. ", "5530 However, we recognize just like small telephone companies that have two and four party service back in \u201999, they need time.", "5531 THE CHAIRPERSON: M\u2019hm.", "5532 MR. LAWFORD: And it might be four years, it might be two years, it might be 10 years. I don\u2019t know. They\u2019ll have to come up with a service improvement plan to eventually get there. ", "5533 THE CHAIRPERSON: And you consider that approach to be consistent with the policy directive?", "5534 MR. LAWFORD: Yes, if what you\u2019re doing is -- it\u2019s minimally intrusive to achieve the policy goals and I\u2019m back to 7A, B and H. ", "5535 So if you -- if you\u2019re designing a BSO to meet that, those goals in there, then it\u2019s minimally intrusive as long as you apply it to everybody equally. It\u2019s social regulation.", "5536 THE CHAIRPERSON: And how would we enforce it? ", "5537 MR. LAWFORD: Same way as the service improvement plans, which were maybe a little lax, but anyway. ", "5538 The last time, you say please file your service improvement report, where is your service improvement report, can we have it more frequently if people don\u2019t seem to be doing something. ", "5539 The Commission now has lots of other powers which are very interesting, all the way up into and including fining, if you have to. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get anywhere near there. I don\u2019t want to scare providers.", "5540 The AUC(Ph) is trying to say we want all Canadians to have an internet connection near them and if a company is unwilling to move up to that standard that you say is now the telecommunication service standard, they have to be brought along.", "5541 But I suspect the Commission will use its many tools from the soft end to the more hard end to encourage them to do that in a really reasonable way. ", "5542 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay my final question relates to you\u2019ve referred to mechanisms that occur -- that are used in other jurisdictions. ", "5543 Could you, through an undertaking, probably most efficient, help us understand the underlying statutory jurisdictions under which those programs are done, specifically France, U.S. and Spain? ", "5544 Just so we can follow whether there\u2019s notable changes in legislative jurisdiction.", "5545 MR. LAWFORD: Yes.", "5546 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, thank you. Those are my questions. I think those are the Panel\u2019s questions and legal does not appear to have any questions.", "5547 So there we are. Thank you very much. I appreciate your contribution and I think we will hear from the next -- Madame Secretary. So thank you.", "5548 MR. LAWFORD: Thank you. ", "5549 THE SECRETARY: We will now connect by videoconference to the CRTC Montreal office. Bonjour Madame Lambert-Racine. Vous m\u2019entendez bien?", "5689 So we're on break till 1:45. Thank you.", "--- Upon recessing at 12:41 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 1:46 p.m.", "5690 THE SECRETARY: Please take your seats.", "5691 THE CHAIRPERSON: Order, please. \u00c0 l\u2019ordre, s'il vous pla\u00eet.", "5692 So I see there's a large group from ACORN here. We'll be with you in a moment but we are going to have somebody first who is appearing from our Dartmouth office.", "5695 We\u2019ll now hear the presentation of Mr. Daniel Sokolov who is appearing by videoconference from the Dartmouth office.", "5696 Welcome, Mr. Sokolov. You may begin your presentation. Thank you.", "PRESENTATON", "5697 MR. SOKOLOV: Bonjour. Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. I will cut straight to the point. It\u2019s an honour to be here.", "5698 I would like to talk about TTY and how we could leverage using the existing base TTY. These are text telephones also known as TDD, telecommunications device for the deaf, where people can type on one end and it comes out as written text on the other end. So basically a very old form of text chat.", "5699 And as I had to find out in my own experience, there is no app for that and there is no web interface for that and I would hope that you, the CRTC, could help along to change that.", "5700 My personal experience was that last year, I had a sudden onset of a strong case of laryngitis. That means I could not talk for several weeks. I could have done a 911 call but I was unable to. The doctor said don\u2019t speak and it was really hard to do that and I was going to some conferences which of course I had to cancel because there\u2019s no point in, you know, going if you can\u2019t talk.", "5701 So I had to cancel flights, hotels, rental cars, things like that. I had to talk to the insurance and credit card companies for cancellation insurance et cetera. And as I found out, a lot of these institutions refused the same level of service they give you when you want to give them money.", "5702 So for example, it was easy to book a flight online but when I had to cancel I had to call them. Also with the credit card company I had some questions, \u201cCan they go on the online banking and send it?\u201d They said, \u201cNo, you have to call us.\u201d ", "5703 So I write back, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m unable to talk.\u201d They say, \u201cWe\u2019re sort to hear. Please call us.\u201d It\u2019s like talking to a parrot.", "5704 At the same time, a lot of these institutions have TTY lines. So the banks, the airlines, the government already have existing TTY installations. But it is very expensive to get one. I would have had to get a landline first, then buy one of these devices from the 1970s; they\u2019re big and I\u2019ve heard $2000 or something. It takes weeks to get it all done and then I have to cancel my flight now, today, right?", "5705 I talked to the local organization for the deaf and hard of hearing here in Nova Scotia. They said, \u201cWell, try IP relay.\u201d It turned out it was unavailable to me. ", "5706 Now, my cell phone is with Koodo so I thought their parents TELUS, they have an IP relay service. But it\u2019s unavailable because I must have a TELUS landline to be eligible for their IP relay. And also, as I hear from the user feedback that you have on the CRTC website, the IP relay service has a pretty bad record from its users.", "5707 The solution, however, that I will propose is pretty easy. There needs to be a server. It has some telephone lines going out and users could connect to that server through a web interface or an app, tell the server which TTY number to call. The server would call it and what you type in on your phone or computer would then be translated to the TTY code and this way you could initiate a conversation with your bank, with the government. For example, at that time I also had questions with the Canada Revenue Agency; don\u2019t get me started on that one. It\u2019s complicated.", "5708 So they have the TTY lines but I was unable to use them.", "5709 The advantages of that would be that it\u2019s immediate; it\u2019s a very, very fast deployment; it\u2019s updateable. If there is a new protocol you could update the service. It could also be multi protocols so you could call international numbers. Some countries have other technical protocols for TTY and if you have a machine that does the Canadian one and maybe doesn\u2019t do the, I don\u2019t know, Italian one. ", "5710 It\u2019s much cheaper than IP relay because you don\u2019t need agents in between. It\u2019s available 24/7. There\u2019s less that gets lost in translation. And you have no privacy implications. It\u2019s sometimes not nice, you know, some random call-centre agent doing an IP relay you have to tell them your financial or your health issues. Even family members, that\u2019s what I got to, friends and family members, to make these calls to cancel my flights and file my insurance claims.", "5711 But that\u2019s a hassle to them; things get lost in translation and they have to call them again. Everything is a frustration. And I was very surprised that there is no simple way today to have a virtual TTY device.", "5712 I hope you can help bring that on and I\u2019m looking forward to your questions.", "5713 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you very much.", "5714 Commissioner Vennard will start us off.", "5715 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Hello. Thank you very much for appearing with us today. And I can certainly sympathize with the situation you were in having experienced that myself about 10 years ago. So there\u2019s nothing like a personal experience for us to understand things that we take for granted that other people deal with every day.", "5716 Now, a couple of things I want to ask you about and then I want to talk about a couple of other things after that too.", "5717 First of all, you talked a little bit about an app, that you think an app would be useful and would be a good solution for this?", "5718 MR. SOKOLOV: Yeah. Yeah, I believe it would be both, a web interface where you can use a keyboard or an app on a phone because then you\u2019re mobile; you can do it anywhere. You don\u2019t need to go home to your computer.", "5719 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. Who do you think should be responsible for that? I mean, it would be great if something like that were there, but somebody has to actually put it in and so on. So could you maybe give us a bit of feedback on how you think that could happen from a practical, just a purely pragmatic point of view?", "5720 MR. SOKOLOV: I think it should be someone who has experience either with telecommunications or IT stuff. I think if there was a call seeing who comes forward, it could be a telecommunications company; it could be someone like Google. It could maybe be an organization that has a user base in the deaf and hard of hearing community. ", "5721 It\u2019s not super difficult so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really so important who does it. Someone who\u2019s reliable and who would not sell, you know, your data or what you type in and disclose that.", "5722 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: You mentioned that you contacted a deaf and hard of hearing society where you live. Do you think that you might want to approach them with this sort of an idea?", "5723 MR. SOKOLOV: Well, I have but -- well, I discussed it with them but yeah, I don\u2019t think they themselves can do it.", "5724 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. What about within a medical context too? Because oftentimes when we\u2019re faced with unexpected medical conditions there is a temporary or in some cases permanent assistance that is provided to people who are in situations like that. Is there anything like that that you could have gone after?", "5725 MR. SOKOLOV: I\u2019m unaware of that.", "5726 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. The reason I mention these two things is that we\u2019re doing the hearing on the basic service objective. And I can appreciate that, you know, maybe we should be thinking about something like this. But in terms of solving the actual practical problem there\u2019s maybe a few other organizations that might be able to do something with that as well.", "5727 MR. SOKOLOV: I think it should be approached from the telecommunications or IT side. I don\u2019t see it really as a medical service.", "5728 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So you see this as being something that should be, like, under our domain, CRTC?", "5729 MR. SOKOLOV: Yes. Yes, I would think so. And you have an existing base of TTY devices out there. So far the focus is usually on the deaf and hard of hearing, but there\u2019s also a large group of people who have speech impairments of various kinds who could make use of that. ", "5730 And all that\u2019s missing is really the technical link. It\u2019s not so much of a social service or medical service thing.", "5731 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, I take that. Thank you very much for brining that to our attention.", "5732 In your submission you also talk about a directory and how you would like to be listed in a directory?", "5733 MR. SOKOLOV: Oh yeah, that was part of my written submissions yes, a telephone directory.", "5734 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes.", "5735 MR. SOKOLOV: Yeah, it would be nice to be in there.", "5736 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Would you give us your viewpoint on that and maybe some suggestions for us on what we should think about?", "5737 MR. SOKOLOV: Well, I was given the go-around. As I mentioned, I have a Koodo cell phone and when I signed up for that I was expecting that to be an easy thing, to tick a box instead or, you know, choose, do I want to be in the directory or not? But it seems that the default is you are not. ", "5738 And I asked Koodo and they said, \u201cYou have to go to Bell Aliant because they\u2019re in your local area.\u201d And I went to Bell Aliant and they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not one of our customers so go to your provider,\u201d which was Koodo. So you know, I did that twice back and forth and eventually I gave up. And five years down the road I still don\u2019t have entry in the telephone directory.", "5739 I think there should be one company responsible for compiling the date, from drawing it from the various providers, and also offering it to anyone who wants to print or publish electronically a telephone directory at a reasonable price.", "5740 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. In addition to your own mobile phone number and so on, what other information do you think would be useful to have in a directory?", "5741 MR. SOKOLOV: I think it should be up to the individual citizen or user what they want to have in there. But there should be an option to put in an address, maybe just the town you\u2019re in or the exact address. I\u2019ve seen some countries also put in professions mentioned in the telephone directory. ", "5742 And then I think there could be updates that you pay for, like a highlighted entry, something with colours, something with a picture. But that would not be something I would expect to be mandated. I think the extras and add-ons, that would be between the user and the actual publisher of a directory if they want to offer that.", "5743 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. What other information do you think might be useful, for example, how to register on the national do-not-call list and that sort of thing? What other numbers do you think would be useful to be in an online directory?", "5744 MR. SOKOLOV: Email addresses if the user wants to have it in there.", "5745 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "5746 MR. SOKOLOV: Yeah. I think there is a lot of things you can provide in a telephone directory; maps of the area, but I don't think that those things like, I don't think, they need to be mandated. That could be up to the ingenuity of the publisher of the telephone directory what things they want to add on.", "5747 I think the basic thing is that every Canadian has a telephone and they want to be in a directory it should be possible.", "5748 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Do you think ---", "5749 MR. SOKOLOV: We shouldn't be sent around because we are with the wrong provider. Because if I had gone with Bell Aliant that would have been easy to be in there.", "5750 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, and the other situation might have been handled differently too and you might have had a different resolution to that as well.", "5751 Can you make some comments on whether or not you think a printed directory is a useful item to still have?", "5752 MR. SOKOLOV: I think it is useful, yes. I don\u2019t think that anybody must get one.", "5753 I have seen where some other countries they send you a postcard and so if you want to have a telephone printout -- telephone directory -- just return the postcard with your address on it, similar to the information you get from the biller registration before the election. You just put it back in the mailbox and then they will send you a printed telephone directory.", "5754 If you don't want a telephone directory you just discard that card that they send you. That way people who want it will get one, and those people who don\u2019t would not get one.", "5755 Here in my area it's we get them delivered, a whole stack once a year. They put that in the lobby of the apartment building and then whoever wants one, takes one.", "5756 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "5757 MR. SOKOLOV: But I don't know if that's -- what is more cost-efficient.", "5758 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. A question now that I am going to put to you wasn't in your submission but it's relevant to what our hearing is about.", "5759 And here I want to ask you, to what extent do you think that applications on a -- that are used through the internet such as entertainment services should be taken into account when assessing the internet characteristics needed by Canadians?", "5760 MR. SOKOLOV: I think it's very hard to draw a strict line between what is information and what is entertainment.", "5761 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "5762 MR. SOKOLOV: So I think that is -- I think it should be taken into account because you just can't simply say this is where information ends and this is where entertainment begins.", "5763 Just as an example, I have been watching the client base and it was a fun thing for them in Quebec in French which mocked news and it was animated. It was very entertaining but it also gave a lot of information on current political things that were going on.", "5764 And then I think entertainment is also a very human thing. It's something that makes us human. So just to ignore that, I don't think it would be wise.", "5765 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you. Those are my questions and I will pass you over to my colleagues.", "5766 THE CHAIRPERSON: So I was checking with my colleagues if there were any questions. So you were quite clear. So thank you very much. There are no further questions for you.", "5767 Thank you for having participated.", "5768 MR. SOKOLOV: Okay, thanks. Have a good hearing. Thank you.", "5769 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.", "5770 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "5771 THE SECRETARY: Merci. We will now hear the presentations by five ACORN members. Three members are appearing from here in Gatineau and two from the Toronto CRTC office. We will hear all five presentations which will then be followed by questions from the members.", "5772 Please introduce yourselves before beginning and you will each have 5 minutes for your presentation. We will start with the presentation by Diane Rochon.", "5773 Ms. Rochon, you may begin.", "5790 LA SECR\u00c9TAIRE: Merci. Nous entendrons maintenant -- we will now hear the presentation of Blaine Cameron.", "PRESENTATION", "5791 MR. CAMERON: Thanks for having me. My name is Blaine Cameron. I am an ACORN member. I am here to talk to you about the cost of internet for low-income people like myself.", "5792 I am a resident of Ottawa and have been so for most of my adult life. My income is from Ontario Disability Support Program and CPP Disability. About 70 percent of my income is devoted to shelter, leaving only about 30 percent of my income for bill payments and food.", "5793 My income is of such a low rate that I have to rely on family to help supplement me or supplement it. I know I am -- I know of many others in my community who are not as fortunate as I and their physical and mental health suffers greatly for it. People like that and myself are most in need of access to the patchwork of community and government services, services which are now mostly accessed online.", "5794 Right now -- sorry -- being disabled as you can see, is often a barrier to physically accessing these resources and it is primarily through the internet that I can -- I and others have access to them.", "5795 Right now I am applying for direct funding which is a self-managed attendant service for the disabled. I access this program and communicate with the staff online and by phone. Without internet I would not have been able to easily find the program and the program itself will assist me in day to day tasks that make -- that I would otherwise be able to do if it were not for my disability such as showering, dressing, food preparation; housekeeping.", "5796 With this program I now have more ability or I would have more ability to participate in the community, society and employment. But being self-managed would mean I am required to file taxes and benefits from my employees. Remittances would occur each month and having access to online resources is quite necessary.", "5797 In terms of transportation, my only form of transportation is through public transit.", "5798 Having access to the internet allows me to easily plan my bus trips so I can attend doctors\u2019 appointments, get my wheelchair serviced, participate in power chair sports, socialize, and fully participate in organizations like ACORN.", "5799 Having the access to internet allows me to be an informed individual and citizen. I am able to follow city, provincial, federal, and world issues and often can get in-depth knowledge.", "5800 In regards to my internet costs, I\u2019m fortunate to share it with a roommate and pay approximately $20 a month. Now, the only reason I do have a roommate is because I cannot afford to have my own place. Most one bedroom apartments are $1,000 a month, which is basically my entire cheque.", "5801 Living in poverty and being disabled forces me to make choices I don\u2019t want to and having a roommate allows me to scrape together some funds from my budget to pay for this utility and connect to the outside world.", "5802 Because I\u2019m disabled and poor I\u2019m denied certain things. I didn\u2019t choose to be poor and disabled and many other people don\u2019t choose to be poor.", "5803 For me, affordable internet means being connected to places I cannot access and it connects me to programs that help reduce the day-to-day barriers that I face.", "5804 Being poor and having to pay for exorbitant internet costs makes me feel that people like myself don\u2019t matter much and don\u2019t deserve consideration. I wouldn\u2019t want to imagine my life without the internet; it\u2019s my access to the world as a disabled person.", "5805 Thanks for your time.", "5806 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "5807 We\u2019ll now hear the presentation of Tina Ford.", "PRESENTATION ", "5808 MS. FORD: Hello. My name is Tina Ford and I am a low-income person and I am a member of ACORN Canada. I am here to tell you why we need affordable internet.", "5809 I recently lost my job and I am currently looking for work, which is very difficult. I am a trained Housing First worker. I have skills working with the homeless population in Ottawa but finding work is hard.", "5810 I need the internet at home so I can access different employment centres. I have to apply for jobs online. No employer accepts paper r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and everything has to be by email. ", "5811 I am a single parents and I have two boys who also need the internet. They are looking for jobs and registering for college courses. They also need to continue to upgrade their computer skills at home to be successful in the world.", "5812 My income now is $700 a month. I am on Ontario Works until May when my EI kicks in. My internet bill last month was $170 and I could only pay half of it.", "5813 Because I paid this bill I could not buy fruits or vegetables or meat for my family. I am taking money out of my food budget so I can for the internet to find a job and support my family. It\u2019s now a constant struggle every month.", "5814 I will have to pay some of the bill again this month, and if I will, I\u2019ll have to go to Money Mart to borrow money to pay the bill and feed my kids.", "5815 The internet also helps me to check the status of the report of my EI and plan my budget. Otherwise I would have to walk to the employment centre, which is 20 to 30 minutes away since now I can\u2019t afford a bus pass I have to walk there.", "5816 I am able to easily see the progress and changes to my file or makes on my claim online and I really enjoy doing that. And I really need to have internet to do things like that.", "5817 If I cannot find work I will go back to school and upgrade my skills and still I need the internet to succeed. And like, I can\u2019t not get anywhere; it\u2019s really hindering me. If I don\u2019t have internet I can\u2019t move forward anyway. So it\u2019s really, really hard.", "5818 The internet, lastly, allows me to stay connected to news and civic events since I cannot afford cable or basic information networks. ", "5819 Internet is a necessity for me and I would like to have affordable internet so I can get a job, manage my bills, and so I don\u2019t have to take Welfare.", "5820 If I had affordable internet rates it would allow me to buy healthy food, balance my budget, prevent me from going to the payday lender, or buy a bus pass.", "5821 I am not alone in this struggle and there are many families that need affordable internet to improve their lives. Internet is a need; it is not something that we just want. It\u2019s a need for low-income people and single parents and for youth that are coming from low-income families.", "5822 Thank you for listening to my story.", "5823 THE SECRETARY: We will now hear the presentation of Kelly Lalonde from the Toronto CRTC office.", "PRESENTATION ", "5824 MS. LALONDE: Hello. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about how I think the internet is essential in people\u2019s lives.", "5825 It is something that matters very deeply to me. My name is Kelly Lalonde. I am a renter in East York here in Toronto. I live on a fixed income with Ontario Disability Support Program and I pick up jobs on the side to increase that income.", "5826 It is very difficult for me to get by and money is very tight. I half-support my son who now lives on his own. He just turned 32 yesterday. We both struggle to stay online, but I feel it is a necessity in our everyday lives.", "5827 How is the internet a need and not a want? Well, let me explain. My son and I need the internet so we can try to find jobs. These days all the jobs are online and very few are found on paper. ", "5828 My son and I use a website called Indeed.com to find work. We have our r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on file with them and they send me job postings to my email.", "5829 If we were not online we would not be able to apply for these jobs in a timely manner. It\u2019s hard enough to get work when I am online; imagine how hard it would be if I wasn\u2019t.", "5830 Next reason, internet is essential in enabling me to volunteer.", "5831 I believe in volunteering to make my community a better place to live. I volunteer at Michael Garron General Hospital, which was formerly Toronto East General Hospital. They like to correspond with me through emails to tell me about my shift work, give me updates, and tell me if they need extra help and so on.", "5832 The Ontario Disability Support Program encourages me to volunteer at the hospital because they feel it gets me prepared to join the workforce. And without the internet I would not be able to do and that\u2019s what my worker at ODSP wants me to do.", "5833 I also volunteer at ACORN. I am the co-chair of the East York chapter and really enjoy my time working there. Really, it is a community for me and without the internet at home I would not be connected with them. And that is truly very, very important to me.", "5834 I come from an emotional abusive marriage, which my son grew up in. After enduring a lot of pain we found the courage to escape the marriage. It left us emotionally scarred and socially isolated with very low self-esteem. It was very hard on both of us.", "5835 In the last few years by volunteering at the hospital and with ACORN this has changed and I feel that I do matter. Being able to give this testimony here today is proof of that.", "5836 My growth as a person would not have been possible without the internet access. Internet is not a want but internet access is a need.", "5837 That is why I choose to spend $50 a month on the internet. It\u2019s essential. But it does cut into my budget and it makes it harder for me to buy nutritious food.", "5838 Both me and my son have epilepsy and doctors tell us we need to have three nutritious meals in order for us not to have our seizures. ", "5839 With our fixed incomes this is hard and the cost of internet cuts directly into my food budget, which can put my (inaudible) risk.", "5840 The last thing I wanted to add is I participated in the ACORN survey. I helped get people in my community to help fill it out. But looking at the results of this survey I would have to say that my story is much too common here in Toronto and across Canada. Something needs to be done to make sure that the internet is affordable for low-income people like me. ", "5841 Thank you for your time.", "5842 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "5843 We will now hear the presentation of Rob Leiver.", "PRESENTATION ", "5844 MR. LEIVER: How are you? My name is Robert Leiver. Thanks for allowing me to talk here today.", "5845 Why don\u2019t I let you know why I think internet is essential for people? I\u2019m a single father as well; I\u2019ve raised my son his whole life. And from junior high on he\u2019s had teachers where he\u2019s had to hand his homework in online because it\u2019s emailed in. So if we didn\u2019t have access to the internet it wouldn\u2019t be possible.", "5846 He\u2019s now 20 years old and he\u2019s applied for York University. He had to do that online.", "5847 I am on ODSP myself, which is Disability. I had to apply for that online.", "5848 For us to get jobs, my son has gone to businesses to hand in a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and they\u2019ve been told, \u201cWe don\u2019t accept r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. You have to apply online\u201d which makes it -- it's essential to have online, so it's essential to have internet. You can't function any more. Our system is changing; the entire system is changing. Everything's online. ", "5849 Plus, if you want to find out where you are -- like, we moved to Toronto six years ago. I didn\u2019t know my way around. The only way I could figure that out was going online. ", "5850 I spend $110 a month on internet. I get $1,500 a month to live. My rent's $1,000 and I just -- and I look after my son who's 20, going to university. ", "5851 So it's -- if I want to get off of Disability, I either have to retrain myself, which means I'd have to go back to school, which means I'd have to have internet access for that or if I can find something that I can do as I broke -- I'm a journeyman carpenter. I broke my back, so I can't do my trade any more. My doctors told me I can never go back to my trade, so I have to get retrained or find something that I can do. To do either one of those, I need internet access. ", "5852 And when it takes so much money out of your daily living, it's tough. It's tough to eat, it's tough to do anything. You don\u2019t have no social life except the internet. That's how you get a hold of your family, that's how you find jobs, that's how you do your homework if you're young or you have children. That's the way it is. ", "5853 It's -- the cost is outrageous. Something's got to be done. It's just banking -- like, I would have to walk to the bank if I couldn't do online banking to pay my bills. I have a broken back. It's not really comfortable walking for a mile down the road to go and pay a bill that takes 10 seconds online. ", "5854 Anyway, that's all I got to say. Thanks. Thanks for your time. ", "5855 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for participating in the hearing and courageously sharing very personal stories. ", "5856 Vice-Chair Menzies will have some questions for you. ", "5857 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you, and thank you as well for making your presentations and coming here before us. ", "5858 I have a quick question for each of you, and if you want to go in the same order in answering it -- so I understand all your communications needs. Other than the internet, what other services do you have, like, a phone or, you know, a landline or a cell phone, cable, over the ear TV, radio? ", "5859 MS. ROCHON: Okay, what I have is, I have the internet.", "5860 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: Vous pouvez r\u00e9pondre ne fran\u00e7ais, madame, si vous vous sentez plus \u00e0 l\u2019aise. On a de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Inqui\u00e9tiez-vous pas.", "5861 Mme ROCHON: J'ai l\u2019internet et puis mon cellulaire. J\u2019ai pas le cable parce que j\u2019ai pas -- je trouve \u00e7a ridicule de payer -- j\u2019ai pas les moyens de payer \u00e7a l\u00e0. Je veux dire j\u2019ai juste l'internet sur mon laptop et puis mon cellulaire. C'est tout.", "5862 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. ", "5863 MR. CAMERON: I myself, I have a cell phone plan with Bell and that's about $40 a month, and I have internet access at home, of course. And my particular situation, my roommate has a landline as well.", "5864 MS. LALONDE: I myself have a bundle with Rogers. My son also has a bundle with Rogers and it's about $50, $60 a month. ", "5865 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. ", "5866 Ms. Ford?", "5867 MS. FORD: Well, I have a cell phone. It's just a little (inaudible) mobile phone and I have a landline. And I had cable. I just got laid off in February so I had all of that, but now I don\u2019t have cable because I can't afford nothing. I'm on EI now so that's what I have for now. But I think I'll be disconnecting the landline too soon because it's too expensive. I need the internet to look for jobs, so I'm going to keep that. ", "5868 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Mr. Diener?", "5869 THE CHAIRPERSON: Leiver.", "5870 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Mr. Leiver, go ahead. ", "5871 MR. LEIVER: Hi. I have one cell phone for both me and my son. I don\u2019t have a landline. I have -- like, my bundle is cable and internet together and it's $110 a month and no landline, one cell phone. ", "5872 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks. That helps me understand your internet bill a bit better.", "5873 Next question is, for each of you, I'm going to assume you have data caps of some kind, in terms of the amount of time you can spend on the internet in a month. ", "5874 I would like to know to what extent that's an issue for you and how you manage it when you have to manage it, how you would prioritize your usage of the internet in order to stay -- not get extra charges on your -- for your usage. ", "5875 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: Madame Rochon?", "5876 Mme ROCHON: Moi, comme c'est l\u00e0, j\u2019utilise l\u2019internet seulement pour \u00eatre connect\u00e9e avec ACORN. Je l\u2019utilise pas pour autre chose parce que je veux pas prendre de chance pour d\u00e9passer mon -- le co\u00fbt que \u00e7a me co\u00fbte chaque mois. Alors, je l\u2019utilise pas pour autre chose.", "5877 MR. CAMERON: In all honesty, I don\u2019t -- I have yet to reach the cap. The internet that I have access to, again, is shared and as to those specifics, I'm not aware, so it's not an issue for myself. ", "5878 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Ms. Ford?", "5879 MS. FORD: Yes, I have two sons at home so they're on internet 24/7 all the time. They go over and so I just regulate that end of the month and try -- I try not to be on it as much. But usually we go over it and I don't know how to do that. I don't know want to cancel my internet though, you know? ", "5880 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Go ahead, Toronto.", "5881 MS. LALONDE: I've gone over quite a few times and I do not appreciate that, and -- but like I said, I need the internet for literally all things that I'm doing, especially for my work with ACORN. ", "5882 MR. LEIVER: Robert Leiver. I too have gone over times to the point where -- well, I pay $110 a month and most of that's for the internet because I get unlimited internet access so I don\u2019t go over it because they'll double the bill on you or triple the bill. It's ridiculous. ", "5883 So that's -- I pay for unlimited access so that they don\u2019t do that to me. It hurts when they do it. It costs a lot of money. ", "5884 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. ", "5885 And I have one other issue because we need your help. And part of what we're trying to do here -- you may have -- if you've been following -- is we're trying to help understand what people's basic needs are and define that in terms of possibly designating the internet as a basic telecommunications service. ", "5886 So there's the basic, and so -- which we've been using all week as \"need\", and then there's want. ", "5887 So I read all of the submissions made on behalf of ACORN and I kind of, reasonably unscientifically, but I went through and made a little chart for myself of sort of the categories they fell into, and I took kind of three examples of each one. ", "5888 The first group was people who said they -- and on the first one I picked from Surrey, B.C. -- they were all from B.C., the ones I picked, as it turned out. It's from somebody who says they can't afford the internet and if they could, they could do job search and enjoy other services like search engines, games, and Facebook. ", "5889 It was obvious this person is challenged financially and job search is a need, but some people might categorize games and Facebook as wants and you know, because many people function in society without them.", "5890 The next one was somebody who says the price is too high and they can't afford it, but because they need it, they take money out of their recreation and other spending. They don\u2019t indicate they need to economize on food, as some of you have, which is obviously a basic need.", "5891 They indicate that if they could easily afford high-speed internet, they would be able to -- and this is different from anything you folks have said -- save money for other things. ", "5892 Some people might say that if that person was accessing an internet subsidy, money that could go to other people with different needs, perhaps more pressing, what they would be just doing is giving that person more money to save for other things that weren't necessarily basic, as your needs are.", "5893 And the third example is from someone who thinks costs are too high, but can\u2019t afford it. And they use the internet for email, socializing, researching, playing games, watching videos and pictures.", "5894 They indicate that they hope to see internet and Wi-Fi available in all part of the world with access everywhere and that it should be free. And some people might say this person has expressed very little need and a great deal of want.", "5895 So I need, we need, to sort of take that apart and understand what would be defined as need and what would be defined as want.", "5896 The first group, people who thought it was too expensive but could afford it without economizing, that was a little less than probably 20 percent of the submissions. The other one, people who were -- it was too expensive but they had to have it so they had to economize, that was probably a third of them. And then the other, almost half, were people who simply couldn\u2019t afford it but needed to have it. So there\u2019s obviously those three categories.", "5897 So I would like your advice on how I should or should not separate those.", "5898 MR. CAMERON: I\u2019m trying to process everything that you\u2019ve said. Like, a want and a need, like the previous presenter said, like to do a defined line of that is a pretty difficult task. Yeah, honestly I don\u2019t know how to answer that.", "5899 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t need to.", "5900 Mme ROCHON: J\u2019aimerais dire bien comme organisme ACORN nous autres on est l\u00e0 pour les gens qui sont vraiment d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s.", "5901 Les -- ce qu\u2019on a besoin et puis -- the wants and the need, les besoins sont plus important pour la plupart de nos membres que ce qu\u2019ils veulent. Alors les besoins sont vraiment drastiques.

", "5903 Pour ce qui est des -- ce qu\u2019ils veulent, je veux dire c\u2019est s\u00fbr que quand on ne peut pas -- j\u2019essaie d\u2019expliquer \u00e7a. ", "5904 Si on avait un programme pour avoir l\u2019internet abordable, c\u2019est s\u00fbr que les gens ils peuvent aller regarder des films et des choses comme \u00e7a. \u00c7a pas \u00e0 nous autres \u00e0 juger qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019ils vont faire.", "5905 Mais l\u2019important, le plus important, c\u2019est qu\u2019ils soient capables de se trouver des emplois, qu\u2019ils soient capables d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. De partir leur entreprise.", "5906 Puis comme si ils ont du temps d\u2019extra, bien ce qu\u2019ils font avec leur internet bon bien c\u2019est -- tout le monde a besoin de se divertir l\u00e0 en quelque part l\u00e0. ", "5907 Alors moi mes priorit\u00e9s c\u2019est ces choses-l\u00e0 que je regarde. C\u2019est qu\u2019est-ce que les gens ont besoin. Merci. ", "5908 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Merci.", "5909 MR. FORD: My opinion is that it is a need and it\u2019s all Canadian\u2019s needs. That\u2019s what mostly a lot of the youth need. If you want young people to go to school and go to university and get jobs and get educated and get off Welfare, it\u2019s a need. They need to be out working. With those computer skills they need to do university. And those people that suffer are the ones that are low and moderate-income people and kids from those families where people are struggling. And they really need it. It\u2019s a need; it\u2019s not a desire or something like that.", "5910 And even it\u2019s a need for all Canadians. It\u2019s a need for abused women and homeless people. Homeless people would not be homeless if they had access and they could find housing. Like, there\u2019s a whole broad social thing. That\u2019s where I work with.", "5911 And so you see all these people. Like, some people don\u2019t find housing. The only reason why they are homeless is because they don\u2019t have access to internet, right? They\u2019re really smart people but they\u2019re homeless people. And if they had that access, then their life circumstances would change. ", "5912 And I think that\u2019s just my opinion. It\u2019s a need for everybody if you want people in Canada to prosper.", "5913 It\u2019s a need for our First Nations people, Aboriginal people. I\u2019m from Labrador myself and those people up there don\u2019t even have a lot of internet. And we want people to be educated and get work?", "5914 So that\u2019s the way I look at it. Thank you.", "5915 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "5916 MS. LALONDE: I believe it\u2019s a need also.", "5917 As I said, my son and I both have epilepsy and we need to have nutritious food. And we also need to have transportation to get to my volunteer work and also to have internet to find work and to communicate with my friends because of the epilepsy again.", "5918 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "5919 MR. LEIVER: Robert Leiver. The implication is that Facebook is a want and not a need. I consider talking to my family a need not a want. I talk to them on Facebook. I don\u2019t play games on Facebook; I talk to my friends and family. And I need to do that. I don\u2019t want to do it; I need to do it.", "5920 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. ", "5921 Those are all my questions for you for this panel. Thank you again. You articulated yourselves very well and we\u2019re aware of the fact that it can be vaguely intimidating coming into these rooms. And I appreciate your presentations. Thank you very much. ", "5922 My colleagues may have some questions.", "5923 THE CHAIRPERSON: I have a question for you and it was based on my colleague\u2019s initial question about your various telecommunications services or communications services you have. And you know, each household is different and your needs are different in terms of home of you having different services.", "5924 And I\u2019ll be perfectly blunt, even in my case sometimes I don\u2019t know how much capacity gets absorbed by things. And we all struggle with this; it\u2019s relatively new as a phenomenon, right? It\u2019s not something that\u2019s been around since my birth. In fact, they often describe technology as something that arises after you get born. So for, I guess, my grandfather the car was technology; for my parents it was probably television; and for me it\u2019s the internet.", "5925 And it\u2019s not always clear how much things cost, how it gets consumed; are there ways to minimize the pressure on the household budget? In your case I appreciate that.", "5926 So I was wondering if you could help me. To whom do you turn to get some practical advice on how to manage your telecommunications services to get the right package that fits your needs and your budgets? And I take your point that there\u2019s not enough money to go around. But I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s the support? Does ACORN do that as an association for the members? Do the programs that you benefit from, the Social Assistance program, do they help you out in trying to manage? ", "5927 So I\u2019m seeing people nodding, \u201cNo.\u201d So do I take it that that\u2019s not a service that\u2019s available anywhere?", "5928 MR. CAMERON: Yeah, no, it\u2019s basically learn as you go and there\u2019s sometimes really hard lessons when you go over and you\u2019re completely unaware and then that bill comes it\u2019s like, \u201cBoom\u201d and it just hits you.", "5929 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And when you\u2019re tight that\u2019s even worse because --", "5930 MR. CAMERON: Yeah.", "5931 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah.", "5932 MR. CAMERON: Yeah. And it\u2019s no fun having to lean on family for assistance that way.", "5933 AUDIENCE MEMBER: You can also tell him that it\u2019s not included in the Ontario Works program. It\u2019s not considered a ---", "5934 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, okay. Sir, yes, you\u2019re not at the mic but I\u2019ll repeat what you said just so we have it on the record. And that was a question I was asking of other groups as to whether the cost of telecommunications or communications services is generally not part of the calculation of the amounts, the payments you get, social supportive, one way or the other, right? No. Okay. Good.", "5935 The folks from the previous group is going to give us some better sense of what\u2019s happening in each province and territory. So let\u2019s appreciate that.", "5936 Okay, thank you.", "5937 What we\u2019ll do now, I think the folks in Toronto -- well, did you want to add?", "5938 Sorry, you reached for it. Go ahead; we\u2019re listening. In Toronto.", "5939 MR. LEIVER: No, I was just -- you know, I think the biggest thing with internet and stuff is downloads, right? That's where a lot of the -- your gigabytes go and they -- usually they give you a gigabyte with your plan, which lasts -- never lasts a month. ", "5940 You know, you have to also realize that computers update themselves, and that's -- so the computer itself will download the information it needs. So then it's -- you really have no control of your -- you don\u2019t know and you never get warned that you're going to be going over your time. It just -- and you can't tell. You never know how big the download your computer's going to need to update itself so it can use whatever it needs to use. So it's kind of out of your control. You don\u2019t really know. ", "5941 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "5942 MR. LEIVER: And you know, and then the bills are predatory after that anyway, so --- ", "5943 THE CHAIRPERSON: I fully appreciate. I've been there as well, not being able to always assess how much capacity you're absorbing with any given application. So I appreciate that and -- well, if you -- no, it's actually better if you come at the table. Come on up. Can you -- oh, you have a mobility issue. Okay. We'll be patient. Come on up.

", "5947 THE CHAIRPERSON: Not at all. ", "5948 MS. ROWLAND: The question that you asked, I just had an experience with that this week so I wanted to use my unique experience that I had. ", "5949 Rogers does offer an email to you telling you when you're 75 percent -- when you\u2019ve used 75 percent of your bandwidth. ", "5950 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "5951 MS. ROWLAND: However, you have to have a certain type of relatively high level above the basic level of package in order to get that. ", "5952 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "5953 MS. ROWLAND: And the one that fit my needs, when I called, because my contract was ending. I called to find out if I could get a really cheap one that would meet my needs for -- I teach English online as a second language and they -- I ended up not getting a cheaper one but I got one by way of the chat customer service that they don\u2019t offer; they don\u2019t advertise it, nor do they even tell anyone about it in the general advertisements for their packages. ", "5954 So I was able to get one. It didn\u2019t end up being cheaper but it had a much -- more than double the bandwidth that I had been using for the last two years and occasionally having to just cut my everything off about the 20th of the month to make sure I didn\u2019t go over. I find out that they have something they're not even telling anybody about. But you can only find out about it by way of the internet. ", "5955 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "5956 MS. ROWLAND: So in regard to whether -- it's a struggle to afford it, but without it, you can't even find ways to make ends meet. ", "5957 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "5958 MS. ROWLAND: So it's kind of like a self-fulfilling or a cycle that you get trapped into and there's no getting out. It's very hard to -- especially when you're a disabled person -- to differentiate between a want and a need because we have mental health needs that people who are able-bodied and who have viable incomes can satisfy easily just in their normal ability to function in society with money and physical health.", "5959 So if I budget more than 50 percent of what's needed beyond my rent and utilities, what I have left over after rent and utilities are paid, and that the rest of that -- if I take what's really for food and 50 percent of it, $110 -- $120 and apply it to my internet and cable, I don\u2019t consider the want. I don\u2019t consider the luxury. You know, I consider the necessity because I would -- there are weeks when I don\u2019t even speak or hear another human voice except for my TV. ", "5960 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "5961 MS. ROWLAND: You know? ", "5962 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. ", "5963 MS. ROWLAND: And so forth and so on. So I just --- ", "5964 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you. ", "5965 MS. ROWLAND: --- wanted to share that with you.", "5966 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for that. By the way, just so we can identify you in the transcripts, could you identify yourself, Ma'am, your name please?", "5967 MS. ROWLAND: My name is Michelle Rowland. I'm a member of ACORN in south Ottawa. ", "5968 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.

It's my understanding that that means we'll cut you off in Toronto, so thank you very much for having participated so far in this.", "5970 Alors, Madame la secr\u00e9taire, si on peut -- if we could put the folks through. ", "5971 THE SECRETARY: Yes. We will connect to Vancouver and Dartmouth and we have someone on the phone in Calgary. ", "5972 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, Dartmouth, not Halifax. I always make that mistake. ", "5973 MR. AHPUMA: Hello?", "5974 THE SECRETARY: Hello. How are you? Welcome. ", "5975 We will now hear the presentation of five ACORN members. Two are appearing from the Vancouver CRTC office, two from the Dartmouth CRTC office, and one person is appearing by teleconference in Calgary.", "5976 We will hear all five presentations, which will then be followed by questions from the members. ", "5977 Please introduce yourselves before beginning, and you will each have five minutes for your presentation.", "5978 We will start with the presentation by Pascualle Ahpuma, appearing by teleconference. You may begin. Thank you.", "PRESENTATION ", "5979 MR. AHPUMA: Hi everyone. My names are Pascualle Ahpuma and I'm from Calgary and I'm an ACORN member but I will talk from my own point of experience as a person why internet is a need.", "5980 I need affordable internet because when I came in to Canada as a new immigrant, I had challenges and I still have challenges because all application forms are being done online, and being online, so that's an internet issue. And for that, (inaudible) a need to pay more money for you to stay connected. ", "5981 So anytime I go to CIC office, I'm given a website, then I'm told, \"Okay, go online, go on this website and then open up the application, fill them out online.\" ", "5982 And also EI, Employment Insurance is done online. As an immigrant, I need a job and all the jobs, you are given websites. You go to a job office where they tell you, \"Okay.\" ", "5983 They give you a list of all the companies who need jobs, contracts, and all that is done online. And if you don\u2019t have internet, really you can't survive. ", "5984 And currently, I have a part-time job but I don\u2019t have an internet. My roommate has an internet and I contribute to that, but I can't afford an internet on my own (inaudible). ", "5985 (Inaudible) being a new immigrant, people who come here, they come with a family. If you have a family you have a need to take care of your family. You need them to have a better life. That's why you sacrifice so much to come here (inaudible). ", "5986 But as a family, you need to stay in touch. If your kids go to school, then they need to learn how to go online. All the assignments are given -- they have to be done online. ", "5987 And (inaudible) another thing is privacy. You need to maintain the privacy of your family. When you go like, accessing (inaudible) at your public library, you are not actually private there, and you can't carry all your family to the library, and so it is limited. And sometimes you have to wait (inaudible) to get a computer. ", "5988 So that's why we are asking as members and (inaudible) that affordable internet is a need for all people, for all services require internet, even now and even forever. ", "5989 So as an ACORN member (inaudible) I will say that internet is a need and it should be affordable for all. That's why we are asking $10; it's quite a (inaudible) amount (inaudible) from other people who share who I have been talking to. Other countries have done so, so why can\u2019t we? And they have the optics cable (inaudible) and then we have the wireless. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re asking the companies in charge, \u201c(Inaudible) did you consider it to provide us that need.\u201d That way we can\u2019t keep in touch with our families.", "5990 For me personally back home, I have to call my people. I have to use the internet. And if I don\u2019t have the internet easily I can\u2019t be in touch with them and I can\u2019t be able to know how they are doing and they can\u2019t be able to know how I am. So internet is everything.", "5991 And we can\u2019t really ignore this because everything is going online. You need to buy a car? Go online. You need to sell a car? Take pictures and put it online. You need to access anything? Just go online. That means if you don\u2019t have internet you can\u2019t be able to do anything (inaudible). That\u2019s why we are asking that internet should be affordable for all people. (Inaudible).", "5992 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "5993 We will now here the presentation of Christine Holland-Downing in Dartmouth. You may begin.", "PRESENTATION ", "5994 MS. HOLLAND-DOWNING: Thank you.", "5995 Yes, I\u2019m Christine Holland-Downing. I\u2019m from Halifax, Nova Scotia. I\u2019m a mother of 8 and a grandmother of 13. I am a proud member of ACORN but today I\u2019m not here on behalf of ACORN. I\u2019m here on behalf of myself and my personal experience of not being able to afford internet on a limited income.", "5996 I\u2019ve worked just about all of my life while raising eight children. I recently lost my job and I had to apply for EI. And after my EI benefits ran out I had no other choice; I couldn\u2019t find a job by that time, and I had to go on Income Assistance.", "5997 I\u2019m still looking for work but I find it extremely difficult because I don\u2019t have access to internet or a phone. From Social Services I receive $553 a month. That\u2019s for rent, power, groceries, necessities. And I believe the internet here is around $85 a month depending on the provider. And let me tell you also, Social Services doesn\u2019t allow money for transportation to go out and look for a job here in Nova Scotia.", "5998 And this is a major problem for me and I\u2019m sure other people in my situation. And because I don\u2019t have resources to access the internet to access job searching to send out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and even to email potential employers -- I also can\u2019t afford a phone to receive potential interviews.", "5999 Also, I have a lot of family that live outside of Canada and outside of Nova Scotia. Without the internet access I\u2019m unable to keep in regular contact with my children, my grandchildren, and other family members.", "6000 Also, when my children had school assignments they would have to do their research at a library because even though I was working I still couldn\u2019t afford internet because I had children to feed, you know? So they had to go to the library and wait for a computer, because, you know, there\u2019s limited computers in a library, in order to do their homework sometimes for the next day.", "6001 I do know that public housing tenants in Toronto already have internet access and I believe it\u2019s $10 a month. And I believe the provider is Rogers. We don\u2019t have Rogers here in Nova Scotia.", "6002 So I believe that having affordable internet would improve my situation significantly and other people that are also in the same situation I\u2019m in.", "6003 So with that, I just thank you for listening to my personal story and if you have any questions I\u2019d like to answer them.", "6004 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "6005 We\u2019ll now here the presentation of Skylar Aaron-Richard.", "PRESENTATION ", "6006 MR. AARON-RICHARD: Hey, I\u2019m Skylar Aaron-Richard. I am a member of Nova Scotia ACORN and I\u2019m here to talk today about why I personally feel that internet is not so much a want but a need. And I think that that need and necessity differs for everybody. But to include one person should be to include all.", "6007 I feel I should start off by saying that I am person with both physical and mental issues. I have arthritis, which makes it really hard, if not impossible, some days for me to be able to walk. And even on my good days, walking more than a block at a time is a problem.", "6008 I\u2019m also very hard of hearing and I have several mental health conditions that limit my ability to have in-personal social interactions with other people on most days.", "6009 I should secondly state that I\u2019m on Social Assistance and that does not include the internet in my monthly supplement amounts. I\u2019m on Disability, Income Assistance for Nova Scotia and I receive $675, I believe at this point, a month and that has to include my rent, that is $410, and it has to include my power and my food. And I am on several special diets.", "6010 To be able to have the internet it makes me have to take money from that food and other places to be able to pay for it. If I didn\u2019t have a Visa, to be honest I probably wouldn\u2019t survive. But again, that\u2019s only borrowed money and I do owe it back, which causes problems on its own. But you know, I need the internet.", "6011 I need the internet to communicate because I can\u2019t fully hear on the phone. I need it to run ASL, because I don\u2019t have the money to pay for classes, and also to reach out to community. Without the internet I would not be able to find help, make appointments, order food, or just talking to people.", "6012 And besides even that, I need the internet to be able to have support systems to keep my mental health stable. And I can\u2019t have that if I can\u2019t look up resources or talk to people in the mental health community.", "6013 As humans we\u2019re very social creatures and require a certain level of stimuli to remain healthy. I know I do. Which makes me feel like I need to make a point of saying the internet for entertainment is also a need. And I know that there could be a lot of argument made against that.", "6014 But please hear me out. When people don\u2019t have the ability to get up and walk and go places or, you know, they\u2019re lacking the funds to just be able to go do this, or maybe they have a mental condition; maybe they\u2019re agoraphobic and they can\u2019t leave their house, they need some kind of external stimuli. They need something because being left alone with your own thoughts causes a lot of destructive things to happen. ", "6015 We need to be able to communicate with other people as well as just if we can\u2019t reach out to others, to even just be alone with other sound or something that moves that involves us in community. And we lack that if we can\u2019t have the internet to get it.", "6016 I should say that Income Assistance here in Nova Scotia allows, if you\u2019re on Disability, for a phone but only $35 a month. So I can\u2019t even get data on a phone because without data on my phone -- my phone bill right now is -- the cheapest I could find because I had to get a new phone because mine broke and I need certain programs on it -- is $51 a month and I don\u2019t have data. So even putting that\u2019s too much.", "6017 I would also like to state that free internet at places like the library is just not an option most days because one, I can\u2019t walk, and I don\u2019t get a bus pass and I don\u2019t have enough tickets for anything but appointments. But two, because places like that have limited amount of time that you can be there. So great. And you have no privacy. So you\u2019re going to deal with your public things out in the open with everybody? And for me that includes talking and I can\u2019t bring cameras into the library to have Skype conversations.", "6018 It requires a whole other level of something that you just get. You get deprived from life with these things.", "6019 Right now my internet is $85 a month and it\u2019s one of the cheapest for our two big providers. And I split this with a roommate, which puts it down to 42.50 for me alone a month. This is still too much.", "6020 We have a right to the things we need and we need affordable internet now.", "6021 Thank you.", "6022 THE SECRETARY: We will now here the presentation of Monica McGovern in Vancouver. ", "6023 Sorry. I think you just muted.", "6024 MS. McGOVERN: Am I all right now?", "6025 THE SECRETARY: Perfect. Yeah.", "PRESENTATION ", "6026 MS. McGOVERN: I'm Monica McGovern. Thank you for having us to present at your hearing. I am the ACORN Chair of Burnaby, B.C.", "6027 I'll tell you about myself. I am a mother of three with nine grandchildren and I am a parent to two of my grandchildren, aged 10 and 14.", "6028 I am on fixed income. I am a senior. It is a hardship to pay the $65 for high-speed internet that I have. I have had times where I haven't had internet and it was a big hardship on my children. When they go to the library, like you say you have to wait when you get the computer. You are only allowed to have one hour and you can't save anything from the computer. You can't -- you just have to quickly look through and try to do your homework.", "6029 Sometimes I didn't want to send my kids in the dark -- I have mobility issues -- to take a bus to go to the library and then to come back. It's not safe. So I got -- you know, I do have the internet now and my children are really happy because as soon as they come home they are on the internet. They do all their projects, all their research and they use it for entertainment as a side.", "6030 I have used it because I am in the home. I am involved with ACORN things and in researching things and communicating. I have to send emails to people when we have campaigns and things and I wouldn't be able to do that without the internet. And also it is broadening my horizons to be able to talk with people, with my family in other provinces.", "6031 So for our family it's a necessity and even though I am on a fixed income it is squeezing me. It is squeezing me to take away money I could use for leisure with the kids or for a better diet for the kids.", "6032 I'll tell you a little bit more. I worked for 10 years as a youth and childcare worker and I worked with very disadvantaged children showing mental health and emotional problems. Most felt like outsiders as they fell behind in their peers, particularly in education among other disadvantages.", "6033 I also worked for 30 years for several Single Mum Support Groups so I got to know my single mums and what their issues were.", "6034 At the same time I worked for 20 years as a family counsellor in a parenting program where I worked in the homes of the families. For each family I worked for six months to 12 months -- six to 12 months visiting five hours weekly with the family. The majority were low-income families referred to Social Services and Aboriginal Social Service offices of the Ministry of Children and Family.", "6035 But most -- these children a lot were acting out against their parents and their situation living in poverty. Some of them aspired to go into foster home where they would get more. They suffered poor self-esteem and they felt social separation from children in higher income brackets.", "6036 Most children did not do well educationally and most of them did not have the internet to access and faced the same problems with the library. Sometimes the parents couldn't even afford the bus pass for their children to go to the library. So they fall behind. Nowadays it's a necessity, particularly regarding children's emotional needs and educational and life skill needs.", "6037 Most children in middle to high-class income families have internet and even pre-schoolers are using iPads and laptops to learn and explore information. But even when they play games they are learning.", "6038 By school age they have easy access to do their homework. They are very familiar with the internet from very little age. So they have -- they have their internet at home. They can access any school project. You know they are confined to one hour somewhere, like you say, in public where you can't save the information.", "6039 They can explore information and they can save it for their projects. They score higher than their low-income counterparts in school and pursue post-secondary education in larger numbers. That's a proven fact.", "6040 The lack of educational success due to poverty and the lack -- and related to also the lack of high-speed income (sic) leads to repeated social and emotional issues and a big economic divide that equals low-income families -- to get better jobs because they haven't -- they don't have the higher education that their counterparts have.", "6041 So what happens is, and it\u2019s a known fact, there is a repeated effect, like a cycle of poverty where these children that grow up in those homes that don't have access to educational opportunities, they in turn recycle into poverty. They get low-paying jobs or they end up on income assistance and the cycle just continues.", "6042 And I believe this is -- and it's a fact. This is a big economic disadvantage to the federal government because these kids are going to -- the cost is in social issues and in the low-income issues.", "6043 And even in -- the new UNICEF report came out in equality in children. Canada rated -- I think it's 27 out of 35, 27 out of 35 in providing equal opportunities for children of poverty, children of low income. So we have to do something and I think that given the internet -- will help stop the divide between the income levels and help equalize the playing field and reduce social costs and economical costs to the government.", "6044 So that's my say.", "6045 THE SECRETARY: Thank you very much.", "6046 We will now hear the presentation of Linda Tetlock.", "PRESENTATION ", "6047 MS. TETLOCK: Hello. My name is Linda Tetlock. I live in New Westminster. I am a low-income senior ACORN member currently employed on-call in housekeeping caring position and I am a part-time building maintenance worker still struggling to meet my subsidies.", "6048 I am not able to buy any natural vitamin supplements to help with my chronic back and leg pain, stomach problems, also brain function that I really need to improve the deterioration in my learning and very poor memory that is increasing.", "6049 Having such a difficult time -- oh, excuse me.", "6050 MS. McGOVERN: Sorry. She has become very overwhelmed emotionally reviewing her personal history so hopefully she will -- give her a minute?", "6051 THE CHAIRPERSON: Oh, absolutely, take your time. Might want to have a drink of water there, and when you are ready. No rush.", "6052 --- (Short pause/Courte pause)", "6053 THE CHAIRPERSON: Ma'am, you really -- if you would rather not share your personal story that's fine. We don't want to force you to ---", "6054 MS. TETLOCK: I would like to read it. THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Well, then go ahead then. That's fine.", "6055 MS. TETLOCK: I'd like to, thank you.", "6056 Having such a difficult time learning, remembering new things brings me to tears so I require activities I can do at home to help me. This all hinders me greatly from performing the work duties and tasks that are required of me. Plus, everything is so expensive, even purchasing fruit and vegetables. That's a real treat for me when I get to have any, if there is a little entertainment money. Being a person of disability trying to help myself and I cannot afford to have internet services, which would be very beneficial to me. I\u2019m here today to impress upon you the importance of this basic necessity. ", "6057 The reasons I require internet are being able to keep in contact with, you know, family members and friends living at a long distance I don\u2019t see. ", "6058 Very important to me is being able to search for a part-time employment more easily. My only method now is dropping off r\u00e9sum\u00e9s by walking around, accessing bus and SkyTrain, also word of mouth, which is very time-consuming, tiring, and it really aggravates one\u2019s disability causing me much pain, which extends from my neck down my back, all down my legs that swell. And I can barely walk. This is very stressful to me, having just to get around to find employment. Plus, not all employers accept r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in person; you must go online to apply -- all this shortens my list for possible employment.", "6059 I have very limited job opportunities and resources such as housing information; knowing tenants rights; what qualifications are required; searching various areas of availability -- this is difficult as newspapers offer very little -- and any low-income housing, if any; also government services; accessing various medical information, new breakthroughs; government forms and different programs offered to assist me in helping my disability.", "6060 Therefore, low-income persons as myself should not be priced out of this basic needed service I truly need. And I thank you and I appreciate your attention.", "6061 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Well, thank you very much. As with the other panel, Vice-Chair Menzies will be asking you some questions.", "6062 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "6063 I\u2019ll start with a different one this time. Could you tell me -- and just a little bit of context. I\u2019m struck by the range of costs that people have told us about that they pay for internet. Dartmouth there, Skylar you told us of $80 a month. And I did a quick check on the internet here and saw that that was probably around Eastlink\u2019s price and Bell Aliant is 75, which I assume after taxes would be up by there. I took a look at TELUS in Vancouver and they have a price for around $30 for a 15-meg service.", "6064 So it seems to me that, unless there\u2019s something technological that I don\u2019t understand, that providers are capable of providing a range of prices that may or may not be accessible.", "6065 So could each of you in the same order, starting with you, Mr. Ahpuma -- who we\u2019ll try not to forget about because we can\u2019t see you -- tell us what you think a reasonable price is to pay for basic services on the internet.", "6066 MR. AHPUMA: I think for me personally a reasonable price would be $10 for me to be able to access all the services that I need. ", "6067 All people that have spoken in this before me have talked about how people are being affected. Like, I have a client who had to need to buy a bus pass and the cost to maintain the internet.", "6068 But for me personally, from a personal point of experience, $10 would be good enough at least for people to have high-speed affordable internet, for all people.", "6069 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. ", "6070 I think we\u2019re going to Ms. Holland-Downing in Dartmouth now?", "6071 MS. HOLLAND-DOWNING: Hello?", "6072 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Hello. What do you think would be a reasonable price to pay for internet?", "6073 MS. HOLLAND-DOWNING: From my own personal experience and what I live on right now, it would be maybe $10 -- $10, $15.", "6074 I don\u2019t have a phone at the present time, I don\u2019t have internet, and I don\u2019t have cable. I can\u2019t afford anything. The only thing I have is a radio to listen to to keep me up to date in what\u2019s going on in the world. Other than that I have nothing because I can\u2019t afford it.", "6075 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Understood.", "6076 MS. HOLLAND-DOWNING: And our prices here in Nova Scotia seem to be a lot larger or higher than places we\u2019ve been hearing from here.", "6077 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It does. Okay.", "6078 Mr. Aaron-Richard? You\u2019re paying 80-something now?", "6079 MR. AARON-RICHARD: Yeah, I pay $85 and I\u2019m will Bell Aliant.", "6080 I\u2019d probably say the same, around $10, $15 would be affordable for where I\u2019m at because even paying half of that, because my roommate pays half of that, at $42 is just too much money. I don\u2019t have it. Our bus passes here in Nova Scotia cost pretty much the same amount of money as our internet bill, maybe the difference of $5 to $10 and that\u2019s a little ridiculous. Either way we\u2019re screwed.", "6081 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks.", "6082 And the folks in Vancouver?", "6083 MS. McGOVERN: Ah, yes. I\u2019m kind of interested in the $30. I pay 65 to TELUS for, you know, high-speed internet. We had the low speed but it was really kind of aggravating to the kids. It was hard to get on; it would take a long time, you know, for something to load. ", "6084 So I pay $65 and I think in the case of low-income people $10 or free should be good because I know these companies are making billions of dollars and I think they can afford it. And I think it\u2019s an investment in our children, like I said before, to be able to succeed educationally, take themselves out of poverty.", "6085 So I think, you know, $10 or free in some cases because in B.C. some people think everybody low-income lives in subsidized housing. The majority of people do not live in subsidized housing. ", "6086 I know in Vancouver there\u2019s a 5,000-people list waiting to get into social housing and many more that don\u2019t even bother. So what happens is, we\u2019re in a high-rent area and similar to what the people in Nova Scotia get, a single person gets around 550 to live on and, say, a person with a child gets about 600. If you\u2019re on Disability you get 900 to live on.", "6087 But if you consider having to go and rent a place, you don\u2019t have any money left for internet or for even, like people said, the proper food, you know? So I think that lowering the cost of internet or making it free, going by a level of income, I think that\u2019s what we need. So that\u2019s my point.", "6088 Here you want to talk now?", "6089 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, that\u2019s fine.", "6090 I don\u2019t know if any of you were listening earlier in the day but I made a point, in asking somebody else, in regards to the fact that Social Service agencies are generally in the business of caring for people\u2019s basic needs. And I\u2019ve heard some from you folks about a school system that assigns children work on the internet and that sort of stuff. ", "6091 But I haven\u2019t heard anybody indicate that they\u2019ve ever had any assistance in gaining access to the internet from Social Services or any provision from any school system to assist children whose job it is for them to educate in getting access to this.", "6092 Have any of you had any experience with any of the people who have responsibility for caring for your basic needs and your children\u2019s basic education -- have any of you had any assistance from anyone in those sectors? ", "6093 UNKNOWN SPEAKER: No, sir. It\u2019s not (inaudible).", "6094 MS. McGOVERN: Probably not. I hadn\u2019t thought of it. ", "6095 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And have you ever ---", "6096 MS. McGOVERN: Myself, no.", "6097 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Have you asked? And what have you been told when you asked?", "6098 MS. McGOVERN: Well if there was something available I\u2019m sure they would mention it.", "6099 I\u2019m to the point with Social Services I just need a job. I just want to get out there, because if you ask them for anything it\u2019s like you\u2019re begging them for something.", "6100 If they don\u2019t give you things like a bus pass to help you to go out there and look for a job, they\u2019re not going to -- I mean if they don\u2019t allow you money for a phone for emergencies, you know, or just a basic phone need, they\u2019re not going to give you internet, because that\u2019s a luxury to them. ", "6101 A phone is a luxury here in Nova Scotia to our Social Services offices, but yes. So it would -- you could ask, but it\u2019s not going to happen. There\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to happen. ", "6102 If they won\u2019t assist me and other people in trying to help us find proper jobs to get out of the situation we\u2019re in, that -- I\u2019m sure, you know, I live better on E.I. then I\u2019m doing on Social Services, but yes I\u2019m pretty sure that won\u2019t happen, but I could ask, but I know the answer would be no. ", "6103 UNKNOWN SPEAKER: I don\u2019t have any kids ---", "6104 MS. HOLLAND-DOWNING: I\u2019d like to say ---", "6105 UNKNOWN: Oh sorry, go ahead.", "6106 MR. AARON: I don\u2019t have any kids, but I can say from somebody who\u2019s been -- who is going to go back to college and who has been in college previously that \u2013- and just graduated from -- even back in 2008 from school and it being a requirement, that everything be done online and we applied for classes and stuff online.", "6107 It was the recommendation of the school that I either come to the school and do it or go to the library and Social Assistance didn\u2019t deem it necessary that I should have to have the internet. ", "6108 That if that was a thing then it should fall on the schools; was essentially Social Assistance\u2019s view on that.", "6109 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. Go ahead Vancouver. ", "6110 MS. McGOVERN: Yes, I\u2019d just like to say that in -- because I work with many low income people and also people in my -- in our ACORN group, the way it works is the ministry decides that they give you your cheque all together, but they decide that this much is for support and this much is for shelter. ", "6111 And that -- say if the shelter -- if you\u2019re in B.C. and single they say it\u2019s 375 for shelter. Any -- another 125 or so for support.", "6112 A family is also in a very low income park and I\u2019ve worked with them where it\u2019s a hassle to get a phone. ", "6113 What they say is out of your shelter you should also pay your heat and your electricity. That\u2019s the only things they consider a necessity, but they don\u2019t give you a separate payment for that. ", "6114 It\u2019s included in that very low shelter amount and most people are paying over 50 percent for shelter and not even having enough money for food. ", "6115 And there\u2019s no -- they don\u2019t care about internet. They\u2019re not going to pay for internet separately and when it comes to the schools, they can\u2019t afford to do it. ", "6116 We have our local schools that are signing on that they believe that there should be a $10 low cost internet available for the students, but the school boards here are suffering. They\u2019re cutting things right and left and there\u2019s no money for internet.", "6117 So sorry, that\u2019s my input. Thank you, sir.", "6118 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. Some of you -- a question the Chairman asked the previous group. I\u2019m struck by the size of some of the bills you guys are faced with. ", "6119 I\u2019ve heard several mentions of cell phone bills that are -- that you\u2019re paying more than I am for mine and cable prices or internet prices that you\u2019re paying more than I am.", "6120 And I guess the question is, is there through ACORN or any other agency, is there any one place where you can go to get some advice on where to get the most affordable plans or how to manage some of these issues?", "6121 Like I mean I understand Ms. Holland-Downing you don\u2019t have anything so there\u2019s nothing to manage, but for those of you who do have something, are you aware of any place where you can go where there\u2019s some coaching available, or where there\u2019s some rates available or assistance through let\u2019s say non-government NGO Social Service agencies? Anything at all?", "6122 MR. AARON: Not here -- not here no. We haven\u2019t been made aware of it. As far as I know, at least, ACORN what we know here, we don\u2019t know any through that and haven\u2019t been --- ", "6123 I\u2019ve asked through Social Assistance if they could direct me in any particular direction that would make this easier for costs, because I think the prices are a little ridiculous for things like even a phone, but they didn\u2019t have any ideas of where to send either.", "6124 Whether or not they did or not and didn\u2019t care is I guess a little bit of a moot point, but ---", "6125 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: M\u2019hm.", "6126 MR. AARON: There\u2019s no, as far as I know, in Nova Scotia any real like small individual places offering some special kind of deal because we\u2019re -- have less money.

I only deal with individual Canadians, so it was very good for you to participate in this. ", "6132 And I know that -- well I think you\u2019re all very courageous. I know that some of you it was quite difficult because of mobility issues and other issues to participate in this but we appreciate your participation.", "6133 I only hope that there are other people listening, CEOs and decision makers in this country.

", "6521 Please introduce yourselves for the record and you have 10 minutes.", "PRESENTATION ", "6522 MR. LOUIE: Thank you, good afternoon. Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup. Good afternoon.", "6523 I'd like to begin by thanking the Commission for the invitation to discuss a historic opportunity to transform rural and Northern Canada.", "6524 I am joined today by my colleague, Ray Orb, the President of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities and the Chair of FCM's Rural Forum.", "6525 I myself am the President of the FCM, Raymond Louie. I am the Acting Mayor for the City of Vancouver.", "6526 I am joined today also by Daniel Rubinstein, Senior Manager of Policy and Research, and Marc LeBlanc, Policy Officer, who both together lead FCM's telecommunications policy work.", "6527 I will be sharing my time today with President Orb.", "6528 The Federation of Canadian Municipalities is the national voice for Canadian municipalities and our membership spans 2,000 members from all across Canada from every corner and we represent about 90 percent of Canada's population.", "6529 Our members include Canada's largest cities, small urban and rural communities, as well as 20 provincial and territorial municipal associations.", "6530 The FCM works on behalf of local governments to shape the national agenda, to help solve national challenges and empower communities of all sizes. That's why FCM has long advocated for increased federal involvement in developing the telecommunications infrastructure that is critical to the social, cultural and economic vibrancy of Canada's rural, northern and remote communities.", "6531 We have actively participated in previous federal consultations on telecommunications services, including rural broadband spectrum allocation and the development of Industry Canada's Connecting Canadians program.", "6532 FCM has also worked closely with the CRTC on the development of a model Municipal Access Agreement for accessing municipal rights-of-way and participated in the first phase of this landmark consultation. On behalf of our members, we actively engage Minister Bains and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada's senior leadership on these critical issues.", "6533 As the national voice for municipalities, the availability of affordable broadband services is one of our major concerns. Simply put, broadband internet access has become fundamental in modern life, and has the power to transform rural and Northern Canada.", "6534 Modern networks contribute to economic growth by improving productivity, providing new services,", "6535 supporting innovation and improving market access. They give Canadians the capacity to collaborate, to work, share and learn.", "6536 Unfortunately the broadband gap remains a reality in these communities. Too many Canadians are without broadband coverage, while others remain underserved by insufficient bandwidth and network capacity to meet user demands.", "6537 Under Canada's current approach to broadband policy, there is a significant lag in terms of bringing broadband speeds and technologies widely available in urban areas to rural and remote regions.", "6538 The CRTC's annual Communications Monitoring Report provides a clear picture of this lag. While 96 percent of Canadian households in large population centres have access to broadband at download speeds of 100 Mbps, only 25 percent of households in rural areas have access to broadband services at similar speeds.", "6539 Low connectivity rates like these are a significant barrier for those living in rural, remote and Northern communities in attaining the kind of economic opportunities that we take for granted in other parts of the country.", "6540 In Canada's North many communities simply cannot participate in Canada's digital economy due to a lack of service parity across these communities and high system vulnerability, highlighted by service outages, technical failures and lack of redundancy. FCM's research on this issue has revealed the true cost of low connectivity in these communities, everything from resident's outmigration to a difficulty in retaining and attracting employees.", "6541 Not only that. Canadians living in rural, remote and Northern communities do not have equal access to government e-services and adequate speeds while others, in some cases, have no broadband access at all.", "6542 Some parties have argued that the issue of adoption is an indication that some Canadians lack the technical expertise and interest to engage in the digital economy. In our view, however, this simply isn't the case. There is much greater likelihood that the lack of adoption on the part of Canadians is the result of high cost and low broadband speeds.", "6543 Based on this assessment of the connectivity challenges facing rural and Northern Canada, FCM's membership has come together to develop solutions to this critical issue.", "6544 And now I would like to turn it over to my colleague, Ray Orb, to tell you more about these solutions.", "6545 MR. ORB: Thank you, Raymond.", "6546 FCM believes that the Commission's current target speeds, a minimum of 5 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload, are no longer sufficient to meet the minimum needs of Canadians.", "6547 FCM believes that the CRTC should continually re-evaluate its broadband speed targets to reflect technological advancements, changes in user needs, traffic, and network capacity.", "6548 Second, FCM believes that the Commission has a critical role to play not only in terms of setting broadband speed targets, but also in ensuring that basic telecommunications services are available to all Canadians regardless of the size or level of remoteness of their community.", "6549 In our submission, we recommend that the Commission expand the Basic Service Objective, or BSO, to include universal access to affordable high-speed broadband internet at speeds that guarantee long-term, reliable connectivity. This stance has been reaffirmed by a number of FCM's peers during these proceedings.", "6550 Finally, the Commission should adopt a comprehensive and long-term funding mechanism for basic broadband access and the existing arrangement for basic telecommunications services is a good starting point. This mechanism could work alongside the current mix of targeted government programs and public/private partnerships.", "6551 We also suggest the Commission develop a specific strategy for Canada's North that sets out a sustained funding commitment for developing communications networks as well as a regulatory environment that fosters competition in this area.", "6552 It is important the Commission ensure that investment strategies for Arctic communication networks include provisions for rapid technological change and that every Arctic community has a redundant connection to prevent gaps in essential communication services.", "6553 This consultation provides an historic opportunity to establish a comprehensive, 1ong term plan for universal access to high-speed broadband. The Commission plays a critical role in ensuring basic telecommunications services, including broadband, are available to all Canadians, regardless of where in the country they reside. To realize this vision, we believe that all orders of government must work together in full partnership.", "6554 The Commission has a unique opportunity to turn this bold vision into meaningful action by laying the foundation for universal and high-speed broadband access for all Canadians.", "6555 On behalf of Canada's cities and communities, we thank the Commission for the opportunity to take part in this proceeding, as well as other parties' contributions and recommendations.", "6556 Thank you. Merci.", "6557 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you very much. We will put you in the hands of Commissioner MacDonald as a first step.", "6558 MR. LOUIE: Thank you.", "6559 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good afternoon and thank you, especially to those of you that have travelled from far and wide to be here today, especially on a Friday afternoon.", "6560 I want to understand just a little bit the survey that you presented in your original submission. As I understand, it was conducted at your annual conference in Edmonton, Alberta last year and I am just trying to understand the make-up of the room and the participants that actually filled out the survey.", "6561 You have over 2,000 member municipalities. Were they all in the room? Were some communities closer to the conference site in Alberta over-represented versus other communities that might have not been represented in other parts of the country?", "6562 Can you speak to how representative that group was of your wider membership?", "6563 MR. LOUIE: Well, it was a survey of just our rural and Northern remote communities, not including our urban centres first of all.", "6564 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah.", "6565 MR. LOUIE: The distribution of the membership at our annual conferences depended on their own self-selecting whether or not they would come to the conference. But certainly there is a significant overweighting towards these communities at our conference. Out of the 2,000 members, of course, the majority of them are rural communities.", "6566 Just broadly speaking, a third of Canada's population lives in rural and Northern remote communities. A third of our GDP is created as a result of this membership but the weighting of the membership that shows up at our annual general conference is much higher than that one-third. It's likely, I would say, closer to 60 percent of our membership that shows up at our annual conference.", "6567 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, perfect.", "6568 Thank you for that clarification. I'd just like to make sure I understand the set of lenses from which I'm viewing the numbers. ", "6569 So in Paragraph 15 of your intervention, you note that nine percent feel that the current target of five and one is sufficient, 23 percent prefer a higher target of 10 megs, and the majority of 53 selected 25 megs.", "6570 And I'm wondering if you can tell me how they arrived at those numbers? Were they check boxes on the survey? Was information provided as to what types of applications you can run at different bandwidths? ", "6571 MR. LOUIE: I'm just trying to flip to the survey itself. Maybe I'll just go to Daniel instead. ", "6572 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Sure. Hi Commissioner. We provided our delegates with the survey with several options that included the current level, the 10 megabit target, the 25 megabit target, and they were asked to speak from their experience in their community, both inside and outside while travelling.", "6573 You know, we do have different types of context coming in. Some of our members are from -- working from an agricultural point of view or from an educational point of view. Some are very involved in delivery of services, so it reflects the experience that they're bringing in as they're answering the question. ", "6574 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, and so the similar question, about half said that they felt that their service was inferior to their neighbours. So were they provided with a list of different bandwidths in different communities? Were they comparing themselves to their neighbours in rural and remote or northern communities? Were they comparing themselves to downtown Toronto? ", "6575 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Again, we asked delegates to think about their own community and where they live and think about their neighbours in that situation and how they felt their service compared, both from the speed perspective but also in the north in terms of latency, redundancy, and the other factors that we talked about in our submission.", "6576 THE CHAIRPERSON: Were any of your conversations that you had either informally or formally focused on the topic of data usage and data caps? ", "6577 And the reason I ask is, we've heard a lot in the hearing about people wanting, you know, faster speeds, you know, higher broadband targets. ", "6578 But others have suggested it really doesn\u2019t matter how big the pipe is; if you use up your data allowance in the first week of the month, you're at a bit of a loose end or facing significant charges for the rest of the month. ", "6579 So is that part of the conversation as well? ", "6580 MR. LOUIE: That's definitely part of the conversation. Great concerns in regards to the ability to access, especially in situations where we're talking about accessing for health care, for instance, and for whatever reason, the data cap is reached and then you don\u2019t have the capacity, without significant cost, to accessing, I think, what is -- should be fundamental in the ability of Canadians to have the access to information, especially in light of the move across all levels of government for accessing of services online.", "6581 And so it extends beyond health. It goes to other basic services that are being directed towards online types -- services across our nation.", "6582 THE CHAIRPERSON: Obviously, more and more municipalities are trying to encourage their residents to use online applications to do things like renew licences and so forth. ", "6583 Is that work pretty much done in the country? From a municipal standpoint, is most of what can be put online already accessible online, or do you think we're going to continue to see the needs of customers connecting to their municipalities continue to increase for online services?", "6584 MR. LOUIE: Well, I've -- the answer to that is no, the work's not done and I expect there to be a continual migration to find these types of efficiencies, in light of the fact that local government receives between 8 and 10 cents of every tax dollar, and our ability to generate additional revenues is limited, that we look continuously for efficiencies. ", "6585 Online technology is one of the ways that we go about providing the best value for money for our citizens and the residents. But without the capacity on the broadband bandwidth itself, it's hard for the local governments to even go down that path. ", "6586 There's many areas that are so slow of speed that the applications just will not run, that the amount of time that a person sitting in front of the computer waiting for the application to load makes it prohibitive, both in terms of time and the actual service is unable to be transacted as a result of the technological needs of that specific application. ", "6587 MR. ORB: Could I have the mic? ", "6588 Yeah, I'd like to just add to that. I think that there are more applications all the time that are required in, you know, across the country in the rural areas, and that in some cases, it may be that the residents have to travel. They don\u2019t have access, you know, to the high speed internet on their own, so they have to travel. So there is a cost to that as well. ", "6589 And so I think it does a couple of things that really inhibits people from setting up businesses in rural areas because of the fact that they don\u2019t have access to this. And it really is -- it puts you at a real disadvantage. I know it's something that we've heard, you know, travelling across the country, but this is something people would like to do. ", "6590 In some cases they're better off to locate their businesses in the rural areas because often that's where the resources are. And so it just makes common sense, but if they don\u2019t have access to this, it stops people from doing it.", "6591 And then the other thing is, you know, it can be -- it is a social issue too, because people will not move out necessarily out of the urban centres, especially the big cities. ", "6592 We as municipal councillors, we like to have residents come in because often our populations aren't high enough in some areas. We'd like to have more people living in our municipalities, and so -- yet especially younger families, you know, they don\u2019t want to do that. ", "6593 Another thing is as well, the applications that are used now, a lot of it in the ag sector -- the agriculture as well, they need to have access to high speed because they just can't run some of this machinery. Some of the agriculture equipment itself has to have good access to high speed. If it's delivered by satellite, that can be inconsistent and sometimes it actually stops the machines from operating because the satellite will go out of commission. And so everything stops on a farm if it doesn\u2019t pick up that signal. ", "6594 So they're all important issues to us.", "6595 THE CHAIRPERSON: And that was actually where I was going to go next because -- and some of the questions may be difficult to answer because you're representing more than 2,000 municipalities and what's an issue in one municipality may be very different from another. ", "6596 But generally speaking, have any of your members been able to provide any information, perhaps through their own local Chambers of Commerce with respect to what lost opportunities or what lost business opportunities they haven't been able to take advantage of due to connectivity in the region or what it's doing to home resale prices and financial issues of that nature that are of significant importance for the community and may be being hampered due to lack of adequate connectivity today? ", "6597 MR. LOUIE: Well, I think the issue that comes to mind is the ability for business to locate, first of all, into rural communities with the requisite sets of fundamental pieces of business instruments that they need to be successful to compete economically, not just locally but more widely, whether it's regional, provincially, or even internationally, especially when you're trying to compete against the international world where there is better connectivity than what we have as a baseline here in Canada, especially in our rural communities. ", "6598 When we have the issue of attraction or retention that I spoke about earlier in my opening, where you cannot retain your youth, where we have out-migration of our youth, 20 percent, I think between -- just let me pull out the figure here so I'm accurate -- between 2007 and 2012, we were losing more than 20 percent of our youth out of our rural communities. ", "6599 That negates an opportunity, I think, for people to grow within their communities and grow their businesses, but it's also near impossible to attract youth and others that have experienced higher abilities of bandwidth in urban centres to move them and have them, attract them into rural centres as well. ", "6600 It's not just specifically to the businesses, on a business perspective, but also in regards to those same workers off work hours and having the same quality of life, especially when you're perhaps communicating with family members that live across our country.", "6601 In urban centres, you can communicate around the world through FaceTime or whatever technology -- the app that you want to use. In rural communities, that's just not possible. ", "6602 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for that. ", "6603 Some of the presenters that presented over the last few days have also indicated that the reliability of the connection is a huge issue, suffering from latency issues, quality of service issues, mean time to repair when there is an outage. Has that been highlighted as a significant issue by your members, perhaps in some of the more rural and remote regions, or is their primary focus on speed and data usage.", "6604 MR. ORB: Reliability I think is a strong factor. And we\u2019ve heard that loud and clear from our members across the country that they have to have some kind of a backup system. As I mentioned earlier on, if you relied totally on satellite signals and that was lost, if there\u2019s no backup, in the case of a farming operation or in the case of a municipality or anybody operating a business, you would simply have to shut down.", "6605 And so I think that\u2019s a big factor. The speed is -- you know, I think you have to have something that\u2019s reliable beyond, you know, what we have now and I think that\u2019s the standard that we need to have at least across the country, some kind of a starting point.", "6606 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Yeah. Again, I mean, it\u2019s no different than in an urban area where, you know, you might subscribe to a certain speed and your level of service will fluctuate over time depending on the technology that you\u2019re working with. And that happens in rural areas as well. And especially in the north, the lack of redundancy is top of mind in rural areas with fixed wireless as you have more folks come on with a single site and before the next tower comes in, you know, you are going to have service impacts.", "6607 So we certainly hear that from different contexts depending on the level of service and speed that you\u2019re starting with. But the quality I think is just as much an issue as the speed itself.", "6608 MR. LOUIE: But just to add, it\u2019s important, I think, that whatever is decided in terms of changes to the regs, that it be responsive to the changing environment that we\u2019re working under as well, that the technological draw on a system will change very quickly. ", "6609 And so what we\u2019re advocating for is that the changes that are made are responsive to the conditions that will be coming. Your question earlier was, \u201cHave we satisfied the need or satisfied the migration of e-business online in terms of permitting and such even at a local government level?\u201d and the answer was, \u201cNo.\u201d ", "6610 And given that, that we need to be proactive in writing in place and setting in place a construct that can continue to serve, and not set just minimal levels but be thinking forward to when we need additional capacities, and the only way to do that and be competitive as a nation is to set in place a framework that makes this possible going forward.", "6611 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You\u2019ve mentioned satellite a couple of times and we\u2019ve heard a number of different proposals that basically run the entire spectrum saying that whatever the approach should be it should be technology-neutral, realizing what the costs would be to run fibre to Iqaluit, for example, and whether or not that would be practical, all the way up to other intervenors saying that even certain networks like cable are now legacy and everything should be all fibre all the time. ", "6612 And I\u2019m wondering, can you speak to that? Because you have mentioned your concerns about your reliability of satellites. If the service is reliable, do Canadians care the method by which they get the service or is it just the service and the quality they\u2019re concerned about, regardless of whether it\u2019s fixed wireless or satellite or fibre or cable or what have you?", "6613 MR. LOUIE: Well, I think the question appears to focus on a point in time. If the answer is that it\u2019s reliable consistently today and into the future, then the answer is no, there\u2019s no issue with that. But I think that if you\u2019re choosing a specific technology today and it\u2019s reliable but it may not be into the future, then that\u2019s not responsive to, I think, what Canadians need to continue to be competitive. ", "6614 And so we are concerned that by choosing one over another specific today, that it may not necessarily meet the needs going forward. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying at a conceptual level we should set minimum standards of service and ensure that it continues to be reviewed in a fashion where it\u2019s responsive to the environment of the day in terms of need.", "6615 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, thank you.", "6616 Just to change direction for a few minutes. We all know that the federal and provincial governments and territorial governments have invested significant dollars in building out broadband infrastructure to more Canadians. There was the Connecting Canadians initiative last year of over $300 million, and in the most recent federal budget more money has been invested. ", "6617 Can you speak to how much of that funding -- it doesn\u2019t need to be an exact number, obviously, but how much you feel has made its way into the rural and remote communities that you represent as part of your membership versus what\u2019s been spent on other projects and what difference that has made to date?", "6618 MR. ORB: I can only tell you, I guess, regionally what I know that has happened or is happening in Saskatchewan. And to my knowledge, that has been expanding or it\u2019s facilitated the expanding of our high-speed broadband into the rural areas. But those were only around the urban centres. ", "6619 And so those would be mostly towns that have received that kind of funding. And we work in Saskatchewan; we work with SaksTel, of course, you know? We hope to work together with them more in the future to perhaps expand the network of high-speed broadband.", "6620 But the problem is it doesn\u2019t actually get into the rural areas because it doesn\u2019t have the capability to reach out much more out of the towns, yeah, where the towers are themselves. So the rural areas, they rely on satellite transmissions. They are overloaded often because there is so much data being picked up that they are overloaded and they\u2019re just not reliable.", "6621 So maybe Raymond can speak to other parts of the country, but I\u2019m only familiar with Saskatchewan.", "6622 MR. LOUIE: Well, clearly there\u2019s, I think, a recognition that there\u2019s less than adequate service in parts of our country and hence the initial $305 million investment and now the subsequent 500 million by this new government.", "6623 What I would say is that the need continues to grow. The initial application or the allocation is still is, I think, about two years behind schedule of getting out into the field. And the world is evolving even now. And so when we\u2019re challenged by this evolving framework that we\u2019re working under, we need to move more quickly on this and looking for ways to provide the service that\u2019s necessary.", "6624 The rural communities are consistently speaking to us, as the organization that represents them, to put as much effort into this as possible. That\u2019s why I said it was a major concern of the FCMs and continues to be that when our rural communities, like I said, represent a third of Canada\u2019s population and a third of GDP and they\u2019re not competitive. I think that puts as at an economic disadvantage when competing with just south of the border with the United States.", "6625 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Obviously when you\u2019re running a municipality you have a long list of priorities and things that need to be funded. ", "6626 I know we\u2019ve seen situations in, I won\u2019t say the largest centres in the country but larger communities than many of the ones we\u2019re talking about today, where they have taken of their own resources and either partnered with local service providers or perhaps built out their own fibre-optic infrastructure to service their community.", "6627 Have any of those similar types of investments been made in some of your smaller communities?", "6628 MR. LOUIE: Well, speaking more broadly, I think that there\u2019s a willingness of some municipalities in some capacity, but more often than not there just isn\u2019t the capacity.", "6629 As I highlighted earlier, given the fact that 50 percent of your tax dollar goes to the federal government, 40 percent generally goes to provincial and territorial, and only between 8 and 10 cents goes to local government, our ability to invest into these types of projects is limited. You know, earlier there was comments of roads and bridges and other core infrastructure, which are also very important.", "6630 These things are what we focus on generally, but we know that it\u2019s not just these core infrastructures that are necessary to provide the quality of life for Canadians, that we need these types of services in order to maintain and compete and, in fact, excel in communities.", "6631 So our capacity to pay I think is limited, but there\u2019s a willingness to contribute but it comes, I think, at a local decision-making basis.", "6632 There will be instances where local communities will want to make that investment because they see it as the priority, and others that have perhaps higher priorities because of other needs they\u2019ll make those other types of investments. ", "6633 But I think at the basic level, an investment needs to be made at a national level for a core backbone so that when the decision is made at a local government level or provincial level, regional, to connect, that they can make that more limited scope of investment to connect to that backbone. If the backbone is not there, the cost of course is prohibitive because you need to traverse such a large geographical area. ", "6634 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So in your view, if we took an approach whereby our focus coming under this proceeding was to be focused on building that backbone between the unserved and underserved areas of the country; do you think that would be adequate to allow either new providers, existing providers, or municipalities to pick up the torch from there and then ensure the end last mile connectivity out to the constituents in their particular community?", "6635 MR. LOUIE: It would certainly be a good start. That is not of course the end of the equation. And I\u2019ll revisit the capacity to pay of local government.", "6636 But this will require a partnership of all orders of government, of the private sector, and the consumer to take up the pieces of financing that\u2019s necessary to build the complete system. What we\u2019re saying is that at a fundamental level there needs to be more investment at the backbone and that access is key for us to be competitive. Without even that initial piece you cannot stimulate and motivate and attract the investment that\u2019s necessary for that last kilometre with your investment.", "6637 Daniel?", "6638 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Just to add, I think it\u2019s important to remember that part of having a basic service, part of the barrier is last mile access and part of the barrier is that backbone. So whatever measures the Commission takes, having taken into account what the market can do itself, what the federal government can bring to bear with its resources, at the end of the day, if there are barriers from both sides that are impeding that minimum level, then the Commission would need to address that.", "6639 And there may be municipal partners in delivering some of those solutions within a funding framework. But again, waiting that lag over time is the challenge that comes to us at FCM. We hear from rural councillors, from mayors, from reeves about -- we know funding programs exist; we\u2019re still in a multi-year lag on what\u2019s available through the system that exists today to have telecom development in closer to urban centres.", "6640 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I\u2019ve never held office with municipalities so I honestly don\u2019t know the answer to this question. So take it in that light. But it comes down to a point where you touched on, you know, prioritization of different funds that may be available.", "6641 And I\u2019m wondering if some of your municipalities or if it\u2019s even a possibility for them to ask for broadband funding from one of these different pots of money? I mean, obviously there\u2019s infrastructure funding, be it at a provincial or federal level, that you can apply for for roads or sewer or water services, building a convention centre, new sports complex, what have you. ", "6642 Do such funds that exist out there allow you to apply for, you know, \u201cNo, we\u2019ll defer the convention centre for 10 years. We want to put our priority and put our ask towards building of broadband infrastructure.\u201d", "6643 MR. LOUIE: The landscape changes at the provincial and territorial level; I can\u2019t speak to exactly what the environment will be at that level. But I can say at the federal level there is access to a broad range of tools.", "6644 It does come down to what we believe is appropriate local choice on whether or not to have that convention centre deferred for 10 years, as you described, in favour of this type of investment. ", "6645 But it is important, I think, to maintain that individual local government choice to make those priorities because of course there\u2019s many other decisions that were made in tandem with that type of decision. Whether or not over the years that they\u2019ve invested appropriately for water and waste-water infrastructure, and thereby allocating funding, and there\u2019s no money left over in order to make this type of investment, they\u2019ve taken care of the basics, for instance. And for those that have done so, they should not be punished for doing the right thing over the years and in favour of those that perhaps have deferred that type of standard maintenance.", "6646 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "6647 Just changing over to affordability and the cost of service for a minute. I note in your survey that about a quarter of respondents said that cost was a barrier to them signing up for broadband service or if they had signed up they still felt it was too expensive. ", "6648 Did they outline what they feel an affordable rate would be and does that change based on the geography? Do more remote Canadians naturally expect to pay a little bit more than their urban counterparts? What did they feel a just rate was, at least for a basic connectivity service? And if you didn\u2019t ask the question, that\u2019s fine.", "6649 MR. LOUIE: Well, I don\u2019t think we did ask the question but I think there\u2019s the general recognition that our rural folks, our membership is reasonable in understanding that there\u2019s a higher cost associated and that an additional investment needs to be made on their part. On the ongoing service provision it would be, I think, important for us to understand that some parity is what would be desire for our membership and for Canadians across the country. ", "6650 Like I described earlier, it should be understood that in today\u2019s day and age with technology being fundamental to our quality of life on so many different aspects, whether it be education, business, you know, arts and entertainment, these types of things, and just pure functionality of your daily life, that this level of service should be equated to other basic services. And so access to it of course relates to how much money it will ultimately cost. ", "6651 A bit more might be acceptable with an understanding that it\u2019s less efficient, perhaps, but ultimately moving to a parity-type model is preferable. ", "6652 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Was there any discussion around if a build does need to take place -- it\u2019s obvious I think we can all agree it will have a significant price tag attached to it. Was there any discussion or do you have any thoughts around who should be responsible for paying for that? Is it the federal government? Is it additional charges being levied on service providers that they will in turn pass on to their customers? Do you have any thoughts on that topic?", "6653 MR. LOUIE: Well, it\u2019s in addition. We\u2019re advocating that this would be in addition to the basic service, that in fact there would be a levy. But it\u2019s not exclusive to just that stream of funding that would be made available. ", "6654 Federal government, provincial government, local government would all play a role as part of the overall funding strategy. The determination of what the cost will be will be indicated by the types of technologies, the scope and reach of the implement itself. ", "6655 And so we\u2019ll look quite carefully at each different application and depending on what is being asked for, what\u2019s being desired in that jurisdiction and decided ultimately through consultation with local government and provincial, federal, and the service provider, that will determine what sort of funding and mix I think will come into play.", "6656 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So just so I\u2019m clear on that, you would see each of the consumers across the country paying a little bit more to ensure that everyone had a quality access to broadband services? We had the Affordable Access Coalition in yesterday and they suggested for about, you know, $1.50 per month per subscriber would equate to about $400 million a year in additional funding to put towards a funding mechanism of some kind. Is that what you have in mind?", "6657 MR. LOUIE: What we say at the FCM is that we\u2019re in it together, that we are a nation that is attempting to improve the quality of life of everyone in Canada. Part of that equation is paying to ensure that everyone has access to succeed. And in this instance here, we\u2019re also saying that the inclusion as part of basic service is appropriate.", "6658 Daniel?", "6659 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Yeah. If I could just add, I mean, I know there\u2019s been in a conversation in questions to the Affordable Access Coalition yesterday about the role of the federal government. I think we\u2019re quite pleased to have a federal government that\u2019s investing. And certainly the market forces that exist and the federal government\u2019s investments need to be considered first as part of any decision on where there needs to be that application of a BSO through levies and then a subsidy out. ", "6660 You know, that does have to work together and I think we\u2019ve been very much involved in making sure that the federal government is involved as an active funding party. I\u2019m pleased with the commitments in the budget.", "6661 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah, go right ahead. ", "6662 MR. ORB: If I could just add onto that, I think we look at it, and you should look at it, in the rural areas as an investment. I think the country would look at it that way too. And I would hope that the federal government looks at it as an investment not only for what we need to catch up on, but perhaps into the future. ", "6663 So I think it will help in some ways to stimulate our economy a bit if it allows people to do people, you know, more efficiently and to progress. I think it\u2019s a public good when an investment is made in that magnitude. And we were very happy when we saw it in the budget. And of course we told the federal government that we were pleased with that announcement and all the other announcements that the government has made up until now.", "6664 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Perfect.", "6665 Just one final question and it\u2019s something we touched on earlier when we were talking about the migration of, well, be they municipal, provincial, or federal services, migrating those services online. ", "6666 Providing a printed copy of the directory listings is in the current basic service obligation. Given that we are moving so much into this online world, do you have any opinions on whether a printed phone book is still actually required, and how your municipalities may still use or advertise in the phone book to allow people to connect to your various municipal departments?", "6667 MR. LOUIE: We, of the SCM, I don\u2019t believe have taken any formal position. I don\u2019t think I'm prepared to speak on behalf of all of the membership. ", "6668 Daniel? ", "6669 MR. RUBINSTEIN: And more generally, not that specific question, but I think again, it goes to the quality of service that we can expect and rural residents can expect from Wireline right now. ", "6670 And that's one of the services that has been relied on, so as we transition, it's important to maintain that consistency and quality of service.", "6671 MR. LOUIE: But if it was to be eliminated, then there needs to be an equivalency of serviced that's provided and that the -- increasing the importance that broadband service be made available so they can access that same type of information in a likely refreshed and even better service model than what is currently being provided. But you can't just reduce that access to information. ", "6672 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, thank you. Oh, sorry, go ahead. ", "6673 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Just to give an example, at the federal level, we included in our supplementary request to some of your questions about an example from the Federal Department of Fisheries, which was moving towards a licensing system that was only available online. ", "6674 Well, we hear about this where the federal boys said \"local government\" and our members say, \"Well, we can't access this service.\" ", "6675 And they\u2019ve been told at the federal level to go to the nearest Service Canada office, which isn't in their neighbourhood. ", "6676 So this is that question of timing and the gap as services progress that often -- you know, it's a valid question about municipal services, but I'd say it's even bigger at the federal and provincial level, the speed at which that's moving and how our broadband system is either caught up or in a lag, and we've been in a lag to this point. ", "6677 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, thank you very much. Those are my questions. ", "6678 Vice-Chair Menzies.", "6679 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I just have a question for the politicians, because we don\u2019t get them a lot and I know, especially municipal politicians are probably as close as anyone to the concerns of everyday life. ", "6680 A couple of the submissions we've had this week could end up adding a couple of dollars a month to people's internet bills and because I've got both a rural representative here from Saskatchewan, I believe, and big city Vancouver, I'd like to hear from you both about, given other shifts in public policy in various places, do you think people are comfortable paying a little extra on their internet bills to manage some of these projects? ", "6681 UNKNOWN SPEAKER: And we have to answer in a way that says that will be manageable for you in the future. ", "6682 UNKNOWN SPEAKER: Yeah. ", "6683 MR. ORB: You know, it's a good question, first of all, but I think even though people fill out the surveys and they say, you know, that expense is a big part of, you know, doing business, it's a concern. ", "6684 But I think the reliability is very important and the consistency of the broadband itself is really important to people that live in the rural areas.", "6685 It's important to the municipalities as well, because we already do a lot of things online and if we don\u2019t have access to that, I know some of the rural municipal offices, we represent 296 rural municipalities. That's all the municipalities in Saskatchewan. ", "6686 And a good part of those offices are in the rural areas and they -- it's very slow, it's very tedious, it's -- sometimes administrators have to go somewhere else to do their day-to-day business. It might be going to an urban centre. So it puts them at a real disadvantage and it's a very costly expedition, I guess, or venture. ", "6687 And some of the things we're also trying to do, one -- there is a program that actually we're working on in Saskatchewan now, and it's going to be delivered through Saskatchewan Government Insurance, and it's called -- it's a primary permitting system. ", "6688 So what it will do is, it will allow the trucking industry to be able to apply online for permits so (inaudible) they can do their work often on the weekends or in the evenings when offices in Regina are closed. And so they can tap right into the website and they can get the information right online. They will have. like, actually, an interactive map and they'll be able to trace their route. ", "6689 So that would be something we're looking forward to in the very near future of actually happening in Saskatchewan.", "6690 And the other thing that we're trying to do is, we're trying -- and this is really a -- more of a safety thing, because it has to do with emergency services like ambulance and police and fire protection, and they're trying to identify all the rural yard sites sites where people are living so if there is a fire or an accident, those services have to get to those places. And because they use GPS it has to be a reliable system. ", "6691 And so those are --- ", "6692 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: If people got all that they'd be comfortable paying a couple more dollars a month for it? We're back to the original question. ", "6693 MR. ORB: Yeah, I -- you see, that's hard to answer on behalf of the rural population totally, but I think right now they would be happy because a lot of them don\u2019t have any high speed right now. So you see --- ", "6694 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. ", "6695 MR. ORB: --- they're going from really zero to something that's maybe a little bit more money, but I think they would be happy if they had it. ", "6696 MR. LOUIE: Vice-Chairman Menzies, thank you, first of all, for recognizing that local government is the closest to its people. ", "6697 And to answer your question more directly, I think the answer is yes. How you stated was, \"a little more money,\" and I think that's an appropriate descriptor. ", "6698 I think an incremental increase that allows better access, not just to the people that live in rural Canada, but access for the rest of Canada that frankly, moves around our country. When I go on vacation and I travel across the country and I'm moving through a rural area, it would be nice to be able to stay connected. And having the access wherever I go gives me the confidence that I can still be able to conduct business. ", "6699 When I was waiting for my opportunity here today to present to you, I downloaded -- must be a couple of gigs worth of data that I have to read on my plane ride back to Vancouver. And had I not had that opportunity, I'd be less efficient being able to do my job in Vancouver. ", "6700 And so this is the type of, I think, scenario where I think will play out for many across Canada when they are paying slightly more, but having better access and consistency of service. It makes us all, I think, a little more efficient and we're willing to pay for that.", "6701 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Safe travels. ", "6702 THE CHAIRPERSON: I hope you used our free Wi-Fi available in the hearing room. ", "6703 Commissioner Vennard first -- next. Thanks. ", "6704 COMMISIONER VENNARD: I have a couple of questions for you, and they have to do with numbers. ", "6705 Now, you\u2019ve -- you say that you have about 2,000 -- you represent about 2,000 municipalities and communities. I'm wondering, of those communities, roughly -- you might not know the answer to this, but hopefully you'll have some idea. How many, if any, of those are planning on community networks? Has anybody got anything in the planning stage? No? ", "6706 MR. LOUIE: No, we don\u2019t have that data for you, sorry. ", "6707 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, and I'm wondering, because if you were in Edmonton you certainly would have heard of the community of Olds in Alberta? ", "6708 And so we spent a lot of time looking at barriers and trying to identify things that are getting in the way. And another way to look at things, there's something that actually worked there. They made that model work for them. They've got a gig up and a gig down. So that's something too that -- was that ever discussed at any of your meetings or anything like that? Have you thought about that? ", "6709 MR. LEBLANC: Well, Olds is a great example of municipal leadership in terms of delivering broadband at high speeds to rural residents but ultimately it was a success because there was leadership from higher levels of government so they were able to tap into the Alberta SuperNet, transport infrastructure to be able to deliver those services. ", "6710 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. It was also a success just because of the nature of the community and the champions that they had in the community that wanted to move that forward, the point being that there is a model of success there that might work for other communities as well. ", "6711 The second question that I have is along the same lines. Of your 2,000 communities, how many of them are organizing into regional networks? ", "6712 We heard the EORN model the other day, the Eastern Ontario Regional Network model. Do you have any -- do you know anything about that? And here again, I'm just asking for your perceptions on that or your knowledge, if you have it. ", "6713 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Sure. There certainly are regions in the country that are organizing, like EORN. We're aware of other proposals in the works that again, they're all contingent on accessing funding and hearing -- my understanding of EORN's testimony as well, spoke about the fact that the speeds at which that network were rolled out at are ones that have evolved considerably since the rollout and they\u2019re now looking at, \u201cHow do we take that next step?\u201d", "6714 So you know, that\u2019s part of the reason that absolutely there will be cases where municipalities will be directly part of providing service in a given community or region. But at a national level we need to have that expanded BSO at whatever basic speed target the Commission would set. And perhaps either municipalities will be part of delivering that or taking a next step in providing more advanced service the way Olds has on top of that.", "6715 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. Roughly how many regional networks would you say are in the emergent stage within the 2,000 communities roughly that you represent?", "6716 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Again, it\u2019s not a conclusive number but I\u2019m really only aware of a few.", "6717 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: A few? Okay, thank you.", "6718 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "6719 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "6720 And there\u2019s so many questions I could ask but I\u2019m going to limit myself very much.", "6721 And the first is really, it\u2019s a follow-up to the question by Vice-Chair Menzies in asking whether or not you view that persons within your constituencies, within your municipalities would support a change or an increase to their bills to support this.", "6722 My question is a little more directed to the position you put forward in how you were able to vet through both your urban and rural municipalities that this was the position. So in stating that you want a subscriber-funded infrastructure fund put forward, what was the manner in which you vetted this through your urban municipalities to support the rural?", "6723 MR. LOUIE: So at the highest level, 2,000 member municipalities of the FCM, that equates to 20,000, or thereabouts, local government officials in our membership. Our membership board at the FCM is a 74-member board. ", "6724 We came to a unanimous position in our budget submission to the federal government and our election platform, which asked for investment into rural broadband. And it was a unanimous decision of our board.", "6725 Prior to coming to that unanimous decision of the board, we worked through a subcommittee framework where we have extensive conversations about RS and more specifically on the subject of rural broadband, which has been discussed over numerous successive board meetings over the years, expressing our desire for additional federal investments.", "6726 As part of those discussions there was also the recognition that there would be a share of costs associated with that that would spread through a range of funding partners, including additional costs at the subscriber level.", "6727 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "6728 MR. ORB: If I could add onto that, the rural forum itself is made up of many rural members, rural municipalities from across the country. But they\u2019re also made up of urban municipalities as well, some of the smaller cities, which is important.", "6729 And I think that FCM promotes, you know, the cities, the communities, the RMs all working together on these issues. And I think because it became a high priority of FCM, I think it really is kind of a success story when you can think about cities that already have in some cases high-speed broadband access promoting that, you know, to the rest of the country. ", "6730 Because I think they realize that\u2019s one of the strengths that FCM has, is we have people from all across the country and very diverse municipalities, you know, some from the north as well. And those people are remote and in some ways more related to the rural. But because we\u2019ve got cities and villages and towns in our organization I think it bodes well for FCM and I think for the country as well.", "6731 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "6732 And you have designated broadband as sort of a separate advocacy issue. But would you say normally that it would be considered part of infrastructure? Or do you always consider it separate and distinct?", "6733 MR. LOUIE: Well, because it\u2019s not directly within our jurisdiction, the majority of infrastructure is not held by local government. It\u2019s not one of our traditional areas that we focus on.", "6734 Recognizing that 60 percent of Canada\u2019s infrastructure is held or controlled by local government, this is not a historical, traditional area that we would control. But you know, given some of the conversations that we\u2019ve had, we understand that it\u2019s always about a partnership, that there\u2019s rights of way that need to be had. And part of that equation is local government.", "6735 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I mean, we know that there have been many rural and urban municipalities who have contributed investments towards expanding broadband at various levels and speeds and technologies and so on. And we also know that you do a lot of activity in infrastructure-building outside of broadband.", "6736 As an organization do you provide your members with any kind of best practices, P-3 best practices, or anything else?", "6737 MR. LOUIE: Absolutely. We have a number of different initiatives that underway in terms of asset management. We have our LAMP program, which is run through the Green Municipal Fund, which is a federally funded program which just recently received additional funding from the federal government. It\u2019s a half-a-billion-dollar fund that we have low-interest-rate loans and grants to local government that was vested to us from the federal government and more recently another 125 million.", "6738 The federal government of course has also allocated $50 million-worth of asset management moneys to us as part of this last budget, along with 75 additional million dollars for climate adaptation.", "6739 As part of that framework we inject moneys and invest moneys into local government. Part of that investment requires a benchmarking and reporting back on how those projects were implemented and learning experiences from those specific projects, which in turn are then shared through our membership to other local governments and made available more widely to anyone that wants to access them on our website at the GMF.", "6740 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, I\u2019m actually on your website. So if I was to look in here I would find your best practices?", "6741 MR. LOUIE: You should be able to find it. Specific to each of the projects, you should be able to find on there whether or not they met the original intention that was set out, how they performed. And then based on that you can determine whether or not that type of implement or technology that they\u2019ve invested in makes sense for you.", "6742 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, let me maybe restate. That might be a little different than what I was thinking of.", "6743 MR. LOUIE: Okay.", "6744 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I mean, there is a request for an additional fund and there\u2019s also been a lot of recognition, you know, by different parties that any ultimate plan that will fully extend broadband requires participation by the private sector and by various levels of government involvement, municipalities, provinces, whether it be the CRTC or federal government or both. ", "6745 But there\u2019s a partnership here to get to an outcome. And so that kind of partnership I just wondered, you know, would require some guiding principles. To be at its most effective, it requires effective principles in structure, in disciplines and so on.", "6746 Now, you\u2019ve participated in many P-3 types of projects through infrastructure and otherwise. I just wondered if you had somewhere, sort of, those guiding principles, policies, structures, disciplines?", "6747 MR. RUBINSTEIN: So certainly as president Louie was talking about we share best practices for infrastructure management generally. And that would include three different types of procurement. If you\u2019re asking if that in the telecom space in particular we\u2019ve provided support to members in dealing with municipal access issues has been an area of focus as well as in (inaudible). And we\u2019ve advocated both at the federal level and with the Commission on broadband access.", "6748 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "6749 MR. ORB: Perhaps if you ---", "6750 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, please.", "6751 MR. ORB: If you don\u2019t mind I\u2019d just maybe just like to add onto that. I don\u2019t know if what you\u2019re thinking of is specifically what\u2019s happening right now with different levels of government and municipalities working together. You know, for us, especially for me, this is a bit of a learning curve, to learn what other jurisdictions are doing in a model, you know, that happened at Olds. We looked at that and when I read about that it was news to me. ", "6752 And I think it\u2019s a good model to follow. I know they\u2019re doing some good things here in Ontario as well.", "6753 Our members of course would be educated on that the same way we are. And so I think if there\u2019s something that works across the country, you know, some basic kind of plan, I think that\u2019s the kind of message we\u2019ll get across to our members. And I think that will be helpful.", "6754 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes, thank you. And it looks like an organization such as yours is a great way of communicating those successful initiatives and, you know, what was the structure and discipline and how did that occur. Thank you.", "6755 MR. ORB: And if I just could add just a bit onto that, at our annual general meetings, we have workshops, we have some plenary sessions there and we bring people in, we bring experts beyond, you know, what we can deliver to our members, but those are the kind of things that we can talk about at those forums to bring experts in from across the country and bring perhaps, you know, the community of Olds most likely will be there. ", "6756 And perhaps in the future we can look at listening to them and educating our members that way. Nothing like learning first hand from the people that are doing it, you know. ", "6757 MR. LOUIE: Maybe just to describe the GMF process a little more to you on who\u2019s on that board. It\u2019s a 15-member board. Five members are local government members, five members are private sector, sector experts, five members are federal government representatives and they are director general of representatives. ", "6758 And so the screening of the projects goes to that GMF council for recommendations to the FCM board of directors or our executive for final approval. But even before that, there\u2019s a peer review process to determine from sector experts specific to the project that then in turn gives their comments for the council\u2019s consideration and whether or not to fund that type of project. ", "6759 And subsequent to that, then as I described, there\u2019s a reporting back on whether or not that specific project met target or not and how -- or exceeded target, in some instances, on things like water reduction, greenhouse gas emissions, and other targets that energy reduction, these are the types of things that they would be each focusing on because it\u2019s a green fund is what the intent of this is. ", "6760 The asset management pilot project that I spoke of also is still working its way through. And the intention of that is to provide best practices and show through examples of multiple sizes of local government how to go about -- go to invest in these types of projects. And this certainly is applicable to situation where we would be investing into broadband. ", "6761 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just one final question, Mr. Orb, and it relates less to your functions as -- at the forum and more as your knowledge of Saskatchewan. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had a chance to look at our broadband map that we put online a few days ago, but just from looking at it, there\u2019s a striking difference between the situation in rural Alberta and rural Saskatchewan. ", "6762 And I was wondering from your perspective if you could explain that difference and I\u2019m going to speculate it may obviously be linked almost directly to the SuperNet. Would you agree with that? ", "6763 MR. ORB: I haven\u2019t seen the map as such, but I know -- I have been informed of what happens -- what has happened in Alberta, you know, there is a particular -- one company that\u2019s been delivering high-speed Internet in Saskatchewan. It is -- SaskTel is more responsible for that, although there are satellite companies that are doing the same. ", "6764 And so we\u2019re interested to know what Saskatchewan will be doing. And we have scheduled a meeting very near -- in the very near future to talk to SaskTel about that to be able to -- hopefully to be able to work together with them. ", "6765 Because, you know, in a lot of ways, you know, we\u2019re similar to Alberta, especially rural. We have like a large oil and gas industry. We have lots of ranch land. We have some places where there is no coverage now. There\u2019s no cellphone coverage either, especially on the southern part of the province. And so we see some similarities there. ", "6766 And I guess, quite frankly, it\u2019s a bit of a concern for us that we don\u2019t have the good coverage there. So I think we want to be -- we wanted to learn quickly how we can improve that in Saskatchewan. ", "6767 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "6768 MR. RUBINSTEIN: And, excuse me, sorry. ", "6769 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. ", "6770 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Just building on that too. I think service differences, when you look at across the country for example between Saskatchewan and Alberta, I think it\u2019s an excellent example of why we as FCM are looking to the federal government now for leadership in terms of addressing some of those gaps in broadband coverage. ", "6771 And ultimately it\u2019s not a matter of just investing in last mile solutions like the connecting Canadians program has done a great example of, but also in that advanced transportation infrastructure that will help deliver evolving telecommunications services. ", "6772 MR. LOUIE: Mr. Chairman, just to let you know, your map doesn\u2019t load on my iPad. ", "6773 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well prob -- that\u2019s not unusual. I appreciate that feedback. ", "6774 The other similarity, of course, between Saskatchewan and Alberta is that everybody seems to wear green at football games as well, at CFL games even in Alberta. But that\u2019s -- all right. Well, thank you very much for having traveled here and participating in our hearings. There\u2019s other stages. ", "6775 Now, we have a video conference for one last intervenor, so we\u2019ll take a short break for about 10 minutes. We\u2019ll reconvene at 3:15. Thank you. ", "--- Upon recessing at 3:06 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming 3:18 p.m.", "6776 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: \u00c0 l\u2019ordre s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet. Madame la secr\u00e9taire. ", "6777 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. We will now hear the presentation of Manitoba Keewa -- okay, sorry -- Keewatinowi Okimakinak Inc. with appearing by videoconference from the Winnipeg CRTC office, please introduce yourself and your colleague and you have 15 minutes. Thank you. ", "PRESENTATION", "6778 MS. FENSKE: Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission. My name is Allison Fenske and I\u2019m legal counsel to Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakinak Inc., or MKO, in these proceedings. ", "6779 I\u2019m joined by Ms. Catherine Dolay (ph), who is a student at law with the Public Interest Law Centre. ", "6780 Can you hear me okay? Is everything ---", "6781 THE CHAIRPERSON: We hear and see you just fine and please go ahead. ", "6782 MS. FENSKE: Perfect. Thank you. ", "6783 On behalf of MKO, which represents 30 northern Manitoba First Nations and over 65,000 First Nations citizens, I would like to thank the Commission for the opportunity to provide brief comments here today. ", "6784 I\u2019m also thankful to be able to join you remotely from Treaty 1 territory. MKO works to support and promote the interests of First Nations by achieving autonomy and self-sufficiency with respect to all areas that affect the lives of northern First Nations citizens. ", "6785 In terms of telecommunications, this translates to a desire to see the unique barriers faced by remote First Nations addressed. These barriers include extremely high cost to serve, higher volume of traffic per connection, and acute challenges associated with the subscriber-based systems, among other issues. ", "6786 MKO is particularly concerned with how the CRTC can assist in ensuring that the unique barriers faced by First Nations are addressed in a way that ensures the full participation of First Nations citizens in an increasingly digital economy. ", "6787 MKO First Nations have had to deal with substandard plain old telephone services, POTS, and wireless services for years. POTS can become overloaded, preventing telephone calls from coming in or out of the community. This has a real impact on MKO citizens. ", "6788 For example, it can mean that MKO citizens are not able to call the RCMP or reach a nursing station or Telehealth in an emergency. Outdated communications infrastructure is often vulnerable to severe weather, which in term can make responding to service calls difficult. This is particularly so when service providers do not have any local representation. ", "6789 In some communities, the infrastructure for wireless service does not exist and cellular services are simply not available. ", "6790 Rather than being cut off entirely from communications, both inside and outside the community, individuals turned to the Internet in an attempt to circumvent the substantial deficiencies of other kinds of telecommunications services. ", "6791 The opportunities available through broadband Internet services are significantly more far reaching than what POTS offers. Many interveners, including MKO, have pointed to the potential for better access to broadband Internet to not only improve access to health, education and social services, but to also increase economic opportunities. ", "6792 Over the three decades since the Internet was first developed in 1983, it has evolved from being a research tool used by a few sophisticated researchers to an essential tool for interacting with business, government, friends and family. ", "6793 Quality, affordable broadband internet is now a basic requirement for full participation in the digital economy. In the future, it will become even more critical as alternatives become less accessible.", "6794 The CRTC\u2019s basic service objective must reflect the essential nature of broadband internet services and the needs of all consumers.", "6795 The experiences of those living in MKO First Nations shows that market forces and current government funding initiatives have failed First Nations in northern communities. These initiatives have not been enough to ensure that high quality, reliable, and affordable broadband internet is accessible to many of the northern First Nations in Manitoba. In fact, they have not been sufficient to achieve minimum service standards.", "6796 As you will have seen in MKO\u2019s Further Intervention, MKO recently undertook a community survey to highlight the experiences of northern First Nation governments and their citizens. The results of these surveys tell us a lot, not only about the needs of communities, but also about the responsiveness of the market to date.", "6797 Community leaders spoke of some providers relegating their communities to a very low priority, and citizens facing unreliable or awful service. The surveys found that some individuals were waiting three months for a simple installation, or dealing with service outages for six weeks at a time. That\u2019s not six hours or six days, but six weeks. And during this kind of six-week delay, First Nation governments and businesses had to return to manual processes and employees were not able to take the holidays that they were otherwise entitled to. People would have been prevented from working online and otherwise communicating with loved ones.", "6798 The magnitude of these challenges is unheard of and would not be acceptable to people living in urban centres or even some southern rural areas.", "6799 When MKO citizens do have access to the internet, it\u2019s overwhelmingly slow, unreliable, and overburdened. Because of the remote nature of many of these communities, MKO citizens feel cut off from the rest of the world. The inaccessible internet services further isolates MKO citizens.", "6800 Our community survey findings are consistent with the EKOS 2016 survey commissioned for the CRTC, which identified some of the limitations and barriers faced by residents of rural and remote areas as a result of unreliable and inferior internet service.", "6801 In some findings at page 71, EKOS reports:", "6802 \u201cAs such, rural Canadians see themselves as being at a considerable disadvantage by remaining in a rural area. Without reliable and adequate access to the Internet, rural residents express feelings of vulnerability due to lack of access to health and essential services, education, economic participation, knowledge of current events, and social needs to mitigate isolation.\u201d", "6803 There are real and significant disadvantages faced by Canadians who do not have reliable and adequate access to the internet.", "6804 These kinds of disadvantages are compounded for MKO First Nations by the realistics and realities of many remote and isolated First Nation communities. Increasing social isolation and economic exclusion has profound effects in communities that are already experiencing high rates of poverty, unemployment, and high indicators for poor health.", "6805 We can see the consequences of persistent social and economic exclusion and isolation in the most recent suicide epidemics faced by a number of First Nations, including MKO First Nations.", "6806 Let\u2019s consider for a moment the kind of frustrations residents of an urban centre may encounter with their internet services. As one example, residents of an urban centre might find themselves cut off from or dealing with limited internet access if they went on a camping trip. For some, a camping trip might be an opportunity to unplug given how intertwined our daily lives are with the internet these days.", "6807 In some cases, when work needs to be done during a camping trip, the signal at the camp site might be weak and a search for higher ground and a few more bars is required. If you can\u2019t find a stronger signal, it may be impossible to send emails or conduct work accordingly. For residents of an urban centre, this experience is an exercise in frustration. However, when these residents return home, they are able to catch up on work and their life goes on. If they choose to, they can return camping to unplug again at a later time.", "6808 For many First Nation communities these frustrations are not temporary, or sought after for a break from it all. They can be unanticipated and a real drain on one\u2019s ability to go about very important daily tasks, work, schooling, banking, shopping, accessing health or other government services. They are not an exercise in choice.", "6809 MKO citizens find creative ways to adjust to the limitations of unreliable connectivity in their First Nations as best they can. For example, gathering at community hotspots or access pools because they don\u2019t have an internet connection at home, waking up in the middle of the night to use the internet when there is less community traffic, or otherwise planning their day around their best chance at a reliable connection is a kind of hedging that is a regular occurrence for many MKO citizens. These activities would be intolerable to the camper in our earlier example upon returning to the city, but they are necessary in northern First Nations.", "6810 And with that even adequate internet access, inadequate internet has become a necessity.", "6811 Notwithstanding the difficulties in internet access and service level and quality, many MKO citizens are passing over traditional telecommunications services like POTS in favour of adapting to the use of the internet to meet basic technological needs.", "6812 Given the particular social isolation in northern First Nation communities, it must be noted that 100 percent of our survey respondents use the internet to connect with friends and family. This must be understood within the context of the unique socio-economic conditions and family ties within First Nation communities. There is a high level of movement between First Nations and urban centres which is necessary given the lack of essential services in northern First Nations.", "6813 There can and should not be any hierarchy of internet uses. One might be tempted to view the use of social media as entertainment or as a want versus a need. However, for isolated communities where family members are often separated by great distance in pursuit of better educational, employment, and health opportunities, social media is a crucial tool for maintaining necessary and positive family connections.", "6814 In addition to maintaining specific family ties, almost half of our survey respondents use the internet to learn about their culture. Another quarter uses it to learn an Aboriginal language.", "6815 We cannot forget the recent Calls to Action in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s final report, which spoke of the federal government\u2019s responsibility to revitalize and preserve Aboriginal languages given the colonial legacy in Canada. The effect of colonization is not a relic of the past. Instead, these effects continue and are borne out each day in First Nations.", "6816 It is important to recognize that while the internet has led to the creation of a digital economy, the internet is also a powerful tool of cultural survival for First Nations. It has the potential to provide a cost-effective means of connecting family and community, and transmitting culture. The impact of access to quality affordable broadband internet services cannot be underestimated.", "6817 The role of the CRTC in promoting reliable broadband internet as part of its basic service objective must include setting minimum service standards and regulating rates to ensure affordability.", "6818 Minimum standards should focus on bandwidth and be reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect the service levels in competitive Canadian urban markets. A focus on bandwidth has the ability to recognize rapidly evolving technologies and shifting values attached to particular activities.", "6819 Where minimum standards are concerned, a necessary starting point is in closing the infrastructure gap experienced in many First Nations so that any minimum standards set are actually meaningful.", "6820 MKO supports in principle the Affordable Access Coalition\u2019s proposal for a Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism. For MKO, a necessary component of any BDFM is supporting opportunities for development and growth of First Nations and Aboriginal businesses. This can be done through the implementation of a Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Businesses or a PSAB-like policy.", "6821 MKO also believes it is important to recognize the incumbent internet service providers who were the first service providers in many underserved or unserved communities.", "6822 Many MKO First Nations in northern Manitoba are being served by First Nation-controlled internet service providers where many larger telecommunications companies have feared to tread. First Nations should be able to determine whether their incumbent ISPs have been effective and whether they could be accounted for in any auction process related to a BDFM.", "6823 An integral part of having meaningful minimum standards is the effective monitoring and enforcement of service standards. This includes transparent reporting to consumers and First Nations and a formal complaint process through the CRTC where a fund administrator cannot address ongoing or constant quality-of-service issues.", "6824 With broadband deployment effectively prioritized and measures taken to ensure First Nations have the appropriate infrastructure to support any minimum service standards, MKO supports an affordability funding mechanism, like the AFM proposed by AAC.", "6825 Any AFM should account for subscriber system realities of First Nation communities and be made available on the eligibility of households for whom services are provided where, as is common in MKO First Nations, a particular First Nation may have taken on the role of responsible subscriber to ensure internet services are available to the whole community.", "6826 A focus on broadband deployment, monitoring and enforcement of service standards, and increasing the affordability of telecommunications services, including broadband internet, is important and necessary for the objectives of the Telecommunications Act to be met.", "6827 In doing so, there is a potential to have a real impact in the daily lives of northern First Nations. They should not continue to be treated as second-class citizens when it comes to quality, reliable, and affordable access to telecommunications services, including broadband internet services.", "6828 The internet is the new centre for MKO First Nations. Any regulatory action must consider the unique circumstances of MKO and other northern First Nations. The time to include broadband internet services in the basic service objective is now.", "6829 Thank you for the opportunity to present to you today. Subject to any questions, that concludes our submissions on behalf of MKO.", "6830 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your presentation.", "6831 Vice-Chair Menzies will have some questions for you.", "6832 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "6833 You did a very good job on putting this proposal together; it\u2019s quite thorough and multifaceted. I have a few questions to begin with about the BDFM, with the license to serve proposal.", "6834 First of all, what do you think would be the appropriate criteria for designation as an underserved area?", "6835 MS. FENSKE: If I could just have one moment, Commissioner Menzies?", "6836 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sure.", "6837 MS. FENSKE: I think that hopefully you\u2019ll find some assistance in paragraph 161 in our February 1 further intervention where we do discuss some of the eligibility requirements for First Nations in particular with respect to the BDFM.", "6838 MKO\u2019s position would be that the BDFM should be made available to all First Nations that will not meet the minimum standards of a basic service objective for broadband that would be established by the CRTC. ", "6839 So in hoping that the CRTC would set a standard and include broadband in a basic service objective, whatever communities are not currently meeting that objective would be considered to be underserved and that that would be the broad eligibility requirements in terms of access to any broadband deployment funding mechanism.", "6840 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. And would it be available to non-First Nations communities as well?", "6841 MS. FENSKE: I would expect and certainly AAC\u2019s proposal contemplates that. My reference to First Nations is simply because we\u2019re here representing our client, who is a coalition of northern First Nation communities. And so that\u2019s the perspective that we\u2019re speaking from. But certainly we wouldn\u2019t expect that it would necessarily be restricted to First Nation communities.", "6842 Although I will say that in many instances while there are certainly underserved and unserved non-First Nation communities, the effects of being underserved or unserved on a First Nation who is already facing multiple disadvantages at other infrastructure social indicator levels, those effects are far more pronounced in many First Nation communities.", "6843 And so if there was a limit in terms of the capacity for the BDFM to apply to underserved, we would expect and would suggest that prioritization be given to northern and First Nation communities or the remote and isolated First Nation communities where the importance of having access to the internet is all the more important given the fact that they don\u2019t have the same access to services within the community itself. ", "6844 So you know, you don\u2019t have a bricks-and-mortar financial institution or you may not have a hospital. You may not have a local RCMP detachment. Government services and branches may be located outside of the community itself. So recognizing that tie through the internet, is that much more important. And so we\u2019d hope that in prioritizing that that would be taken into account.", "6845 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "6846 What sort of guidance would you give us when it comes to areas where there are unresolved land claims, and just in terms of being able to designate what is and what isn\u2019t a First Nations community? Do you understand?", "6847 MS. FENSKE: No, I\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m understanding the connection.", "6848 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The difference between treaty areas and non-treaty areas where there may be outstanding land claims, unresolved?", "6849 MS. FENSKE: Sorry, is that question linked to what I\u2019ve suggested, that the priorities be given to northern and First Nation communities?", "6850 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, it is.", "6851 MS. FENSKE: Okay.", "6852 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The answer can be, \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d You can undertake ---", "6853 MS. FENSKE: Yeah, I think that on that particular question yeah, I would have to make an undertaking to inquire with our client as to if there would be any distinction drawn between treaty and non-treaty communities, the way that you\u2019ve phrased that.", "6854 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sure.", "6855 MS. FENSKE: If that\u2019s acceptable to you.", "6856 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s very good. May 5th I believe is our date for those undertakings, okay?", "6857 ", "UNDERTAKING", "6858 MS. FENSKE: Yes.", "6859 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The other question, and I may have missed it, but what length of license term do you generally envision for the successful licensees under the BDFM?", "6860 MS. FENSKE: Sorry, I\u2019m just consulting with a colleague.", "6861 We would be supporting the submissions of AAC in that respect and their particular licensing terms around that.", "6862 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Can you remind me what that was?", "6863 MS. FENSKE: If I can be reminded of what that was I could certainly remind you.", "6864 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Well, that\u2019s fine. I just didn\u2019t recall them having a specific one but I read your file most recently.", "6865 MS. FENSKE: Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you.", "6866 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: While she\u2019s looking that up I\u2019ll get onto the next question, if that\u2019s okay? And we can come back to that? Okay.", "6867 MS. FENSKE: Yes.", "6868 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And the next question is, would these licensees be expected to provided competitor access via wholesale agreements or would they monopoly licensees?", "6869 MS. FENSKE: I think that just in terms of some of the specifics around those proposals, what I can advise in terms of the AAC. So MKO was supporting in principle the position of the AAC with respect to both broadband deployment funding mechanisms and the AFM, which I know is not the subject of your question. To that and MKO retained an expert and technical advisor. So John Todd of Elenchus Research has been assisting MKO in its participation. We have had early and frequent engagement with the folks at AAC. Mr. Todd has maintained an ongoing dialogue with their expert, Mr. Sepulveda, from early on in the development of their proposal.", "6870 So we have confidence in their proposal so the specifics that are relating to -- that are part and parcel of AAC's proposal, MKO accepts that and has confidence in that and supports that.", "6871 To the extent that there are unique aspects to the experiences of Northern First Nations that the CRTC should take into account alongside AAC's proposal we hopefully can assist in understanding that.", "6872 ", "UNDERTAKING", "6873 MS. FENSKE: But ultimately the BDFM is AAC's proposal. So if you think that we are looking for more specific comments from MKO in terms of competitor access versus monopoly licensing, I would ask that we be able to take an undertaking with respect to that particular question as well.", "6874 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sure, that\u2019s fine with us.", "6875 And would the retail rates be regulated by the CRTC?", "6876 MS. FENSKE: So, yes, they would be under that proposal.", "6877 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So retail rates on First Nations would be regulated by CRTC, just to confirm?", "6878 ", "UNDERTAKING", "6879 MS. FENSKE: My initial answer is yes, and I would like to confirm with my client on that matter.", "6880 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Certainly. You are keeping a list, right?", "6881 Just making sure we are keeping up too.", "6882 And more curiously, do you see this as an opportunity primarily for joint ventures with First Nations communities or primarily dealing with First Nations providers on a First Nation to First Nation basis?", "6883 MS. FENSKE: I think that the way we discussed the -- and that goes back to some of our submissions that directly relate to the principles around PSAB or debt procurement strategy and what that might mean in terms of impact for First Nations, I think that we kind of weighted that as being -- and the short answer is yes, both of those things could be an opportunity and so the main objective is ensuring that a community is -- that minimum standards are met in the First Nation. And so if that is being done by -- directly by a service provider that -- and if there is opportunities for there to be joint ventures, if that's of interest to the community and that that opportunity is presented, that we see the encouragement and promotion of First Nation businesses as an important opportunity.", "6884 So wherever that is possible, there would be a preference towards promoting and ensuring that First Nation businesses flourish. That said the ultimate objective is that those minimum standards are met across the First Nations that MKO represents.", "6885 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Just one more on BDFM is that I was trying to get a handle on it because you spoke about local decision makers being involved in the process and that and at the same time it's a CRTC licence.", "6886 And we're not in Northern Manitoba so there is a bit of distance there between local decision makers and decision makers being made here, not that we wouldn't be sensitive to that.", "6887 I was just a little unclear on how local decision makers would be engaged in this licensing process. Perhaps if you could fill that out for me a little that would be great.", "6888 MS. FENSKE: Sure. So at a practical level in terms of the initial foray into the auction process, if you had a kind of RFP-type or request for proposal that there would be built into that that the -- whoever is bidding would have to be advising the CRTC what kind of relationship building has been done in terms of the First Nations that they are proposing to provide services to. And again, with a designated preference towards First Nations businesses or First Nations ventures then you would -- that would be a part of the criteria that you would be assessing bids on the basis of. Those would be some important principles to take into consideration.", "6889 On a go-forward basis, we have also been advocating more involved monitoring and enforcement efforts and it would be through that monitoring process that you as a regulator would potentially be having a kind of ongoing communication with the communities that are being served in terms of the fund administrator reporting back or, pardon me, between service providers reporting to the fund administrator or the CRTC directly however it's setup, but that there would be that link in terms of communicating the responsiveness of the service provider and that there would be more -- because there would be a more robust monitoring and enforcement aspect of things that that would be one avenue for linking the communities with the regulator directly and having those community voices heard.", "6890 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "6891 You talked about -- expressed concern about ensuring a good transition to fully digital services and how if internet service is part of the basic service definition, it can provide POTS through VoIP. So do you believe subsidy regimes should exist for both POTS, landline POTS and internet access and, if so, how is it that justified given that the latter can provide the former in terms of telephony?", "6892 MS. FENSKE: I think that -- certainly, and so with respect to that, I think that our answer to that question would be fairly consistent with what I believe you heard from AAC yesterday in terms of recognizing that we are in a period of transition.", "6893 So it may not be that the continued regime around POTS continues into the indefinite future but, certainly, for the time being POTS still remains a very important aspect for certain consumers in First Nations and our ultimate -- our client's ultimate position is that no consumer in their communities should be left behind, no MKO citizen should be left behind.", "6894 So in recognizing that that is a -- it could be termed and this market is certainly a smaller number of people as access to internet and what the internet encompasses increases but that there should be at the very least a kind of transition away from it, if that is the direction that the CRTC would have, was it shouldn't be done in the immediate sense because POTS still remains an important aspect for telecommunications services for some MKO citizens.", "6895 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "6896 The recent federal budget designated, I think, $255 million for broadband and infrastructure for indigenous people in remote areas. Do you see that having an impact on this discussion in the short term?", "6897 MS. FENSKE: I think in terms of the short term, I think that it offers an opportunity that there is not a one-size-fits-all or one party which there was a right or responsibility lies that there is going to be a combination of different forces be it market forces cooperating and working collaboratively with government investment. That is an important promise that has a lot of potential but it remains to be seen whether that -- how that money flows out and to which areas and which communities and the impact that it actually has.", "6898 So given that -- well, what our ultimate position is, is that the time for including a basic -- including broadband in a basic service objective is now that certainly there may be some avenues for government investment but that there needs to be minimum standards and minimum investments made that are kind of -- that are guaranteed and that people can see relief in the immediate.", "6899 So it's not clear to me at this time what kind of timeline and how that those investments will be deployed, and so while we are hopeful that it will have a meaningful impact that I think is to hang one's hat on promises, you know commitments that have been made that haven\u2019t yet been deployed or that aren't -- that we can't reflect on could put us even further behind and you could see us in another hearing five years from now still encountering some of the same issues.", "6900 It's really important that we capitalize on opportunities now to make a real difference for MKO citizens and other First Nation citizens' lives.", "6901 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I am also curious to know how this project intersects or potentially overlaps with the work of Broadband Communications North? Because it seems to me that a person could look at their work and say that under the current structure they have achieved some success in terms of providing connectivity to remote First Nations communities and perhaps things should stay the way they are to perhaps spur it a little bit to help them continue their work in that regard, and that this might be interfering with that or interrupting that in some way. Could you address that or is it complementary?", "6902 MS. FESKE: I think it\u2019s complementary and our submissions specifically contemplate, and where we have something kind of to add to the AAC proposal, is specific to the issue of incumbent service providers. And we\u2019ve specifically referenced BCN as that example. So just in terms of a paragraph reference for you, paragraph 132 is where that starts in terms of our further intervention.", "6903 And what we\u2019re saying is that there\u2019s a really important need to recognize the important contributions that those first service providers and the incumbents like BCN have made. Again, going back to my statements in my presentation about where other companies may have feared to tread, they\u2019ve made really important forays into providing services.", "6904 That said, the reality is that for many MKO First Nations, they are still not reaching what we would expect to see as a minimum service standard, notwithstanding the important contributions that providers like the BCN have made.", "6905 And so in any sort of deployment fund, that goes back to your earlier question about community voices and having communities heard. What we envision as happening is where you have an incumbent service provider, it really should be up to the community as to whether what they\u2019ve been doing has been adequate.", "6906 And so where you have a service provider who\u2019s made inroads into a community, who\u2019s developed good relationships, who\u2019s doing the best that they can in the circumstances, in the market and regulatory regime that we have now, it may be that a community wants to see that provider in their First Nation continue to flourish with the support that they would be able to access under potentially the BDFM model.", "6907 And so the idea would be that if the incumbent had that relationship with the community where the community is happy with their services and happy with the potential opportunities to improve on those services based on the incentives and the support that could be available through a mechanism like a BDFM, that those would be very intertwined and complementary to each other.", "6908 And I\u2019m not specifying any particular service provider here, but if a service provider has not been adequately meeting the needs of the community or responsive, then again that\u2019s up to the community to say, \u201cYou know, you haven\u2019t been effective and we think that there should be an open bidding process here.\u201d", "6909 And so again, putting a lot of the direction and, you know, recognizing that communities themselves, that the First Nations themselves have a voice in this, and that they have important messages that need to be heard by the regulator and via service providers directly.", "6910 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks.", "6911 In paragraph 158 of your submission you discussed situations where some First Nations may want a higher minimum level of service than that mandated by us. ", "6912 So are you open to a model such as proposed by some intervenors in this, call it skinny broadband if you want, where a basic level is mandated by us and that subsidy only apply to that, but that access to higher levels of service also be there for those who wish to purchase them? And that this could be managed not necessarily by a broader fund, but on a First-Nation-by-First-Nation basis or financed that way?", "6913 MS. FENSKE: Yes, that\u2019s consistent with our submissions on that point, certainly.", "6914 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you.", "6915 The AAC proposal supports 10 down and 3 up as a basic standard. But there\u2019s some evidence -- I\u2019ll point to one here in Rogers\u2019 second intervention at paragraph 33 where they argue and others do that 5 and 1 are sufficient to meet basic needs including Skype. Is that not the case?", "6916 MS. FENSKE: In terms of commenting specifically on the 5 and 1, I\u2019ll note simply that for many MKO First Nations the service levels are not even meeting that threshold. So that\u2019s the starting point for the experience of First Nation communities of my plan.", "6917 When it comes to specific targets, whether it\u2019s 10/3 or 5 and 1, MKO has very deliberately stayed away from advocating a particular target speed on what\u2019s the right bandwidth for Canadians. What MKO is saying is that First Nations and in particular the northern First Nations like the ones MKO serves, should have access to the same speeds as the rest of Canada.", "6918 And so the minimum standards that are workable for someone in an urban setting are potentially less sufficient for many MKO First Nations because those in an urban centre are not as completely dependent on the internet for their basic needs as I kind of elaborated in some of my earlier comments.", "6919 So with that, we think that whatever the minimum standard is -- or the standard set should be a floor not a ceiling, and then whatever that minimum standard is should be applicable across Canada so that First Nations are not further disadvantaged and remote and northern communities are not further disadvantaged from their urban counterparts in terms of their connectivity to the internet.", "6920 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. Do you think those communities would be comfortable with a situation where they had the same minimum standards, access to the same minimums as everybody else, and understand that in areas where market forces are significantly more vibrant that while they would have equal access to the same floor, that the ceiling would likely be different? Do you think communities would be accepting of that reality?", "6921 MS. FENSKE: I kind of want to address this in two ways.", "6922 The first is just to say that in setting any standards that they should be something that is not stagnant and that there\u2019s a process in place for it to evolve, and so that as technology continues to improve, that the standards are flexible enough or that the principles around the standards are flexible enough that the minimum standard can move with the increase in technological advancements.", "6923 When it comes to this idea of -- and these are not your words; I respect that. But the idea that for remote and isolated communities maybe it just can\u2019t be done in terms of that higher level. What I might to say to that is I don\u2019t expect that we would accept that premise, especially when we\u2019re considering that we\u2019re talking about the telecommunications industry and services. If there is any industry where the sky is the limit and where you can count of innovative and creative advancements, it\u2019s with that technology sector. ", "6924 And so we\u2019re advocating for a minimum standard that needs to be met for all Canadians.", "6925 But we think that it\u2019s within the CRTC\u2019s jurisdiction to also set aspirational goals, to set a goal, issue that challenge, and properly incentivize it. And there\u2019s no guarantees that that will translate back to those remote and isolated communities, but that should be the starting point in terms of trying to maximize the opportunities for success for everyone involved.", "6926 And so in representing, you know, northern First Nation communities and that married with the technology sector, I just don\u2019t know that we can accept that there\u2019s not a solution out there when we see how far we\u2019ve come from even, you know, 30 years ago when the internet was, you know, an idea in someone\u2019s imagination to now. And that just again goes back to our earlier point about the need for these goals and targets to be responsive to the technological advancements that are available.", "6927 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That was elegantly answered. Thank you.", "6928 The last area was you talked quite a bit about service standards. And I\u2019m at least a little unclear on the nature of whether the licensees are monopolistic or not. ", "6929 And it\u2019s one of the issues that comes before us, is that one of the better ways to enforce service standards is to have a competitive framework, so there is an option if somebody is not maintaining high service, quality of service to go to somebody who will in terms of that. ", "6930 So what do you think is more important, the provision of -- or sort of how would you have us enforce those basic service standards or would you not prefer a model where there was competitor access so that competition would serve that need. ", "6931 MS. FENSKE: I think that for the -- for MKO First Nations, the overall objective is to have those standards met. ", "6932 You know, it\u2019s one of the reasons why our submissions have been technology neutral, why we haven\u2019t suggested a -- or particularized the bandwidth that we would suggest. It\u2019s that however it happens, that it -- that First Nations not be left behind, and no consumer being left behind, and in particular First Nations not be left behind. ", "6933 And so I think you can look to our submissions on monitoring and enforcement where the -- there would be an administrator would have the role of ensuring that performance criteria was set for a service provider contract, that that\u2019s respected, and if that service provider is not able to meet the needs of the community or not able to meet the standard set, that, yeah, that a competitive bidding process should be in place. ", "6934 We also recognize the reality of MKO First Nations communities and their experience to date has been that one of the reasons why they are so often left behind is that there\u2019s just not an appetite from the market to serve these communities. ", "6935 And so that, again, just goes back to ensuring that there\u2019s proper incentives and funding mechanisms in place to attract service providers to the underserved and unserved First Nations communities. ", "6936 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you. Those are my questions. I\u2019ll turn you back over to the chairman and my colleagues and I expect ultimately our legal staff. Thank you. ", "6937 MS. FENSKE: Thank you. ", "6938 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, I\u2019ve polled colleagues and legal staff and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s luckily or unluckily for you, there are no other questions. So I appreciate you having participated. ", "6939 There were a number of undertakings upfront. As you know, we\u2019ll be publishing today\u2019s transcripts around 11 o\u2019clock local time here in the nation\u2019s capital. So you can look at the beginning of the -- of today\u2019s volume and all the undertakings will be listed there. So, yeah. As a reminder, in case you ---", "6940 MS. FENSKE: Thank you very much.

ANDERSON-KELLETT: Good morning. Thank you, Madam Secretary, and good morning, Chairman, Commissioners and everyone else present here today.", "6953 My name is Lisa Anderson-Kellett and I am the Chairperson of the Deaf Wireless Canada Committee.

To my right is Frank Folino, President of the Canadian Association of the Deaf, and to his right is Executive Director James Roots.", "6954 Before we get into our presentation, there are a couple of items I\u2019d like to address. I'd like Arista to begin with those comments.", "6955 MS. HAAS: Thank you, Lisa.", "6956 I\u2019d like to ask permission to include a report entitled \u201cDear Wireless Survey Analysis\u201d of April 2016. The reason we're asking for permission this morning of the Panel is to have the findings of the report included in the proceedings of which we are here today.", "6957 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. We were aware of the issues because you spoke to legal counsel and we\u2019ll take the decision as to whether to include it or not under advisement, but you can go ahead on the assumption that it is part of the proceeding.", "6958 MS. HAAS: Thank you.", "6959 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: Thank you.", "6960 There is one extra item of business that I'd like to address.", "6961 I would like to ensure or clarify for everyone my role here today is clearly as part of the Deaf Wireless Canadian Committee. I am not here in my capacity as a Director of the Canadian Administrator of Video Relay Service. All information contained in this submission has been in the capacity as my role as a volunteer and not in the capacity of my position as Director of CAV.", "6962 No confidential or proprietary information of CAV was used in the preparation of this or all proceeding or subsequent submissions. And any VRS related comments or queries will be deferred to other members of this committee.", "6963 The mandate. Our committee, we would like to see that wireless service providers provide fair and uniform wireless data plans for all ASL and LSQ users; two, that there are cost-reasonable data plans for all ASL and LSQ users; transparent and clear advertisement of the plans offered by the wireless service providers, and fourth, decrease disparity of product and service provisions within and amongst the various wireless service providers.", "6964 MR. NEWMILLER: So we'd like to focus on issues and concerns between the ASL and LSQ users. Many of them are going over their allotted monthly data limits on their bills and this is due to increased video communications which is causing significant bill shock because of the video communication platforms they are using such as FaceTime, Skype, Glide, and other future video technology that may arise.", "6965 These users pay for voice minutes and plans that they don\u2019t need. Hearing people pay for unlimited voice minutes while deaf people do not have the same functional equivalency. There are several issues with Texting 9-1-1 due to various restrictions.", "6966 And within the wireless service providers, there are a number of issues. A lot of them have a wide disparity offered in the data plans that are not clear and within their own companies, they are not clear and they are not advertised specifically, and there are no fair plans available for ASL and LSQ users and customers.", "6967 When we speak about audio versus video, video uses a greater bandwidth than audio which results in higher data usages or overages, i.e. the bill shock that I spoke of previously.", "6968 When deaf users receive their bill, they're often shocked at the amount of the bill and did not realize that they had overseeded their data allotment.", "6969 The average data plan today is 6 gigabits and most deaf users today are using Glide, FaceTime, Skype, and in the future, with the greater dependency on video conferencing, video communication, this number will rise.", "6970 And so just like hearing callers and their voice plans, they have unlimited minutes, we also are promoting the same functional equivalence to have unlimited data use for video conversation communication.", "6971 MS. MARSH: We conducted a Canada-wide survey which provided 905 valid responses that we could analyze.", "6972 Eight-one (81) percent of the respondents were deaf, hard of hearing, and deafblind.", "6973 Fifty-three (53) percent of the respondents still have a house landline phone in order to communicate over their TTY so they are able to communication with 9-1-1. Eighty-four (84) percent plan to cancel their home line plans and begin using wireless technology with the next three years.", "6974 Eighty-three (83) percent use video communications currently on their smart phones. Popular choices right now are Glide, FaceTime, and Skype.", "6975 Sixty-eight (68) percent of the respondents currently have one or two-year contracts, 20 percent have plans or unlocked smartphones with month-to-month plans, while another 12 percent have other options. ", "6976 Eighty-six (86) percent are not aware of voice credited or voice removed plan options. They\u2019re just simply unaware. Fifty-four (54) percent of the respondents required two to six gigabytes of wireless data plans to ensure their current wireless needs.", "6977 The top four needs for visual communication today are texting, emailing, photo communication, and video communication. ", "6978 Fifty-three (53) percent of the survey respondents went over their data plan limit, while 45 percent of them were very careful and stayed within their limits, and the rest simply didn\u2019t know. This indicates that the amount of gigabytes given do not meet the consumer needs. ", "6979 To date, and because of our survey findings, we wanted to propose four recommendations grouped into four categories. First, transparency; second, consumer education to ASL and LSQ users; affordability; and also accessibility. ", "6980 Speaking about the first recommendation, transparency, targeted marketing to ASL and SLQ users. Data plans with voice credits should be clearly advertised in ASL and LSQ with clearly written English and French. The promotion of these wireless plans need to be increased in visual -- increased in digital and print medias, as well as videos in sign language in both ASL and LSQ.", "6981 Deaf Canadians prefer an unlimited data plan. To date it is not possible. And if it\u2019s not offered they should be provided with a 10 to 12 gigabyte package without an overage penalty if they were to overcede that limit, and greater and symmetrical bandwidth for download and upload speeds with no throttling from LTE to 3G should be provided for absolute clear video communication. ", "6982 Our second recommendation, consumer education. Create consumer educational videos in ASL and LSQ to explain the telecommunications system, as well as a joint committee to oversee the initiative. Wireless service providers to start creating terminology in ASL and LSQ videos for users to understand and navigate their wireless service contracts.", "6983 The WSPs are also suggested to co-host workshops with the Canadian Association of the Deaf to educate ASL and LSQ users such as how to file a complaint with the CCTS, the Commissioner for Complaints for Telecommunications Services. ", "6984 Our third recommendation, affordability, is to create a telecommunication accessibility fund pooled by the wireless service providers. Provide those with low income smartphones and data plan packages in order to have access to video communication. Utilize the contingency fund for projects to develop educational videos to address the communication gap. And to create employment opportunities for training in ASL and LSQ using those employees to provide customer service directly in sign language.", "6985 The fourth recommendation on accessibility, the existing text with 9-1-1 system. It needs to be overhauled to improve the effectiveness and efficiency for all consumers, including ASL and LSQ users. A symmetrical 10 megabytes per second for download and upload speed should be the minimum standard for all wireless communications. ", "6986 And wireless service providers should also invest in ASL and LSQ users to ensure that communications are received in those languages. And the options we suggest are employ ASL and LSQ users as customer service representatives or CSRs. Invest in extensive training for employees who are willing to learn new languages, specifically ASL and LSQ to provide customer service to those consumers. And also, provide sign language interpretation upon request.", "6987 Again on our fourth recommendation regarding accessibility, direct video communication in ASL for our ASL and LSQ users provided by the CCTS and the CRTC in order to log complaints and queries. ", "6988 Through our findings and research, we noted that since 2008 different parties party to different recommendations and interventions before the CRTC have made note. And we, the Deaf Wireless Canadian Committee, are in full support of having someone deaf, ASL or LSQ, be employed and be involved at a decision-making level, to be involved in the decision-making process when navigating the future of video communication. Because after all it is 2016 and we should have those people clearly in place to help make those decisions. ", "6989 Part of why we say it is 2016 is because we feel that from 2008 until now there\u2019s been many, many referrals and references to an accessibility office and that has yet to be in place. And that\u2019s where we feel strongly that we need a person with ASL or LSQ (inaudible) experience be involved in such an office at a decision-making level.", "6990 THE CHAIRPERSON: So thank you for your presentation. I\u2019ll start off the questions for you.", "6991 My first question deals with the mandate of your group.", "6992 THE SECRETARY: I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Chairman, we have another presentation to hear before.", "6993 THE CHAIRPERSON: Oh, sorry.", "6994 THE SECRETARY: We\u2019re going to hear the presentation of the Canadian Association of the Deaf, which is sitting at the table with (inaudible).", "6995 THE CHAIRPERSON: I apologize, I thought there was only one presentation.", "6996 THE SECRETARY: It\u2019s okay. ", "6997 You may begin, Mr. Folino.", "6998 MR. FOLINO: Good morning, Chairman, Commissioners, legal staff, other staff, people in the audience, people who are watching, and the audience across Canada. ", "6999 My name is Frank Folino. I\u2019m the President of the Canadian Association of the Deaf. As Lisa mentioned already, this is James Bruce. He's our executive director here to my right. ", "7000 The Canadian Association of the Deaf is a national organization. We collect and research information, we disseminate the information, we teach the community, and we do deaf advocacy across Canada. We support people who have similar interests and means. ", "7001 We've been established since 1940 and we promote, protect the rights and needs and concerns for those individuals who are linguistically and culturally deaf who use American Sign Language and langue des signes des qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, or LSQ.", "7002 The Canadian Association of the Deaf has made an estimate that in 2016 across Canada have approximately 350,000 culturally deaf people, and that's an increase over a few years ago. ", "7003 This estimate is based on a population of 35 million here in Canada and the statistic is 10 percent of the population. ", "7004 As the previous group mentioned, we know that there are severe financial barriers to the deaf community and to deaf Canadians to participate in the digital economy. In relation to that, there's a lack of education to LSQ and ASL users to understand what the internet packages are provided and are available in the marketplace.", "7005 I want to mention that the World Federation of the Deaf and their statement on the adaption and adoption of technology and accessibility, made in October of 2014, clearly shows that deaf people are taking advantage on our early adopters on advancing technology and using it towards communication and approving the quality of living.", "7006 Access to information is important to meet their needs for visual communication like YouTube with captioning; services supplied online using sign language, for example, relay services like video relay interpreting and video relay service, as well as other emerging technology.", "7007 We would like to mention that video relay service -- we want to emphasize that this is a basic telecommunications service. For the -- and it's provision on a national level for ASL and LSQ users. Video relay service reduces barriers to communication that we're experiencing right now without it. ", "7008 We have limited ability to be part of the fabric of Canadian society and we see major benefits of having the service for deaf and hearing individuals. It will give us functional equivalency when it comes to communication in the same way that hearing people use their telephone and other methods of communication.", "7009 The Canadian administrator of VRS has announced it will be internet based. They will use smart phones, apps, tablets, and other web-based technology.", "7010 The reason why we emphasize that VRS is a basic communication service is it has been said it will be supported with -- it's eligible for funding in accordance with the Telecommunication Act under section 46.5 (1), which states that the Commissioner may require any telecommunication service provider to contribute subject to any conditions that the Commission may set to fund and support continuing access by Canadians to telecommunication services. So we want to add that telecommunication services should be recognized as a basic service. ", "7011 The issues of concern related to technology, as you are all aware, is that technology is changing very quickly. Within five years we will see many advances and Canadian infrastructure is falling behind. Steps need to be taken to catch up.", "7012 Broadband internet services must be defined as a basic service, particularly for ASL and LSQ users because of the establishment of video relay service, and this is important to give us accessibility. The video communication needs will require fluid transmission.", "7013 Your suggestion that the download speed and the upload speeds will not meet our needs because low speeds won't meet our needs for video transmission as well as data transmission. ", "7014 A perfect example of this is we tried to upload a 30 -- a video clip and it took 36 hours to upload a 10-minute video clip at 1 megabytes per second. With this, it will cause low-quality communication when it comes to VRS and VRI. We suggest that there should be no throttling on data when it comes to video communications. ", "7015 We also recognize that in the Northern Territories, that the technology is further behind because of the 3G networks and they don\u2019t have access to LTE, so we're concerned that will affect our community's communication.", "7016 The situation for the deaf who live in northern community means that they're very isolated, they are limited economically, they have limited access to telecommunication because of the 3G network. ", "7017 We call it a language deprivation because they don\u2019t have the ability to access communication in their first and Native language, ASL or LSQ.", "7018 Our recommendation, when it comes to technology and internet service, we would ask that the telecommunication service providers provide a minimum of 25 megabytes per minute -- sorry, per second, with 10 megabytes per second upload and at least 100 gigabytes of data. ", "7019 Because of the nature of high speed, this is necessary to provide access to VRI and VRS. We use high definition video quality and we recommend no throttling. That way, ASL and LSQ users can access communication technology.", "7020 The Commission has an office called the Consumer Affairs and Strategic Planning and Social Policy Office, the SPO, so we recommend that we have the equivalent of the Disability Access Office, the DAO, that the FCC provides. ", "7021 So far, there are no ASL or LSQ individuals that I know of at the CRTC that have its own experience or expertise with the disability lens. We recommend that the CRTC should employ persons with disabilities and ASL and LSQ users for these positions. They can provide accessibility lenses on all its decisions, published policies, research, and regulatory framework for all accessibility issues related to telecommunication services.", "7022 The last recommendation is the TAF, the Telecom Accessibility Fund. The Commission has created a number of other funds for specific purposes, some related to accessibility, such as the BAF, the Broadcasting Accessibility Fund. ", "7023 CAD recommends that a separate fund be established as a Telecommunication Accessibility Fund, or the TAF. ", "7024 With the TAF we would emphasize that all telecommunications service providers, telephone providers, wireless providers should contribute to that fund in a way to grow the fund for the purpose of accessibility needs.", "7025 With this fund, ASL and LSQ users would be able to access any of the providers\u2019 services. The money should be available nationally and should meet rural and urban users, both ASL and LSQ.", "7026 There should be a subsidized internet package for low-income users so they can have reasonable access to data plans and communications.", "7027 And finally, that funding could also be used to develop and create educational videos in ASL and LSQ so the deaf community can understand what\u2019s available in their first language.", "7028 Thank you very much for your time for allowing us the opportunity to make a submission. And I look forward to your questions.", "7029 THE CHAIRPERSON: I think I jumped the gun earlier; I apologize for that. I thought it was a joint presentation.", "7030 So as I said, I\u2019m going to have a few questions and obviously some of them are specific to each presenter and then there are others that both groups may choose to address.", "7031 So my first question, though, is more specifically to the DWCC. And I notice that your mandate refers to fair and uniform wireless data plans. I mean, you\u2019ve chosen to use the word \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cuniform\u201d, those two words, and I was wondering if you could put a little bit more meat around that bone so that we understand what you mean about \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cuniform\u201d, and specifically around the word \u201cuniform\u201d.", "7032 As you know, we tend to put emphasis on communication that is competitive and uniformity might be seen as not quite in line with a notion of a competitive market, if everything is the same.", "7033 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: Sure. Thank you for that question.", "7034 We certainly recognize the competition in our economy and we encourage competition. But specifically what we mean might be better displayed by example.", "7035 With a number of deaf people we\u2019re all using the same wireless service provider; we\u2019re customers of the same provider. And we all have different gigabyte allowances. For example, some of us might have 2 gigabytes and I might pay $45 and another person may pay $65 and another person may pay $35. And someone else may actually only pay $15 by way of credit.", "7036 So our point when we say \u201cuniform\u201d is to have the WSPs, the wireless service providers, institute a uniformity in terms of what gigabyte package and price point they\u2019re going to give deaf persons within their same package plan. We did not mean to have all companies follow a uniform and fair package or standard for these gigabyte plans.", "7037 Of course \u201cfair\u2019 we want to emphasize something that meets our needs as deaf users and uniformity within the company themselves.", "7038 Does anyone want to add anything? And Arista is indicating she would like to add something. ", "7039 MS. HAAS: An example of Lisa\u2019s example and one way to increase fairness, one company AT&T, they have established a plan that meets the needs of hard of hearing and speech impaired users. And they have one package with various options. They may have a 6-gigabyte plan at $50 per month with various options and features and then they\u2019ll have a higher plan at 12 gigabytes, 15 gigabytes, et cetera. ", "7040 So deaf Americans can look at that company based on their needs and determine which package suits their needs based on the features provided. And that information is included in our findings report that we\u2019ve included for your review.", "7041 THE CHAIRPERSON: So do I take it that uniform does not mean identical?", "7042 MS. HAAS: Right. I guess our point is not to have it -- we want to decrease the disparity within those plans. ", "7043 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: And if I could add something. Within the wireless service providers when they have a specific plan, when deaf people have gone into that particular company and said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen you\u2019ve advertised this plan; my friend also has this plan. I\u2019d like to sign up for it.\u201d But once they receive their bill they realize that what they thought they were getting isn\u2019t actually what they received and what was offered. And so that\u2019s one example that we\u2019ve heard of happen to many of our constituents.", "7044 THE CHAIRPERSON: When you look at the wireless service providers in the country or the wireline service providers in the country, is there one in your view that, although imperfect, is perhaps closer to what you would hope? Or should we look as a model, you mentioned AT&T; do we have to go south to find best practices?", "7045 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: The last part of our survey there is a screenshot, various screenshots that compares all of the Canadian wireless service providers, showing their accessibility pages that they currently have. And then you see in very, very fine print at the bottom it says, \u201cDeaf people can get plans.\u201d And then we looked over to the States, AT&T, Wireless, Sprint, and the various companies they have, and they have a very clear, large spot on their website and other advertising showing the various plans specific for the deaf and hard of hearing communities. But in Canada we didn\u2019t find any clear advertisement or display. ", "7046 With Manitoba Telecommunication or Telecom, MTS, they had something there. And that was the only obviously example or indication display of what type of services would be offered for the deaf community. But the others were very vague, very hard to find. So we want to see something clear, easy, and upfront that deaf people can either find within minutes, if not even seconds, on their website or the minute they walk into a company\u2019s front door to get service. They want to be able to see that information clearly and see their various options. Right now that\u2019s not available.", "7047 MR. NEWMILLER: In addition to that, they may see something advertising and go into the store and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen this plan advertised\u201d and the staff at the various telecom providers or wireless service providers are not aware of those promotions or plans. And it seems the frontline staff need greater education or training to keep up-to-date with some of the promotions that are being offered across Canada currently. Because right now, deaf Canadians are not getting that transparent information and it\u2019s -- they\u2019re just not -- it\u2019s just not working right now.", "7048 THE CHAIRPERSON: Based on your knowledge, and I\u2019m addressing this question to both groups, are there any Canadian service providers that are able to provide you currently ASL or LSQ interaction? ", "7049 I know, for instance, and we\u2019ve heard in other proceedings that some major telecommunication companies obviously hire people from their local community and that means that there\u2019s all kinds of multilingual capacity within their workforce. And sometimes those employees are called upon to help out in customer relations using that language of that individual. ", "7050 So I was wondering if, to your knowledge, any of the -- whether it\u2019s the wireless providers or the wireline providers, are you aware of any one of them following a similar course?", "7051 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: To answer that question, I\u2019m unaware of any direct frontline services provided in sign language. But I am aware of some deaf individuals working at TELUS. But I haven\u2019t seen any frontline staff within the system. Perhaps in the backend, the administration staff, they may have some deaf employees there. ", "7052 However, through this group I am learning more about some of the wireless service providers, indicating to us as a committee that they do intend to provide sign language interpreters as they do recognize that they need to improve their communication with their customers and also increase their advertising efforts to our community.", "7053 THE CHAIRPERSON: Does the Canadian Association of the Deaf have a view on this?", "7054 MR. FOLINO: Yes. To my knowledge, I haven\u2019t seen any frontline deaf employees. Perhaps they work at headquarters, but they\u2019re not frontline individuals. They\u2019re not in the retail store. Out of all of the different organizations I haven\u2019t seen any frontline staff who use sign language. But any of the telecom service providers maybe. There might be an individual or two who have a little bit of sign language, but they\u2019re not fluent to meet our needs. ", "7055 We need someone who can sign fluently, someone who has that accessibility lens who can bring up our issues and to meet our needs. This is very important and we\u2019d like to see this happen. Alternatively, you could bring an interpreter, someone who is a qualified interpreter to provide ASL or LSQ on request.", "7056 THE CHAIRPERSON: When we look at consumer behaviour over time and we track it in our communication monitoring report, we\u2019re obviously saying that people are relying more and more on wireless technology, and as a result, wireline technology is evolving. And I think you\u2019ve made similar points here today.", "7057 I was wondering, in light of that, is the TTY service still useful? And do you see that perhaps fading over time?", "7058 MS. NEWMILLER: Over the years TTY has caused us so many different issues, because first of all, English being not the first language of our community and the operator handling our TTY calls, first of all, don\u2019t have an understanding of deaf culture and they often make assumptions of what we mean instead of what we\u2019re saying. And so that right from the get go leads to miscommunication with our telephone communications. And often we find that out later as a follow-up when we meet that person we were speaking with in person. ", "7059 So TTY communication is frustrating. It leads to miscommunication. And because of that and because of the emerging video communication, we have noticed much greater reduction in miscommunication when we have communicated over video and in our first language.", "7060 So to answer your question, the TTY has already been on the outs, if you will, for the last 10 years. It\u2019s not being used that much at all. ", "7061 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: And Lisa\u2019s saying, thank you, Rytch. I think -- well, Nicole wanted to mention something from our survey.", "7062 MS. MARSH: Yes, 71 percent of the respondents said that within the last number of years, 5 years, they have decreased their use of TTY communication. And it\u2019s just like if you look to the general population and the use of the rotary telephone, the numbers almost match up. So it\u2019s similar -- it\u2019s a similar trend. ", "7063 And also, part of our survey findings is that those who responded to our survey said within the next three years they will no longer chose to use TTY. They will adopt wireless communication for all their communication needs going forward.", "7064 MS. NEWMILLER: And Rytch is also adding, to understand, you know, especially what\u2019s coming this fall with the video relay service, we understand and know that that will increase our communication and increase the quality of our communication. So many people are just waiting for that service to be implemented and then they will no longer be using TTYs at all. They will be relying on VRS and other forms of wireless communication. ", "7065 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: And so to summarize our response, and from our observations, senior citizens, they rely on the older system of TTYs. Where I work, in my workplace, there are a number of deaf people there that we serve -- well, I work alongside with deaf people but also our clients are deaf. And our perspective is that all options should be kept based on the individual\u2019s preference. ", "7066 So of course we have wireless, soon video relay, IP relay, TTY, et cetera. But TTY is not used currently by the younger generations.", "7067 MR. ROOTS: Hi, this is James. You have to remember that hard of hearing individuals are still using TTY. Those of us who are here today don\u2019t represent the hard of hearing community. The deaf community and culturally deaf have stopped using the TTY fairly back quite some time ago. There -- okay. ", "7068 CAD stopped using the TTY about three years ago. And the reason being is, in the last seven years we\u2019ve received three TTY calls and they\u2019re all from the same individual. So we didn\u2019t see the point in spending the money to keep the TTY up and running. We decided to cut that service. And we\u2019re a deaf organization. Why would we get rid of the TTY? But it\u2019s obvious that the deaf community is not using the TTY a lot.", "7069 MR. FOLINO: Hi, this is Frank. And just related to that, many deaf people are looking forward to video relay service. We see this as a game changer. This is going to advance the quality of our lives. Once VRS is in place and it\u2019s up and running in ASL and LSQ, I see our community just really growing. You\u2019re going to see a lot of changes. I see that the TTY needs will diminish significantly. ", "7070 So I would ask you to consider why we\u2019re emphasizing VRS should be considered a basic telecommunication service because we foresee this really taking off. This is going to impact the economy. This is going to make a lot of new developments in the future, and this old technology isn\u2019t going to meet our needs. We\u2019re looking to the future.", "7071 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for that, and I take it you\u2019re saying to us that we should be cautious about getting rid of any of the services we have currently.", "7072 Now, maybe just so I understand, many of us when we are on our wireless devices, knowing that often times going over our data caps can be quite expensive, we choose -- and it\u2019s quite reasonable -- even with wireless devices, to use WiFi, other WiFi that we have in our home or Wi-Fi that\u2019s available in restaurants or other businesses.", "7073 And I was wondering if you could help me understand the behaviour in your community, whether it\u2019s similar or not and to what extent you\u2019re able to individually or collectively manage some of the limitations that you mentioned, both in terms of cost and technology to, for instance, use video communication services?", "7074 MR. NEWMILLER: Well, there are some very educated individuals that have a good understanding of gigabytes and what the limitations are for using it and not.", "7075 Now, just to give you an example, with senior citizens, a lot of them are not using the internet. And so some of them that are using some smartphones, they don\u2019t have a good understanding of what WiFi is or how to use it. So therefore, they\u2019re not using a lot. ", "7076 And newcomers to Canada who are deaf that start using smartphones and wireless technology, they\u2019re just on the cusp of learning what that means, but it really varies from province to province and where you live.", "7077 Some deaf individuals have a good understanding of technology and they go into the store and they say, \u201cOkay, so when I\u2026\u201d -- you know, they\u2019ll ask pertinent questions based on their day-to-day use. But often they leave the store with the understanding that it\u2019s unlimited service.", "7078 So often the advertising from the wireless service providers will say \u201cunlimited texting,\u201d and they understand that to mean video-communication as well because it\u2019s not clearly defined. ", "7079 So they leave the store with the understanding of, you know, unlimited texting, such and such allowance of gigabytes. I doubt highly that they have a clear understanding, and I base that on the fact that the advertising isn\u2019t clear. ", "7080 If there were communications in ASL and LSQ to explain what does gigabytes mean; how does this impact your monthly bill; how is it used; where can you use Wi-Fi; when should you use Wi-Fi? All those sort of questions that perhaps we take for granted, that education has not yet been made to the deaf community and it\u2019s pertinent and important for us going forward.", "7081 MS. HAAS: I want to add to Rytch\u2019s comment -- this is Arista. A lot of deaf communities understand or have a lack of understanding between data and device -- data on their device and then data allowances.", "7082 Let\u2019s say my phone has 64 gigabytes, they understand that to be perhaps their allowance, rather than that\u2019s the capacity of the device itself rather than the data allowance they\u2019ll receive monthly from their wireless service provider. So that\u2019s something I often see as misunderstood within my community and is something that truly does need to be articulated well to our community.", "7083 MR. FOLINO: Can I add to that?", "7084 When it comes to the device, that was a great example. When video relay service is established, I believe that we\u2019re going to face similar experiences. Members of our community are not going to be experienced with VRS and will need to learn how it\u2019s used.", "7085 I think it\u2019s important that training is provided to educate everyone who works at telecommunication services to understand deaf culture and perhaps for individuals to learn sign language and to be knowledgeable in answering questions when it comes to wireless products, so that there\u2019s clear transparency to the deaf and hard of hearing users. That\u2019s very important.", "7086 THE CHAIRPERSON: The point you make in this regard for the deaf community is similar to comments we hear from the non-deaf community because it is new technology and not everybody has got their heads around how it all works and what capacity is required, and the impacts, and there\u2019s bill-shock.", "7087 So your point is well taken that there is maybe a need for building up capacity and particularly your point with respect to the rollout this September of the VRS, which is obviously -- will have a specific impact on the deaf community.", "7088 I was wondering who should be responsible or what mechanisms could be used to actually the build the capacity, both in the deaf community and the broader community with respect to understanding how to optimize the use of these new technologies, which aren\u2019t always intuitive, in terms of price and caps.", "7089 MS. HAAS: Well, we\u2019ve discussed that numerous times amongst the members of this committee and we believe that education is important. And it\u2019s a collaborative process, an approach between the CRTC, CCTS and the TSPs and the WSPs and also us.", "7090 And also with CAD, I think if there\u2019s somehow that we can all collaborate and come together to address the best way and the approach, I think a discussion is certainly required to start that process, like a P3 approach or something, that sort of concept. But we\u2019re certainly an advocate of a joint approach.", "7091 The Canadian Association of the Deaf clearly is our national association and an organization that we look to, to lead the way. So I believe that a collaboration with CAD, CRTC, the wireless service providers, if we could come together and have a discussion to determine the best approach on how to do that, I think that would be advisable.", "7092 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: And another point is we\u2019re just a group of -- our committee, we are volunteers. We don\u2019t have any funding or any money to provide or to put to that sort of project, but we are certainly willing to refer and work together to make that happen, certainly.", "7093 MS. MARSH: Well, speaking about collaboration, that would assist CRTC and the wireless service providers to understand our community better, to increase a good rapport in a safer environment where communication is clear, understood and where sharing is open and is valued, so that we can provide the best services for our community going forward.", "7094 THE CHAIRPERSON: You mentioned earlier that the packages and services available to the deaf community weren\u2019t always as clearly identified on the various websites of the service providers.", "7095 You also make comments in your presentation about better communication, whether it\u2019s through advertisement or other ways to provide information to the community. ", "7096 I was curious because this can\u2019t be the only area where you need to communicate with the deaf community to share information and developments. For instance, presumably to identify the folks that participate in your survey you had to reach out to people. And by the same token, I assume that the Canadian Association of the Deaf as well has ways of reaching out to the deaf community. ", "7097 And I was wondering why you think, for instance -- one of you has proposed that we use TV advertisement to help inform people which, as you can well imagine, is a very costly solution as opposed to the ways you might be reaching out to the deaf community otherwise?", "7098 MS. MARSH: Well, it\u2019s only specific -- it\u2019s only an issue for the deaf community, but the community would access or have access to the wireless service providers who advertise on television already. And if they are to make the communications available in ASL and LSQ in all sorts of media, which they do on the internet and so forth, but on television there\u2019s a gap there. ", "7099 And if we\u2019re able to get the word out in the language of the deaf community through social media and television media, I think customers would reach out to those particular companies and utilize their service. Otherwise, they\u2019ll be unaware of any services being offered.", "7100 MR. ROOTS: Jim Roots. Your suggestion proposes that the consumer take on the responsibility to get the word out. It\u2019s the wireless service providers to advertise and to make it known. We don\u2019t have the resources to make an ad campaign and to promote the service providers\u2019 products and services. They have the deep pockets. They\u2019re already advertising to other customers in the same way. They just haven\u2019t focused their advertising to our community yet.", "7101 MR. NEWMILLER: I\u2019d like to add something.", "7102 All of us here should have a partnership with the wireless service providers. If there was a new gigabyte plan, for example, then we could collaborate with each other on how we could reach out to our community. Perhaps it would be targeted marketing within various sub-communities within our community. ", "7103 For example, the senior citizens; they may prefer a different type of communication conversely to our other younger population who would love to see those communications over social media but in a blog format. We have to remember too that the WSPs are already marketing to the broader community across Canada. We need targeted marketing, which the funding is available with the WSPs.", "7104 And another thing to consider is a lot of them are asked to be accessible, claim to be accessible. And with that accessibility fund that we suggested earlier, that would be a way to have the targeted marketing of the advertising in ASL and LSQ that we\u2019re speaking of be successful.", "7105 MR. FOLINO: If I could just add to that.", "7106 I just wanted to add it\u2019s important to work together. And we\u2019re here, we\u2019re willing to do that. We\u2019d like to work with the service providers. They obviously have the resources. We don\u2019t have the money and the resources; that\u2019s clear. But we\u2019d like to partner up and work together. We have lots of ideas and suggestions. We have the expertise and the lived experience to increase accessibility. We have all kinds of different ideas. This is good for the community nationwide. ", "7107 We like to see videos in ASL or LSQ. Others have done it. We suggest that this be put onto different websites. We suggest that all service providers do this. Have something available on their websites that we can access the information in our first language. And that will enhance our understanding of what services are available and see which products and services will meet our needs. ", "7108 And that will certainly draw loyal customers. We want to make those connections to the service providers, but in order to do that we need to see information available in Sign, in our first language. We\u2019d like to see other things as well because we can see a benefit, a win-win situation for the community and the service providers. ", "7109 And this also enhances the lives of hearing people too. ", "7110 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: Something that just came to mind that I thought I should mention.", "7111 In Australia their national association has partnered with a wireless service provider, and they partner to make announcements in video in Auslan sign language. And these announcements have been very successful, but they\u2019ve announced different text plans and other wireless plans. So that\u2019s an example to look to in Australia as to something that we\u2019re suggesting happen here. ", "7112 And we have included some of that information, a screenshot with the link provided to that Auslan sign language advertisement that I just spoke of. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019d like to see happen here. A partnership with CAD, for example, and some of the wireless service providers.", "7113 THE CHAIRPERSON: To be clear, I wasn\u2019t suggesting to shift responsibility without resources. I was just exploring when it came to more targeted outreaches whether you\u2019re in a partnership mode had means of doing that that may be more efficient and effective. And I think the answer is yes, and you\u2019ve got an openness to partnering with the communication providers. ", "7114 Now there\u2019s been mention of a telecom accessibility fund. And some parallels have been made with the broadcasting accessibility fund, which was financed through the specific policy and legislative framework that occurs in broadcasting.", "7115 I\u2019d like to get your sense of how you would see the telecom accessibility fund financed. ", "7116 MR. FOLINO: As I mentioned during my presentation, all the telecom service providers could contribute to a fund. The national contribution fund is one example that\u2019s a possibility as well for asking for funds to establish the TAF. Or perhaps it could be another structure, a different way, or a new way of establishing a fund. But I would suggest that the telecommunication providers contribute to it. ", "7117 MR. NEWMILLER: I would like to add to Frank\u2019s comment that there are some Canadians that would contribute or donate to the fund. For example, consumer bills. We could take some money, a tax if you will, or a levy on consumer bills to be specific to that fund so that way it could accommodate all disabilities. And specific monies could be put towards users who are deaf blind, for example.", "7118 So I\u2019m in support of what Frank is saying, but also we could levy some monies off consumer bills. THE CHAIRPERSON: Implicit in what you\u2019re saying is that the source of funds should be the members of the Canadian society that are subscribers to these various communications services. Some could argue that it would be more transparent, that this need be financed through a general tax base as opposed to subscribers if it is a public good. What do you think about that?", "7119 MS. MARSH: When we look at the process now, the non-deaf population don\u2019t use video communication or text communication the way that we do. We rely on it very heavily. And in the States, there was a shift. There used to be prepaid plans but now it\u2019s turned over to unlimited. And perhaps we\u2019ll see a shift here too, a shift to unlimited plans that will give us more accessibility. Perhaps that\u2019s part of the answer.", "7120 And yes, I think, you know, a tax would be a solution to collect those funds necessary to create such a fund.", "7121 MR. ROOTS: If I\u2019m not mistaken, I believe that in telephone bills there\u2019s already a levy there for the relay services, message relay service. There\u2019s already a levy that\u2019s been established. So we could potentially do the same thing for mobile wireless services.", "7122 THE CHAIRPERSON: My last area of inquiry before I turn to my colleagues to see if they have any questions, relates to Text 9-1-1. And I\u2019m trying to have a better understanding of your position with respect to Text 9-1-1 because there are comments that don\u2019t align with my understanding of how Text 9-1-1 operates. ", "7123 There seems to be some suggestions that it\u2019s not free, that somehow subscriber localization is not working, and that it somehow isn\u2019t meeting the needs of the deaf community. And I just really want to understand a little bit better your preoccupation.", "7124 MS. ANDERSON-KELLETT: There are a few issues related to texting 9-1-1. But we wanted to keep it to a minimum here because we see that there\u2019s an upcoming opportunity to be involved in an upcoming CRTC proceeding. But I can speak to some of the concerns that we see now.", "7125 What happens now within the deaf community, as we\u2019ve mention, ASL and LSQ users are often confused. They want their voice plans removed off of their smartphone or other like devices. But the vendors, when they approach them, they know that voice plans are required in order to communicate with Text 9-1-1. So voice plans need to be part of the package plan that you subscribe to in order to have texting with 9-1-1. So that\u2019s a barrier.", "7126 A friend of mine, an anecdote if you will, had an occasion to use text with 9-1-1 -- sorry, they didn\u2019t want the voice minutes, and went in with a provider to ask that package be removed. And then a situation occurred where they couldn\u2019t access Text 9-1-1 because the voice plan was removed. They were unaware of that. ", "7127 So I\u2019m sure that\u2019s happened more than once. And we\u2019ve seen other like or similar issues occur because of not having the information or understanding of what would happen by removing the voice plan and not being able to communicate with 9-1-1 in an emergency.", "7128 But what we\u2019ve seen and what we think could happen is that he wireless service providers need to articulate to the customers that voice plans are required to community by text to 9-1-1. And so in order to have the text to 9-1-1 service you have to have a voice plan. Because how it works is you have to actually dial 9-1-1 on your phone and then once you get connected you can finally text because you\u2019re registered; you have to register in order to start using the service. However, if you haven\u2019t registered you can\u2019t text. So there\u2019s a lot of confusion and uncertainty on how it works.", "7129 I think that whole system needs to be looked at again. And again, the education piece is quite important for our community, to have specific instructions on how to use texting with 9-1-1 and what\u2019s required, and the dangers of removing voice plans and what that means. Because it is a barrier, if they do that, to receiving emergency services. ", "7130 So that\u2019s just one example of what we\u2019ve seen happen. At the next proceeding we\u2019ll certainly be giving you more examples and more information about how we see that service.", "7131 MR. FOLINO: If I could just make another comment? For example, when an individual punches in 9-1-1 it\u2019s a telephone call and they have to wait. I don\u2019t know how long the wait is but there\u2019s a little bit of a delay before someone will text. When the text comes in that\u2019s your opportunity to say, \u201cOkay, this is the emergency. This is the situation.\u201d There\u2019s a little bit of a concern there and particularly when it\u2019s an emergency that involves life and death.", "7132 In the United States, with their 9-1-1 system what they\u2019ve done is you text 9-1-1 and a text immediately goes to a 9-1-1 dispatcher and they reply back with a text.", "7133 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you for that. And as you\u2019ve mentioned there will be other opportunities to explore that issue a little further.", "7134 Commissioner Vennard?", "7135 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Thank you.", "7136 At the beginning of the second presentation, reference was made to the culturally deaf and a statement also made that there are 350,000 culturally deaf Canadians in our country. I\u2019d just like to give you the opportunity to make sure we understand what you mean by culturally deaf and also to make some comments if you like on if their needs are the same or if they are different?", "7137 MR. FOLINO: Culturally deaf means the deaf person is using sign language, either ASL or LSQ. That\u2019s their mode of communication. Non-culturally deaf are people who do not use sign language as their mode of communisation. They may be hard of hearing; they use speech. But when I refer to culturally deaf I mean those of us who use ASL or LSQ.", "7138 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And in your view are there any different requirements or different considerations? Would your recommendations apply to that group of people as well or is there something else that we should be aware of and keep in mind?", "7139 MR. ROOTS: It depends by what you mean by the \u201cother group\u201d. First of all, for example, right now here at the CRTC hearings we have opened captioning available. And we at CAD, we are involved in an initiative right now to test captioning. And it\u2019s surprising how difficult it is to get people to participate, because the interest in captioning has diminished. ", "7140 Individuals, our membership, prefer to look at or watch sign language, either in ASL or LSQ. So individuals who have a hearing loss, who are deafened or who are hard of hearing, who don\u2019t rely on signed languages, they prefer the captioning. ", "7141 So there are very different needs, different preferences amongst the various deaf. ", "7142 Does that answer your question?", "7143 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes. I just wanted to make sure you had the opportunity to expand on that term that -- your term of culturally deaf.

So they\u2019re learning sign language much later in life.", "7146 But those deaf people who were born into deaf families or go to deaf schools, who are surrounded in the culture of deafness, of ASL and SLQ, those are -- that\u2019s where the sense of belonging come in, the sense of identity, by using the shared language.

", "7183 As the record of this proceeding clearly documents, for the majority of Canadians, broadband connectivity has become a basic necessity. ", "7184 It is precisely for this reason that we -- that the vast majority of the submissions in this matter are urging the Commission to recognize this reality by reclassifying broadband or high speed access as a basic service under the Telecommunications Act.", "7185 Only by doing so, the Commission will then be able to develop a systematic approach to ensuring that all Canadians, including those with disabilities, can access affordable and reliable, fixed and mobile internet services that are essential for participation in society and economic activities today.", "7186 We submit that this proceeding offers a unique opportunity for the Commission to demonstrate its commitment to achieving the objectives of the Telecommunications Act by overcoming a missed opportunity in 2011 by excluding broadband from the basic services framework.", "7187 We recognize that the regulated parties participating in this proceeding contend that reforms, such as the ones MAC and other advocates for Canadian consumers have recommended, are unnecessary.", "7188 According to these parties, there is no need for the Commission to do anything as the invisible hand of market forces has already solved all concerns raised by the wide range of parties involved in this process, including rural communities, consumer advocacy groups, and others.", "7189 Laurie?", "7190 MS. ALPHONSE: We strongly disagree with the premise of this argument. For a long time, Canadians with disabilities have expressed considerable concern about the affordability and quality of services that are available to them. ", "7191 Evidence submitted to the record of this proceeding by various parties, as well as the CRTC\u2019s own published data in the 2015 Communications Monitoring report, validates the growing concerns by our stakeholders about the affordability of quality fixed mobile broadband access on which they depend to participate in social and economic activities. ", "7192 There are a number of reasons why broader market trends in terms of prices and service quality are of a particular concern to Canadians with disabilities.", "7193 We will elaborate on these in a minute and outline the specific actions within the scope of this proceeding that the Commission can take to enhance affordability, reliability, and the quality of access to fixed and mobile broadband services and the need for deploying the wide range of information and communications technologies.", "7194 To start, I would like to point out that many trends underlying the calls by various other parties in this proceeding to redefine broadband and basic service were already evident in 2011 when the Commission chose not to include high-speed access in Canada\u2019s basic service framework. ", "7195 Today, five years later, broadband access and mobile networks have become more essential to Canadians, while concerns about affordability and quality have continued to grow.", "7196 MR. BIRCH: The record of this proceeding clearly documents that rural and remote communities have been falling behind due to the relatively limited incentives of service providers to invest in them. While we recognize and support efforts by parties trying to improve rural connectivity, Canadians with disabilities live and work in both rural and urban Canada. ", "7197 Much like in rural communities, incentives of regulated parties to invest in ensuring persons with disabilities with limited financial means or special technical requirements, for example, minimum quality of service guarantees, are relatively limited. ", "7198 Simply put, the rate of return from serving high-cost rural communities or low-income vulnerable groups such as Canadians with disabilities are typically below what those service providers can earn from other ventures or the average consumer. ", "7199 Although 14 percent of Canadians in total might be dealing with the challenges from some form of disability, the range of challenges they face is diverse, which we have detailed using Statistics Canada data in our written submission. ", "7200 For individual network operators to invest in capacity to communicate with and serve the needs of small groups of customers with distinct needs represents a costly exercise. ", "7201 This helps explain why few have made substantive investments in improving accessibility of services they deliver or responding to the efforts of the disability community to enhance the capacity of regulated entities to serve consumers with disabilities.", "7202 We submit that without leadership from the Commission in this matter, there is little evidence on the record of this proceeding to suggest market forces are likely to evolve in a manner that will suddenly make regulated entities invest more in accessibility or become more sensitive to the needs of Canadians with disabilities. ", "7203 Specific proposals submitted by MAC in this matter are intended to provide the Commission with a range of policy measures that it could adopt if it aims to ensure Canadians with disabilities can access basic communications services that are essential to their ability to overcome challenges they face and have the opportunity to participate in social and economic activities afforded by the internet. ", "7204 Given the fact that the federal government has promised to introduce a national Accessibilities Act, our recommendation provides the Commission with the opportunity to take the lead among federal agencies in counteracting barriers facing Canadians with disabilities, at least in terms of access to basic communications services. ", "7205 We submit that redefining broadband access, regardless of the technology and service delivery platform that is both fixed and mobile, as a basic service, represents a necessary first step for ensuring that all Canadians with disabilities can access and use basic communications services they need. ", "7206 Even though incumbent operators generally argue that there are no problems to solve and that the CRTC should continue to exclude broadband from the basic service regime, the record of this proceeding shows that the vast majority of parties agree that the Commission should take the formal step of recognizing that high-speed internet access is, in fact, the most basic form of network communications service, on top of which consumers deploy a wide range of other information and communications services and applications.", "7207 We submit that high-level legal reforms such as redefining broadband access as a basic service will not in itself be sufficient to have a concrete impact on the access of Canadians with disabilities to basic services. ", "7208 Effective mechanisms for implementing any renewed commitments by the Commission would be necessary if the new regulatory framework is to stimulate private sector incentives to serve basic communications service needs of Canadians with disabilities.", "7209 We will now focus on three key concerns of the disability community, as well as the three specific solutions that MAC/Access 2020 Coalition of Disability Stakeholders urge the Commission to adopt and implement pursuant this hearing. ", "7210 These problems and proposed solutions have been outlined in our first submission to the proceeding in general terms and refined in our second submission based on further feedback from our stakeholders and evidence submitted into the record of this proceeding by other parties. ", "7211 It is important to note that none of the other parties participating in this proceeding, including large service providers that dominate Canada\u2019s fixed and mobile broadband markets, have submitted any arguments or evidence opposing or contradicting our proposals. ", "7212 This should not be surprising to the Commission since our proposals are designed to promote demand and reduce the costs that limit the incentives of service providers to improve accessibility and meet the needs of consumers with disabilities.", "7213 In other words, our proposals are designed to offer a win-win solution that should be in the long term interest of both the service providers and Canadians with disabilities. ", "7214 MR. MARTIN: We submit that the level of leadership the Commission is willing to commit to the needs and interests of Canadians with disabilities is critical for balancing short- and long-term interests of the parties.", "7215 On behalf of the diverse range of disability groups that have joined their voices through MAC/Access 2020, we urge the Commission to redefine broadband high-speed access as a basic service and then to ensure that Canadians with disabilities have opportunities to basic communications services.", "7216 Our first recommendation is to adopt a National Disability Subsidy Fund, MDSF. Having a disability represents a significant and sometimes insurmountable barrier to employability and earning a living wage. This fact accentuates concerns about affordability of basic services for Canadians with low incomes, as detailed in submissions by various consumer associations with a broad policy mandate who are participating in this proceeding, such as the Affordable Access Coalition and Open Media. ", "7217 Much like all other Canadians, persons with disabilities increasingly rely on broadband internet access via fixed and mobile networks. ", "7218 However, those with relatively severe disabilities have limited ability to pay basic communications services, as do families and caretakers of those with severe disabilities, limiting opportunities for social and economic engagement.", "7219 We have therefore proposed developing a National Disability Subsidy Fund, NDSF. ", "7220 MAC/Access 2020 has designed the proposed NDSF to reduce affordability constraints on access to and use of basic communications services by Canadians with severe or very severe disabilities with very low or no income, as detailed in paragraphs 20 to 23 of our second submission to this proceeding.", "7221 Based on very conservative assumptions and strict means testing benchmarks, ensuring that Canadians with severe and very severe disabilities with limited or no income will have access to basic communications services will cost 150 to 300 million per year. ", "7222 This estimate includes not only fixed broadband access, but also mobile. ", "7223 Obviously, including mobile broadband will mean larger commitments will be required to achieve affordability objective of the Telecommunications Act with respect to Canadians with disabilities.", "7224 However, in this context it is imperative to point out that advanced mobile services offer a new world of access to the outside world and possibilities for social and economic interactions previously unimaginable to persons with disabilities.", "7225 We therefore submit that the benefits of including mobile access, as well as subsidies for devices that persons with disabilities with low incomes require in the basic services framework are likely to outweigh any accounting cost increases to the size of the NDSF associated with including both fixed and mobile broadband access in the basic services framework.", "7226 We submit that our proposal for an NDSF represents a reasonable one for ensuring that, for Canadians with severe and very severe disabilities, affordability does not become a barrier to access and use of information technologies and communications. ", "7227 As a relatively prosperous country with very generous people, we submit that most Canadians would not oppose our modest proposal for an NDSF to be mandated by the Commission and funded by network providers. This is demonstrated by the fact that none of the regulated entities who are parties to this proceeding has submitted any objections to our proposal for an industry funded NDSF on the record of this proceeding. ", "7228 We hope the Commission recognizes that without targeted public support through programs such as the NDSF, there is no chance that market forces are going to be sufficient for ensuring that Canadians with severe disabilities and low incomes can utilize information and communications applications that require broadband internet connectivity. ", "7229 MS. KILPATRICK: Our second recommendation is to mandate that all regulated entities offer at least one basic service package that includes minimum service guarantees at a reasonable price.", "7230 Canadians with disabilities employ telecommunications services in a variety of ways that are similar to other Canadians, but also with special needs that depend on the nature of their disability. I can give you examples later in the questions, if you want, that I use.", "7231 Over the last decade, a wide range of internet applications have evolved that can enhance the quality of life and opportunities for persons with various types of disability. ", "7232 Oh, sorry, that's when technology. ", "7233 Unfortunately, the range of fixed and mobile broadband services on offer are not sufficient to meet our growing demand for these applications. The ability of Canadians with disabilities to deploy these enabling applications depends on the availability of fixed and mobile broadband networks that are able to deliver high-speed and symmetric connections with minimum service quality guarantees. Besides general purpose and specific applications designed for people with disabilities, there is a wide range of healthcare and other support mechanisms that require basic internet connectivity. These technologies have the potential to enable many of our stakeholders to live more independently and to engage in social and economic activities. ", "7234 Unfortunately, service providers in Canada only offer retail internet access services in the retail markets only on a \u201cbest effort\u201d basis, i.e. \u201cup to X mbps\". This is not good enough for the basic communications needs of Canadians with disabilities.", "7235 Consequently, MAC/Access 2020 Coalition recommends the Commission should mandate operators to offer at least one basic subscription package that offers service quality guarantees to end users whose particular needs require it. ", "7236 As we detailed in our first submission, this standard-based solution would minimize the potential for interference with market forces as the operators would be able to offer what \u201cbest effort\u201d packages they want in addition to the basic service package the Commission mandates. ", "7237 MAC/Access 2020 Coalition understands that the average user may not demand minimum service quality guarantees or symmetric speeds on fixed and mobile networks and might be satisfied with \u201cbest effort\u201d service packages and uncertain levels of service currently available. ", "7238 However, a wide range of advanced educational, assistive, and otherwise enabling applications that would improve the lives of our stakeholders require minimum basic service quality guarantees for their reliable and safe utilization. ", "7239 In our first submission, we conjectured that large service providers all have the technical capacity to use advanced network control technologies to deliver a basic service package that includes minimum service quality guarantees and meets the minimum service standards required by our stakeholders. ", "7240 This conjecture has now been confirmed on the record of this proceeding in responses by large operators to interrogatories by OpenMedia regarding their ability to deliver minimum service quality guarantees to end users. ", "7241 Most of the large incumbent acknowledge that they have the technical capacity of delivering such guarantees and, in fact, many do so on demand for large customers for a price. ", "7242 However, the operators argue that they do not offer such guarantees to individuals and small-and-medium-sized businesses because of a purported lack of demand. ", "7243 Importantly, operators do not provide any evidence on the record that supports their intention about a lack of demand for service packages that include guarantees of minimum service quality operators actually deliver, versus their \u201cbest efforts\u201d. ", "7244 The case of Canadians with disabilities and our needs for more symmetric and reliable basic service standards, both at home and via mobile networks, contradicts the assertion by some parties that there is no demand for them to commit to some minimum service level standards to their customers.", "7245 Our proposal for addressing service quality concerns of Canadians with disabilities by extending the range of available service profiles to include one or more that include minimum service quality guarantees would not only be critical for the ability of our stakeholders to deploy internet applications they need, but should be beneficial for all consumers deploying applications that need sustained speeds and increasingly reliable and symmetric broadband connections. ", "7246 It is important to note that the report published by the CRTC using the SamKnows test just before this hearing is perfectly consistent with our call for the adoption of minimum service quality standards to regulated entities providers guarantee. ", "7247 Our proposal in this respect is very much analogous to the approach the Commission has adopted with respect to the adoption of the skinny basic TV package in terms of broadcasting.", "7248 MR. TIBBS: Just to conclude, our third recommendation is to institute a disability rights office, or DRO, at the CRTC.", "7249 A key barrier to the ability of Canadians with disabilities to access basic communication services is limited capacity of the service providers to communicate with our stakeholders in the absence of an independent body that facilitates communications and helps mediate disputes between Canadians with disabilities and their service providers.", "7250 As detailed in our recent appearance before the Commission in the review of the structure and mandate of the CCTS, our stakeholders are of the strong opinion that establishing a DRO at the CRTC is necessary for bridging divides in customer service departments of operators and resolving disputes regarding accessibility issues among operators and consumers with disabilities.", "7251 Due to demand by our stakeholders and the lack of other viable options, MAC has been engaged in trying to fill this gap. However, due to the magnitude of the problem this is not sufficient.", "7252 We were, therefore, particularly disappointed that the Commission did not address our proposal for establishing a DRO in its CCTS decision, nor indicate if it is willing to initiate another proceeding to look at this important aspect.", "7253 We have elaborated in our reasons for proposing establishing a DRO in our written submissions and hope the Commission uses the opportunity of this proceeding to address this important gap in access to basic communications services for Canadians with disabilities.", "7254 We urge the Commission to consider the needs of the nearly four million Canadians who have a disability that limits their opportunities for social and economic participation, access to basic communication technologies that enable us to overcome these barriers.", "7255 We submit that policies we have recommended to serve the interests of Canadians with disabilities in accessing basic communications services are likely to benefit all Canadians, as well as potentially service providers that choose to invest in delivering higher quality and more affordable services to our stakeholders. ", "7256 We would be pleased to answer your questions and elaborate on our proposals at this time.", "7257 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. I\u2019ll put you in the hands of vice-chair Menzies. ", "7258 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. ", "7259 A few questions. I\u2019ll just start with a couple of things that caught my eye when reading your submissions. ", "7260 In your first intervention, in paragraph 23, you said there are no operators in the Canadian market that are willing to guarantee a pre-specified level of service/quality speeds to retail customers.", "7261 Can you just tell me how you came to that conclusion? Because it seems to me that it would be a competitive advantage for companies to offer that. ", "7262 MR. TIBBS: Unless somebody has something to add, to the best of our knowledge, and this has been confirmed with the submissions that have come in afterwards, it appears that there are some providers that do offer that to large-scale customers but not in the retail market. And so far I\u2019m not aware of any information to the contrary. ", "7263 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So it was just a scan of what you could see on the ---", "7264 MR. TIBBS: Yeah.", "7265 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- retail offerings? Okay, thank you.", "7266 You speak about the need for synchronicity between download and upload speeds. Can you just help us understand why that -- that\u2019s reasonably unique in the submissions we\u2019ve seen. Why is that of particular importance to the communities you represent?", "7267 MR. TIBBS: Thank you for the question.", "7268 I think there are many examples. But the one that\u2019s foremost in my mind right now is video relay services because it\u2019s a two-way video conversation. And so both the upload and the download need to be symmetric so that the person signing and the person doing interpretation is symmetrical.", "7269 MS. KILPATRICK: Can I just add that I used an app which helps blind people when they\u2019re out if they -- well, it could be in their house too. It\u2019s like a video call, where the person on the other end is sighted, and they actually tell me to point my camera a certain way. I used it this weekend to get out of a big construction site that I found myself in. ", "7270 So again, they need to see my phone and I need to hear them and talk to them over the video call to get the right information that I need. So I could see that being a reason as well. ", "7271 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Can you just clarify; I was distracted for a minute. Did you say that was an app you used?", "7272 MS. KILPATRICK: Yes. Yes, I use many apps for my accessibility. Including that one which is helping you identify objects, as well as reading ingredients on packages, cooking instructions, things like that. I use it for OCR, reading documents, also navigational apps. There are many, many apps I use which make the phone so much more than a frill. ", "7273 And I also have it -- I was reading this morning with it paired with my brail display as well. So I use it all the time to enhance my life. And that one app is called \u201cBe my Eyes\u201d and it\u2019s one of the apps that really helps enhance independence if you\u2019re blind.", "7274 I also want to just point out that deaf-blind people would be using maybe brail displays paired with phone, and that\u2019s an essential communication tool for them.", "7275 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Are those apps available for free?", "7276 MS. KILPATRICK: Many of them are free. By my Eyes is free, I believe. And also, sighted people volunteer to assist blind people with that one.", "7277 There are apps, some of the reading apps, OCR, that cost a fair bit. A lot of them don\u2019t cost very much. Some of my colour identifier apps and my GPS apps was about $29, I think. But many of the apps are free or very minimal cost. So and they\u2019re coming out with more all the time.", "7278 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. ", "7279 In terms of what we\u2019re looking at here is basic service. I\u2019m trying to get a better handle on when it comes to the technical requirements outside of your issue about synchronicity of download and upload speeds. Where are there significant variances between what would be the basic needs of your communities versus the basic needs of broader communities; what specifics do we need to consider? ", "7280 MS. ALPHONSE: I think what you have to realize is that the people we represent are not -- they\u2019re not using internet and phones to -- as an augmentation of communication. It is their form of communication.", "7281 For example, one of the women I know, and I\u2019ve known her for years, grew up with her, and she is non-verbal. She uses a computer attached to her wheelchair that is attached to a desktop on her desk. For example, Bell provided her service but told her she had to get a landline phone and the internet service. She could not get just internet service. And when her internet does not work, she cannot talk. And it is -- it\u2019s that stark a situation.", "7282 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. So ---", "7283 MR. BIRCH: I --", "7284 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Go ahead.", "7285 MR. BIRCH: -- I also think that a lot of it has to do with not just the average speed, but it\u2019s a guarantee of a certain quality of speed that has to be there. Because these aren\u2019t just -- in many cases it\u2019s not just nice, it\u2019s absolutely critical. So like if you\u2019re in a household that\u2019s perhaps getting a certain service but it -- there\u2019s a number of people using it, then the person who is say deaf and is trying to use VRS must have that level of quality of service or they\u2019re not able to communicate. And at times it can come down not -- not to just the ability to communicate, but it could have to do with safety and et cetera. ", "7286 So it\u2019s the guarantee that those minimum services at all times.", "7287 MR. TIBBS: And this ties back to a question that was asked by the Panel earlier today about data caps and whether people in the community could be conscious of that and rely on public Wi-Fi or -- and the like that may be available when you\u2019re out and about. Their services in particular are generally incapable of guaranteeing any sort of quality of service, and if they\u2019re highly congested, things like video relay in particular may just be totally impossible.", "7288 So while there are public Wi-Fi spots, the quality of service you\u2019re going to get there is probably even lower than what you can get off the cellular network.", "7289 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. But in terms of speeds, the 5 and 5 you mentioned and 10 and 10, those are numbers that we could take to the bank as -- in terms of targets?", "7290 MR. TIBBS: Yes, those are -- yeah.", "7291 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So consistently delivered, those sorts of speeds you\u2019re confident meet the needs of your communities. Okay.", "7292 In terms of that, are you -- do you concede at any point that there might be times when usage -- times of day when there\u2019s usage where capacity is more challenged? It\u2019s mentioned last week, you know, similar to if you look -- if you compare it to public utilities, for instance, some folks, you know, you don\u2019t put the dishwasher on until after 8:00 because you\u2019re going to consume less power or you\u2019re going to pay less and that\u2019s just so you -- that people should consider managing their way through the day in terms of that? And understanding that from time to time outages, as with all things, whether it\u2019s power or internet, do occur?", "7293 MR. BIRCH: Yeah, I think I understand your question. And I suppose it\u2019s possible like all consumers that to some extent because you\u2019re right, at certain times of the day the speed, at least in my experience, deteriorates significantly. But, you know, again, I go back to the example, there\u2019s many others, of video relay service because it\u2019s kind of the -- one of the most dramatic ones right now. I mean, if you need to communicate and it\u2019s 6:00 at night and it\u2019s important, then you don\u2019t have the luxury of putting that off.", "7294 So I guess there are ways of, you know, if you have the ability to put a conversation off to later in the day or earlier in the morning, possibly that, you know, we can try to work with that. But I mean, there\u2019s going to be times where that\u2019s not an option.", "7295 MR. RAJABIUN: Okay. There was a -- I\u2019ll connect the two issues that you raised about the 5 and 5 and 10 and 10, the speeds and ability -- and congestion emergence and the development of the new technologies that we mentioned that have already been adopted by most of the large operators that allow them to depreciate service quality on a customer -- individual customer and even individual application level basis. And that allows them to guarantee a certain minimum level of service, even in congestion periods, for particular customers if they want to offer that level of service. And pretty much all of them have now confirmed that they have that capacity.", "7296 I understand if some of the smaller operators may not be able to deliver that minimum service quality guarantees, but larger ones in Canada definitely can do it. ", "7297 And there is new technologies, for example, software defined networking that are emerging that allow each application service quality to be guaranteed regardless of the congestion at that particular point of time. So they have to basically segment a certain part of the network for customers that are demanding service quality, minimum service quality guarantees.", "7298 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.", "7299 How are the basic affordability needs of the communities, people within the communities you represent with low income different from the basic affordability needs for other low income Canadians?", "7300 MR. TIBBS: In a lot of cases, these technologies, when they\u2019re being used as a core means of communication and connectivity to the outside world, be that somebody who is deaf or non-verbal or what have you, it becomes a far more critical component that is less of a want and more of a need. And when we get to service providers who, for example, you know, the cheapest plan that has any amount of data on it might be $60, even though they don\u2019t need a lot of the other features that come with that, but that data plan is the critical part. And they\u2019re going to have to pay the $60. ", "7301 For a lot of other Canadians who have low income, they may need a phone, they may need some connectivity, but there may be other ways around it. But in this case, it\u2019s a fundamental -- for many people with disabilities, this is a fundamental tool that\u2019s needed for every aspect of their life. It\u2019s not, as somebody else mentioned before, it\u2019s not augmenting what is already available in other ways. It may be the only way.", "7302 MS. KILPATRICK: I\u2019ve been hearing very interesting things recently about the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d and of someone using an Amazon Echo who was a quadriplegic and was using -- had programmed his Amazon Echo so it\u2019s all voice recognition to help him turn on lights and off and turn up and down his thermostat. And to me that seems, you know, your average Canadian would take for granted that they could just do those things, but he wasn\u2019t able to do those things before he had technology.", "7303 So again, I think it\u2019s more than just oh something that would be good to have, it\u2019s something that enhances independence to people with disabilities, and also helps them to find work. ", "7304 Often your computers are set up specifically for you. You might not be able to use a computer in a library because the technologies are set up such that you can use your specific computer, as Laurie mentioned about her friend. And in order to get work and to find work, you have to do that through your system. So I think it even helps you to get work to do all your activities of daily living.", "7305 So I think it\u2019s quite different need than average, you know, just Canadians. I mean, we all need it, but this is -- to me it look on it\u2019s more a necessity of life.", "7306 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you. That sort of brings us to your national disability subsidy fund.", "7307 In terms of its structure and you\u2019ve mentioned that it would be rigorously managed, but I\u2019m unclear on a few things. Like how would you manage qualification standards? Would anyone who self-identified as disabled qualify?", "7308 MR. RAJABIUN: The way that the subsidy fund is designed it\u2019s targeting severe and very severe -- people with severe and very severe disabilities with incomes under $15,000 a year, which is the median income for people with severe and very severe disabilities.", "7309 In terms of the distribution of the funds, if you\u2019re asking should they be given to everyone, we haven\u2019t -- I think we sort of touched upon it, but in general, it can be distributed through existing social service agencies so you don\u2019t have to duplicate the administrative burden that's already interacting with people with disabilities, with very severe disabilities.", "7310 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So that was going to be my next point. It was on the 15,000. You mentioned that is a hardline then that it would ---", "7311 MR. RAJABIUN: It's not a hardline. That's just an estimate from the Statistic Canada. This is an overall benchmark baseline. That's the -- for people with very -- for people with mild and not so severe disabilities, the income difference, the median income is pretty close. It's a little less than people without disabilities.", "7312 But for people with severe and very severe disabilities, the median income collapses and is around 15,000 and I think the social services payment varies by province for people with severe disabilities that can\u2019t work but it's generally around 10 to 12,000 maximum.", "7313 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "7314 MR. RAJABIUN: Those are the income benchmarks that you could use but we use the 15,000 because it's a national median rather than looking at specific provinces and start to differentiate it.", "7315 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So you see this as being distributed through social services?", "7316 MR. RAJABIUN: Well, that's one option. We haven\u2019t really discussed this and ---", "7317 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Because they had a concern the other day raised with another group was whether or not a subsidy that went through -- that went to people receiving social services might not be clawed back by social services in terms of that or simply absorbed by social services in a follow-through in the scenario you represented.", "7318 Have you had any contact with social service agencies regarding how they might view this proposal?", "7319 MS. ALPHONSE: Not as of yet I don\u2019t think but the thing you have to realize is that there are mechanisms to allow for social service agencies to come on board with a proposal like this.", "7320 One very recent example is the RDSP because originally when the federal government suggested it, they had to go to every social service agency and the provinces had to sign on to the fact that they wouldn\u2019t claw it back. And I don\u2019t believe that any social service agency, provincial provider of social services would look at this as an increase in income.", "7321 And the reason I say that is because many social service providers are in the position of having to subsidize communication aids themselves. So if you're going to suggest a national model for this, I cannot see in my 25 years of working within the system that they would look unfavourably on a proposal such as this.", "7322 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "7323 Going back just on the NDSF for a minute, would it be subsidizing the full cost of internet or just upgraded speeds and data that would be specifically required by members of your communities?", "7324 MR. RAJABIUN: Well, those are -- the estimates you see, they don\u2019t go into that much detail. The estimate of 150 to 300 that you have, that is basically based on $50 -- it would be half a subsidy of $25 a month for the 150 million estimate, and full subsidy of $50 a month for the full 300 million. That does not -- and I think there must have been some typo. That does not include mobile obviously. That only includes fixed because the market prices or at least revenues across different speed tiers have pretty much converged to $50 a month according to CRTC statistics. So that's the baseline they're using for that.", "7325 So if you want to give $25 a month to the -- oh, another estimate that's also important is that we are assuming a take-up ratio of only half of the people with severe and very severe disabilities. That would be incomes below $15,000 a year that would be eligible for it. So we are assuming that half of the people that could technically be eligible for it would not be able to take it up. So that's another angle in that estimate.", "7326 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "7327 Just to switch for a second, if your proposal was accepted and mandated, eventually would it still make sense to continue to subsidize and mandate plain old telephone service as we have because once internet connectivity is established, then VoIP and TRS are options? Do you have a view on that?", "7328 You don\u2019t have to. You can say no.", "7329 MR. RAJABIUN: Well, just a quick note, make sure the internet is there before you get rid of the ---", "7330 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, I think I was going ---", "7331 MR. BIRCH: I think that was a good point going through my head too is just, yeah, I think that makes logical sense as long as it's reliable and always there and then those other things will no longer be used.", "7332 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks.", "7333 MS. KILPATRICK: I say yes. If you think about the age demographics, some seniors -- some seniors are really using a lot of technologies and internet. There are a few still who may be relying mostly on our landline phones but I think once it's all set up within the next, I don\u2019t know, 10 years, 5 to 10 years, maybe not, because most people are using mobile technologies, internet. It's easier for me now. I used to use the subsidized 411 for looking up phone numbers but I don\u2019t remember when the last time was that I went there because I just do it on the internet now because it's easier for me to do. So I think maybe the time is coming for that.", "7334 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "7335 So back to the NDSF, where would the money come from, 150 million to $300 million? Like we don\u2019t have any. We just have ways to access other people\u2019s money. So whose other people\u2019s money would you like us to go get and how?", "7336 MS. MARTIN: It would be funded by the service providers.", "7337 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Do you not think that might not have an impact on other -- would it be funded through the service providers by say a fee on people\u2019s internet or communications bills, or where they ---", "7338 MS. MARTIN: Our request to the Commission is to mandate the service providers to provide a subsidy to those with severe disabilities.", "7339 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. You envision them doing that without passing that cap cost along to their customers?", "7340 MR. BIRCH: I always assumed that it would have to be built into their business model in some way. But they in turn would be getting that revenue back as well because when they provide the service, they\u2019d actually get the money back as well.", "7341 But yes, it would have to come from either a special levy on their bill or funded in some way that I'm sure will get transferred to the other consumers using the service as well.", "7342 MR. RAJABIUN: If I may on that, I think this goes back to a discussion we had a few days ago. It's crossing between short term and long term in the -- be sort of have a structure of these proposals. They're a win-win. So they actually -- they would increase revenues and demand by the disabilities communities for service providers. So they could have a positive revenue impact in the longer term.", "7343 The problem is in the shorter term how you finance these kinds of programs that try to close affordability and quality gaps and improve digital inclusion, which could come just -- could be built, could be off-the-shelf financing, or could be in the bills of customers, as you heard from the -- some of the estimates that -- surveys that the Affordable Access Coalition did, the willingness to pay by Canadians for rural communities. ", "7344 They didn\u2019t ask about disabilities communities, but that's an interesting question that they could ask and try to figure out what would be the willingness to pay $1 more a month or $2 more a month. ", "7345 But in general, that's just short-term financing, so the benefits at the end, it's either -- I would say it's not -- at the minimum, it's revenue neutral, our proposal to the service providers. ", "7346 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: They pay in and the money flows back to them? ", "7347 Okay, I'm still concerned. I mean, I want you to help me out with this concern regarding the end of the day impact on the average person's internet bill or communications costs. ", "7348 So in the discussion last week, which you were not at all responsible for, but the indication was that we were talking about $1.70 a month on people's bills. The fund was about the same size, and if I were to assume that this is another $1.70 that flows through -- and we're only five days into the hearing and there's other proposals, perhaps, to come -- I'm just wondering where this all goes and if there isn't some way to coordinate some of these ideals, because if -- you know what I mean? ", "7349 I mean, like, I don't doubt your statement that Canadians are generous people and they want to help. But if we were to come out of here saying, \"Okay, folks, your internet bill's going to go up $5 or $6 a month by the time all is said and done,\" I'm not sure, for example, how well that might be received in let's say, Newfoundland, where, you know, the average family took a $3,000 hit on their net income last week. ", "7350 So how can we rationalize some of these requests and needs and communicate them to the broader public? ", "7351 MR. TIBBS: I'm not sure of the specifics of the other requests that have been made, but I know in a presentation earlier today it was mentioned that perhaps, in terms of video relay, you know, there may be a levy to fund -- to provide funding for that. ", "7352 But some of these proposals are at least overlapping in terms of their outcome. You know, guaranteed minimum service levels or bandwidth for video relay services would -- encompasses some of what we're looking at. Now, I don't know what the other specific proposals are, if anybody else does, in terms of their overlap, but hopefully, some of these things will get to the same end. ", "7353 MR. RAJABIUN: The case of overlap, as you see, persons with disabilities have very low incomes, so an affordability fund could touch -- a general affordability fund could touch people with disabilities, but the question becomes targeting and priorities, which the Commission must set. ", "7354 And also, there's a trade-off with the rural funding request, and systems to be developed that have been proposed, various ones in this procedure -- proceedings.", "7355 So I guess it becomes a difficult question of balancing different interests for you. ", "7356 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Would your fund differentiate between rural and -- rural/remote and urban? No? ", "7357 MR. RAJABIUN: No. ", "7358 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks. ", "7359 Just to touch on your DRO request, when last we met, there was some -- I'm not sure how well-founded it was on my part -- but hope that communications on a lot of these issues between your communities and service providers might open up and improve. So how's it going? ", "7360 MR. BIRCH: I don't think I'm aware of any substantial improvement since the last time we met, if that is --- ", "7361 MS. ALPHONSE: I would have to say it has gotten worse. ", "7362 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No fresh dialogue? ", "7363 MS. ALPHONSE: Not on our end.", "7364 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "7365 I'm going to ask you a question that I asked the group last week, because I think it's reasonably important. ", "7366 When we have these asks regarding -- and this is not to disrespect the need and the -- or the ask in any way -- but I asked this of ACORN, I believe. ", "7367 With regards to people who are on Social Assistance -- and you\u2019ve highlighted that, in terms of for your fund -- there are 10 provincial governments and three territorial governments who are responsible for Social Services. And they are comprised of thousands of elected officials, advised by tens of thousands of social workers and child welfare workers and child care workers, and not one of them that I'm aware of -- or that has been brought to our attention here at least -- has chosen to define internet access or communications at specs as fundamental to a person's needs and to therefore fund it as part of their basic package.", "7368 So -- and I'm unaware of this being a matter of vigorous debate in Parliament either, for that matter, so why would we, with no expertise in social work or child welfare work and that sort of stuff, not take their position -- how they came to it is their business -- as advice on this and say that, no, this is not a basic need, that if the people responsible for Social Services have chosen not to fund it, why would we?", "7369 MS. ALPHONSE: I would have to say, sir, because I am aware of the fact that while they don\u2019t fund it across the board, for people who are severely disabled and need augmentative communication aids, they do fund some of those costs. ", "7370 How particularly it flows for individuals is done on an individual basis. To answer your question as to why we think it should come from the CRTC, is because it would make it easier for people with disabilities to get the materials and the services they need. ", "7371 Because right now, you're right, it is not done across the board and when people have augmentative communication needs, it has to be argued on a individual basis and if you do not have the skills required for argument, which many of these folks do not, they end up coming to organizations like mine, the Disabled Women's Network, for assistance in forming those arguments.", "7372 We are just suggesting that we take the need for argument out of the scenario, because we already recognize it as a need. ", "7373 MS. KILPATRICK: Can I just bring out too that I think a lot of education is needed to the general public and to organizations all the time about what technology does for people with disabilities. ", "7374 I work in the field of training people who are blind -- deaf, blind, no vision, with technologies, and I have to keep up on it all the time. ", "7375 But I do feel that so many times in the public I'm out and people don\u2019t realize what I -- what you can use technology for, what you can use internet for, and perhaps the disability community needs to continue to educate service providers, internet providers, everybody about what the importance of technology. And because that\u2019s changing so much and so fast, the education needs to be an ongoing thing.", "7376 So I think sometimes they don\u2019t realize the importance of it, which might be why they haven\u2019t lobbied towards that. Because unless you know and until you know a lot of people using it, you probably don\u2019t always know and it\u2019s changing all the time and evolving.", "7377 MR. MARTIN: I wanted to add to that that the reason you\u2019re not hearing this from Social Services is because this is not a Social Services issue. This is the stakeholders in the MAC/Access 2020 Group are in fact the consumers, the individuals who are using the services provided to improve their means to communicate and to have independence in the outside world.", "7378 We\u2019re looking at a relationship between the consumers and the service providers who come under your mandate to provide the services to help them individually.", "7379 MR. RAJABIUN: I may expand on that. The Social Services angle comes in only in the subsidy mechanism because we are ---", "7380 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, I wanted to clarify that that was the context. ", "7381 MR. RAJABIUN: Yes. No, there is no -- we are consumers and most of the community works as hard as everybody else and pays their taxes. So the quality of service guarantees and the disabilities rights office are a general purpose for whether you are poor or you\u2019re not. Its general purpose that because you are disabled and you have special needs.", "7382 The subsidy mechanism is separate under Social Services. It only came out because you asked about the distribution, how you want to distribute the funds. And we are targeting it only to very low-income persons with severe disabilities who are likely to be receiving social services. So it\u2019s a distribution mechanism so it has nothing to do with other issues.", "7383 And a second more general response to your question, is that telecommunications is federally regulated so provinces can\u2019t really mandate minimum service quality guarantees. Federal government could absolve itself of the responsibility and decentralize regulatory authority, but that\u2019s not where we are right now so I guess it becomes a question of Canada\u2019s constitutional arrangements. ", "7384 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, yeah. It could a false concern. I just do have a little bit of a concern from the discussion the other day that a subsidy would go and be counted, might be counted as income. And at the end of the day the folks who -- if there was such a thing there would be no net benefit. There would just be a lot of money moving around.", "7385 MR. RAJABIUN: If they try to do that, well, shaming them into not doing that.", "7386 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It hasn\u2019t worked so far but there you go.", "7387 MS. ALPHONSE: My experience has been that in those kinds of cases the federal government works to get the provincial subsidy agencies to come on board. There is a model for having that happen.", "7388 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. ", "7389 Those are all my questions. I\u2019ll turn it over to my colleagues, if they have any. Thank you for your interventions. It was very well put together and very professionally presented. Thanks.", "7390 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019ve just polled my colleagues and legal, and apparently we have no further questions for you. But I do thank you for having participated in the proceedings so far. Thank you.", "7391 I believe we have somebody on video conference?", "7392 THE SECRETARY: Yes. We will connect to the Vancouver CRTC office. ", "7393 Welcome. We\u2019ll now hear the presentation of BC Broadband Association. Please introduce yourself and your colleagues, and you have 10 minutes for your presentation. ", "PRESENTATION ", "7394 MR. BOB ALLEN: Thank you. Can everyone hear me okay?", "7395 THE SECRETARY: Yes, you may begin. ", "7396 MR. BOB ALLEN: My audio is working? Great.", "7397 My name is Bob Allen. I\u2019m the President of the B.C. Broadband Association, which is a Western Canadian group of ISPs. I\u2019m also the CEO of ABC Communications, a member of that organization.", "7398 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: And I\u2019m Chris Allen. I\u2019m on the board of directors for the BC Broadband Association, and the President of ABC Communications, an ISP.", "7399 MR. BOB ALLEN: We\u2019d like to begin our presentation by stating that the BC Broadband Association does not support a subsidy mechanism similar to the one in place for voice services to achieve Canada\u2019s goals for broadband connectivity. The B.C. Broadband Association supports the model of targeted government funding supporting market-driven activity.", "7400 A little bit of background on the B.C. Broadband Association. We have most of our members supply internet connectivity in rural communities here in British Columbia. We have 30 service providers in our organization, as well as a number of manufacturers and industry representatives. ", "7401 We provide similar services to our customers across our area, which is basically home internet with voice and some video services. And ABC is the largest member in that group. We\u2019re serving about 3,000 customers, with about 45 employees.", "7402 We think that our service providers are at the leading edge of delivering services, and have participated in numerous rounds of targeted subsidy funding. and have participated in the recent Connecting Canadians Program, which is underway and will run for the next two and a half years or so. ", "7403 And, you know, we target improving service to about 23,000 homes in British Columbia, to bring all those homes up to a five-megabit minimum standard, and in many cases more than that.", "7404 I\u2019m going to let Chris go into some details here on reasons behind our decision to not support a subsidy.", "7405 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: Thanks, guys. ", "7406 Yeah, so as Bob was saying, the BCBA overall supports targeted funding mechanisms versus an ongoing subsidy regime. ", "7407 And I think for one of the first times in any proceeding that I\u2019ve been a party to the -- it\u2019s interesting to see the large incumbents and (inaudible) as well as the smaller ISPs are all generally on the same page on this in not wanting to push into that, the ongoing subsidy type of thing that exists for voice today. And I think that\u2019s worth noting because usually you\u2019ll have a different mindset from the incumbents and the smaller players, but I think it\u2019s interesting to see some harmony in that.", "7408 You know, currently in rural Canada there\u2019s actually a very thriving ISP industry. more so than in a lot of cases in the urban industry, which is often dominated by two large incumbents. There\u2019s literally many hundreds of small internet providers, many small cable co\u2019s, small wireless internet service providers throughout Canada, and it\u2019s encouraging to see that kind of strength in the telecommunication sector in these areas.", "7409 And these kind of operators are investing in facility-based infrastructure, which I know is a stated goal, and have made considerable investments to date in their tower infrastructure and radio equipment and cable plant throughout the country, and have worked hard to try to increase speeds and deliver better services to rural Canadians.", "7410 And today we\u2019re seeing that targeted funding having an effect. As Bob mentioned, the digital Canada 150 Connecting Canadians Program, it\u2019s a huge initiative. I believe it expanded to $500 million, and the first round of it being $305 million. And we were recipients, our company was recipients, as were many member companies of the B.C. Broadband Association.", "7411 And through that, as Bob mentioned, we were able to -- we are in a process right now if rolling out carrier-grade equipment using LTE infrastructure, which will increase speeds well beyond the five megabits per second that the Commission has stated as a goal. ", "7412 And in a lot of cases that kind of capital one-time investment is beyond the capabilities of the small players. So that targeted one-time hit can really help you get up to that level of equipment and service delivery and better coverage. The newer equipment can see more homes, can penetrate through tougher terrain, and improve that service delivery.", "7413 So from our point-of-view, it has been very successful so far, the Digital Canada 150. And even past granting programs, both provincially and federally, that we\u2019ve been involved in have helped us bring service to a lot of areas, that once you get that initial capital investment there is an ongoing business model there that doesn\u2019t need continual kicks-in of more money as an ongoing subsidy kind of regime sort of would have to have. ", "7414 And these kind of investments that we\u2019re making today through the Digital Canada 150 Program, they would be put into a bit of a jeopardy possibly if an ongoing subsidy regime were to be rolled out on top of that money, possibly inciting incenting incumbents to move into our territories in ways that would upset the current market conditions. So I think that\u2019s another point that\u2019s worth making. ", "7415 And ongoing subsidy programs can suffer from a time lag as well in terms of new technologies coming to the table. You know, that time lag could be seen in the fact that I think dialup is probably still an essential service, if I understand correctly. ", "7416 And so, you know, when you\u2019re doing a one-time investment and you\u2019re working with a local player, he\u2019s going to be doing the research to make sure that the best technology is getting put there into that area.", "7417 And on top of that, an ongoing subsidy regime typically has a large amount of overhead from a regulatory overhead point of view. And a lot of the smaller operators, you know, they can be sometimes a three to five-man operation. They don\u2019t have enough kind of office power to really deal with an ongoing subsidy regime, and I think that the overhead for the government and for that small player, it\u2019s not helping anybody in that scenario.", "7418 Today, we have built some great things in our network and our peer companies, we know, have also built some great -- great technology, great service delivery. And all of our ISPs, they live and they work in these communities. They\u2019re providing service to their neighbours. They know what their neighbours are asking them for and what the geographic challenges of the territory are. ", "7419 At a national level, an ongoing subsidy program could upset that by -- again, by pushing incumbents to invest in areas that they\u2019re not maybe as familiar with. And often times, their cost overheads can be higher than smaller players and so the bang for the buck may not be there as well.", "7420 That\u2019s pretty much our point; you know, it\u2019s that we\u2019re -- we have invested to deliver these services into these small areas. We know these areas, and the targeted one-time investments that are going on right now are making a big impact. And the amount of homes that are being brought to a higher level is increasing through this grant program. It would be premature to do anything on top of that without seeing the impact of the DC150 and all the funding that\u2019s being rolled out right now.", "7421 I\u2019ll turn it over to you, Bob.", "7422 MR. BOB ALLEN: Okay, thanks, Chris.", "7423 Those are our key points in -- you know, from our Association and we\u2019d like to keep our presentation fairly succinct.", "7424 Although in closing, I would like to add that coordination and communication within regions is very important.", "7425 In British Columbia, the provincial government has a division that they named Network BC, which listens to complaints from pockets of underserved or lightly served individuals. And as fibre optics are rolled out into the fringe areas of the incumbent providers, there are stranded areas of individuals who are -- their business case becomes stranded because there\u2019s too few of them for a fixed wireless operator to move into. If they don\u2019t have adequate reception for satellite service, they could be stranded permanently.", "7426 And I think that there is a need for -- across the regions of Canada, for organizations like Network BC to work with the public to identify these people who are just necessarily left behind by the evolution of technology.", "7427 You know, we think that there\u2019s -- a very good model has been developed in the rural areas for non-subsidy sustainable business models.", "7428 So when we receive this one-time grant money, yes, that helps us advance more rapidly than we might otherwise advance, but it does not incent us to advance into areas where the operating expenses will put you into a position of permanently losing money.", "7429 So because of that, there are areas where everyone puts their hands up and says, \u201cNo, I just can\u2019t go there. Even if you\u2019d give me money, I can\u2019t sustain the operation.\u201d ", "7430 And I think that, you know, the Commission still has to address and work with the regional organizations to try to find solutions. It\u2019s a rather small number of people, but they are permanently stranded by this evolution.", "7431 And other than that, I would like to thank the Commission for listening to the BC Broadband Association and for conducting this hearing and for all the support they\u2019ve given our Association over the years.", "7432 Thank you very much.", "7433 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "7434 MR. BOB ALLEN: Any questions, of course.", "7435 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Thank you very much, gentlemen.", "7436 So Commissioner Vennard is going to start us with the questions.", "7437 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Hello, gentlemen. I\u2019ll try and keep my questions succinct as well. It\u2019s been a rather long morning and thanks for waiting for us.", "7438 The first question that I have -- I have about three questions for you. The first question that I have relates to essentially what you were just talking about, the stranded groups of people that are not served.", "7439 How does your organization, your Association, go about finding these groups or these people, these communities? Can you give us a little bit of background on that and tell us something about your approach to that, if indeed you do it at all or if that is the function of Network BC?", "7440 MR. BOB ALLEN: Well, were are continuously aware of these individuals. They do clamour for service and they will phone everyone that they think might provide them service, if the incumbents don\u2019t -- aren\u2019t there.", "7441 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "7442 MR. BOB ALLEN: You know, we -- you know, it\u2019s not hard to find your local wireless ISP either.", "7443 And the evolution of satellite technology over the last three or four years has made satellite into a fairly good source of internet access. It\u2019s not as good as terrestrial or fibre optic -- terrestrial wireless, I should say, or fibre optic because of course they deliver very low latency services and can support voice and gaming and high speed interaction.", "7444 But satellite is a pretty good competitor and it has provided an excellent level of service for many Canadians who otherwise would never have been served, even through a subsidy mechanism, unless it was you know massive amounts spent.", "7445 So satellite has to be considered part of the picture for the very thinly spread population, where there just isn\u2019t an economic case for terrestrial wireless and certainly not for fibre optic.", "7446 But of course satellite has its issues as well and particularly in B.C., where we have hills and trees. And not all of the people are actually in a position to receive that. So you can have a shadow of a mountain, which blocks satellite service from reaching those people. They may be out of the economic model for fibre optic deployment, and they may be too thinly dispersed for a fixed wireless operator to go in and service those customers without -- you know, even with the one-time subsidy.", "7447 So there are not a lot of these individuals, but they do need to be identified and the only way those areas -- they\u2019re almost like little black holes in Canada where nobody -- eventually, no one would live there if we don\u2019t do something to do that.", "7448 Now, I don\u2019t think we need a national subsidy mechanism, you know, which would disrupt the current healthy marketplace which has brought broadband service to rural Canada fairly cost-effectively. So that\u2019s where a general subsidy program would not be a healthy thing for the rural consumer.", "7449 But there are these pockets of individuals, and I do think that regional organizations need to identify them. And the Commission should think of perhaps some specialty situation, you know, to deal with folks who are unable to receive satellite service due to terrestrial obstacles.", "7450 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes.", "7451 MR. BOB ALLEN: So that\u2019s just one minor point I\u2019d like to put in there -- to be left at the end of this proceeding.", "7452 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes, we\u2019ve heard from some of those folks that just seem to be sort of falling through the cracks and into these little dark holes.", "7453 Do you think there should be an obligation for the smaller players to serve these people -- or the larger players? What are your thoughts on that? Or are they just sort of, you know, in particular circumstances that are really their own?", "7454 MR. BOB ALLEN: I think sort of the obligation to serve kind of went back when you -- where the entitlement of monopoly brought you the obligation to serve.", "7455 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "7456 MR. BOB ALLEN: And having removed the entitlement of monopoly from our telecommunications system, I think to its vast improvement, you know, we have to sort of drift away from the obligation to serve and move towards the incentive to serve.", "7457 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "7458 MR. BOB ALLEN: And an incentive to serve program, you know, when you have something that where the operating revenues don\u2019t cover the costs, well then an incentive to serve, you know, could be -- could be developed.", "7459 And then perhaps you could have an open tendering process or a -- you know, some sort of process whereby the nearest ISP or the person with the closest facilities is obviously the most likely person to serve those additional subscribers, although they may be doing it at an operating loss.", "7460 And so when you\u2019re into those kinds of situations, then some sort of mechanism that would incent those folks to opt to serve those customers would be -- you know, that would drive them out into those areas. Whereas most ISPs have learned -- because before satellite became an effective competitor, you know, ISPs would go to great lengths to give people service. And they would go out three valleys and four radio shots to get four customers who would pay anything to get internet. ", "7461 But that's all changed with satellite. Those folks were quite happy with satellite, and now you're left with four radio ops and two customers. ", "7462 So those are the kind of situations that the rural operators, you know, don\u2019t want to get involved in. ", "7463 And also, I think that these targeted subsidy programs that help the extension of fibre, when you have someone like a TELUS, who builds a rural fibre plant but concentrates mostly on the denser people, of course, you know, they're open to receiving grants to help and extend their fibre plants another few kilometres to collect a few more customers. And they don\u2019t require an operating subsidy to continue to keep those people running, because they have the bulk of the community as a base for their business model. ", "7464 So I think that there's more dialogue that will come out of this that, you know, we're hopeful that you will choose the, you know, the targeted funding mechanism and not come up with a national subsidy regime, but we do think that there will be a few issues that will require this -- addressing this -- the dark holes and the small pockets of customers that are on (inaudible) to continue to serve, even with a one-time subsidy. ", "7465 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so in your view then --- ", "7466 MR. BOB ALLEN: (Inaudible).", "7467 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: In your view, the competition is working fairly well, in terms of providing infrastructure with targeted -- those funding and private investment? ", "7468 MR. BOB ALLEN: Oh, yes, it's very competitive in rural markets now, and as the ISPs have grown, you know, they begin to compete with each other, so in some cases, in the rural market, you have three competitors --- ", "7469 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "7470 MR. BOB ALLEN: --- already in the market. You have satellite and possibly two wireless internet providers, you have TELUS or the incumbents with their mobile service, where they do deliver increasingly better data packages over the mobile networks. ", "7471 So you know, competition is lively. It's not a slam dunk any more in the rural markets. ", "7472 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: I can say for our packages have consistently gone down, offered more data, and a lower monthly rate year over year for the last 15 years, basically, as the markets have added more competition and technologies and become more economically viable.", "7473 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "7474 Okay, I'm just-- this question is -- I'm referring to paragraph 24 of your intervention. Your comment that you're not in favour of increasing the five-one, are -- does that mean that you are -- you oppose it or is that you simply don\u2019t see a need for it? ", "7475 MR. BOB ALLEN: Well, we think that five-one -- when we offer services out to our customers, so we'll offer speeds up to 10 megabit into markets currently; that's our current level, and we can move to 25. We're preparing ourselves to move to 25, but people generally are not that interested in buying the 10 megabit packages over the 5 megabit packages, and if they do so, it's only because it includes more data, that they can generally -- generally, rural customers are -- if they can receive the full true five megabit performance, they're reasonably happy with those amounts.", "7476 Now, I think that the market will push those speeds up beyond the five and one, and again, as we are in the middle of a very expensive program that all --we're all working very hard on to get to five-one, it would be very disruptive for you to change that target speed in the middle of that program. That program ends around 2017, 2018, something like that, so that would be a time range where you might actually then move the speeds up.", "7477 Now, most of the constructors who are constructing are looking over their shoulder at the 25 megabit satellite products that are on the horizon and we'll be having to compete against those 25 megabit products, so 5 meg won't be good enough if you want to remain competitive against the satellite providers. ", "7478 So if you were going to invest in technology, such as we are investing, we invest in LTE, which is actually capable of 100 megabit if we chose to provision it to that level. But the customers' appetite is not that great at this time. ", "7479 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: Yeah, I think it's worth pointing out that I think that at five megabits, I mean, you can stream an HD Netflix, you can have a great videoconferencing conversation with somebody, you know. The five megabits today, anyway, delivers what we need on the internet. ", "7480 You know, in 10 years, maybe we'll be laughing at that number, but today, the things you need to do on the internet you can do, you can do for five, no problem.", "7481 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "7482 I just have a couple of questions for you before turning it over to my colleagues. ", "7483 One of them is, I'm wondering if you would like to comment on the needs of small businesses as compared to households. Do you see them as being quite similar? ", "7484 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: The needs of -- oh, the small business, like service delivery for them? Right. ", "7485 Now, yeah, small businesses do tend to need more bandwidth, often on the upload side more than the download. A lot of businesses now really rely on some sort of an offsite backup type of a scenario for their data, and that's what we see in the market, is that our -- a lot of business packages come with two megabit up rather than the one megabit up. ", "7486 We do sometimes do some custom things for people up to about five megabit up, just to try to help with that upload portion of it. The amount of data, it's surprising, a residential household, often we use a lot more data than your average small business because the amount of video streaming, which is the number one use of data. ", "7487 In a business, it's not there in the way that it is for a family that's watching Netflix every night. ", "7488 So yeah, it's been -- the needs are slightly different in terms of more upload but not in cases -- the data is not as much as you might think for a business.", "7489 Businesses are able to pay a little more to have a bit more of a carrier grade type of infrastructure and are able to -- they want that higher uptime, which is the better equipment can supply.", "7490 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Also, I'm wondering if you would like to comment on if internet applications considers as entertainment, you know, the streaming and so on; should we take those into account when assessing the internet characteristics needed by Canadians? ", "7491 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: I think if you asked the actual citizens, then it is very important to them, especially when you're in a rural area in the winter months. I think at night, there's less things to do and streaming video is very important. ", "7492 Virtually all of our rural customers watch streaming video in some way, with Netflix being the biggest service, obviously, but there's lots of other ones that are coming on the market now. ", "7493 So I think that can be important. It may be a connection to the general popular culture in a bigger way. My -- you know, the share that you watch the same programming and things like that, with your urban friends, so I think it is entertainment, more so than necessity for life, but as our society wants to, you know, be closer on the urban/rural side, all being able to watch the same shows, the local corner store video store doesn\u2019t exist any more in these tiny communities in most cases, so streaming videos is the only way to watch those films.", "7494 So I think it is important to the consumer. ", "7495 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you think it's an essential or just a nice a nice to have? ", "7496 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: I think calling streaming video an essential service may be premature at this point. It is entertainment. It's certainly not needed to live, but when people's internet gets to a level where they can't watch streaming video, we certainly hear about it, and for someone that -- it feels like to them that it was an essential service. ", "7497 MR. BOB ALLEN: I'd like to comment too, though, that, you know, we suffer in British Columbia in our rural areas maintaining our population base because of the trend today to move to a city regardless of the price of housing. ", "7498 And the access to equivalent video collections of information is extremely important to youth, and they do feel disadvantaged, and to them. You know, if you ask youth whether or not access to YouTube is an essential service, they would probably say yes.", "7499 And is culture an essential thing, you know, so I -- while it's not pure entertainment when it comes to maintaining rural populations. I think it's essential to Canada to have a healthy rural population, and making sure that people in rural areas have access to the same entertainment services that the urban people can enjoy, you know, such as gaming or Netflix. While they do seem to be entertainments, they are, in fact, part of balancing our population mix and maintaining our rural health of our populations. ", "7500 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you for that. ", "7501 My final question has to do with choice, and I'd like you to maybe make some comments on the difference between low density rural and remote areas, compared to high density urban areas, in terms of choice, and how to encourage choice in the low density areas.", "7502 Do you think it's working fairly well? You\u2019ve alluded to choice before you said that you said that you think that the market forces are working -- competition seems to be working. ", "7503 Would you like to add anything further to that in terms of important differences that we should be aware of?", "7504 MR. BOB ALLEN: Well, again, as I say, satellite becomes the major competitor for most ISPs in Canada, and the major satellite provider in Canada, Xplornet, also operates six wireless networks because they recognize that fixed wireless networks can deliver more data into concentrated areas and do provide a slightly better consumer experience. ", "7505 So head-to-head, people will choose fixed wireless over satellite, but satellite does provide a good competitive solution and it is broadly available, whereas fixed wireless tends to get poorer and poorer the farther out you go and the speeds go farther away, the incentive to invest in new gear drops away.", "7506 So the satellite guys have really changed the game in the rural markets over the last four years and intend to continue doing so. So that is a good thing, I think, in terms of those markets. ", "7507 And again we also see the incumbents offering more data with their packages. They\u2019re not the kind of data packages that you\u2019d be watching a lot of Netflix on yet on your mobile service, but they do provide a competitive alternative. ", "7508 So an ISP operating in a rural marketplace faces two competitors in most cases. And if it\u2019s a fairly lucrative area, he will see other ISPs moving into that territory. ", "7509 So we certainly see that in our area where the ISPs are somewhat bobbing up in their own community that they started in. They\u2019ve got a business, they\u2019re doing okay and they want to grow and the only way to grow is move into the other guy\u2019s territory --", "7510 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. ", "7511 MR. BOB ALLEN: -- and start competing against him.", "7512 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "7513 MR. BOB ALLEN: Which leads to people trying to improve their services and it\u2019s a better deal for the consumers. ", "7514 So I can\u2019t speak nationally, but I can speak in terms of provincially and in -- and competition is increasing in rural markets, I would say. ", "7515 Would you back me up on that, Chris?", "7516 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: Absolutely. Certainly between satellite from the incumbents, satellite and usually a couple of rural operators and any decent sized rural community often has poor choices, so that\u2019s -- and sometimes even legacy ADSL plant that delivers slightly slower speeds, but it\u2019s out there as a competitor too in some of the rural areas.", "7517 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you. Those are all my questions. ", "7518 THE CHAIRPERSON: Vice-Chair Menzies?", "7519 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I was just trying to get a sense of pricing, in terms of what you consider affordable. You\u2019re website indicates that 5 in 1 is $100 a month for ABC Communications.", "7520 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: Our five -- yes, our 5 in 1 is $79.95 on a one year term. The $99 is our non-contract rate and our 10 megabits package is $99.95 on a one year term.", "7521 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Is that affordable? ", "7522 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: I think what we found -- certainly there\u2019s good uptake on our packages. ", "7523 What we found is that people are -- as they cut the cord more and they\u2019re cancelling other video-streaming services or video services like satellite, for example, in the rural areas, that their overall telecom spend typically was at around $100 a month or $130 a month or something like that and they factored in their internet, and their T.V., and their phone. ", "7524 When the internet can deliver both the voice and the T.V. services they\u2019re okay with paying $100, in that kind of range, 80 to 100 per month.", "7525 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Good. Okay, that makes sense to me. Thank you.", "7526 MR. BOB ALLEN: I\u2019d just like to comment too that in the -- sorry? ", "7527 THE CHAIRPERSON: Go ahead. ", "7528 MR. BOB ALLEN: I just wanted to comment too that service rates in the urban areas are lower than in the rural areas at this time, particularly in the area of the amount of included data. ", "7529 The -- that has been the key differentiator, I think, in rural markets versus urban markets, is -- for many years urban markets data was unlimited. ", "7530 Now recently there have been limitations placed on the urban markets for those packages and peoples\u2019 prices have risen in the urban markets as they -- as people have absorbed those additional bandwidth costs, so that has narrowed the price.", "7531 As well the investments from the connecting Canadians and other -- just the investments of the telecom providers in rural spaces, have enabled them to get, you know, more bandwidth to the customer at a lower price point. ", "7532 I mean there is still the difficult cost of purchasing fibre optic circuits in rural areas, which is quite high.", "7533 And you must recover the cost of those circuits which can be in the $1,500-2,000 a month for the -- for the fibre optic circuit that\u2019s leading to the small town and you must recover those costs. ", "7534 And -- so those are things that tend to drive it up, but we do see that, as Chris mentioned, we include more traffic and our prices have dropped for those speeds. ", "7535 Essentially we\u2019re holding our prices pretty much where they used to be, but including higher speeds and more traffic as time goes on.", "7536 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: Yeah I think the point there being that in the urban markets I think from -- on the incumbents side, we\u2019ve actually seen the price rising up into you know your average package being in the sort of 65 range, where it used to be down in the sort of 40 range a few years ago, whereas in the rural markets we\u2019ve continually lowered our packages. So we\u2019re getting very close to meeting in the middle here somewhere.", "7537 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you for that. ", "7538 So just to follow-up on your notion of stranded households, based on your knowledge of B.C., how many stranded households do you think there are?", "7539 MR. BOB ALLEN: Now I don\u2019t think that we have done a very good job of identifying, you know, these stranded households. ", "7540 You know we\u2019ve identified folks who don\u2019t have terrestrial service and call them unserved, even though they in fact do have satellite service and in many cases are quite happy with it. ", "7541 The methodology, to some degree, of counting the served and unserved has become a little -- a little hazy and that\u2019s why I think that, you know, it\u2019s important for organisations like Network BC to work with the CRTC and take on that mandate, which is very difficult for the CRTC to get out and find these. ", "7542 I mean the government has gone through a great exercise recently of improving the maps of coverage in Canada and a new map was brought out quite recently.", "7543 And for most of Canada you can click on that map and it will tell you who is providing service in that area and in most cases you\u2019ll find a provider, even if it\u2019s satellite provider. ", "7544 So these spots where there in fact is no provider due to satellite shadowing, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been identified.", "7545 And I don\u2019t know that even the satellite companies have identified them, because they\u2019re just a -- it\u2019s kind of a shadowy pattern across the landscape. ", "7546 But, you know, that should be the focus, I think, of the next fact finding exercises, is to identify these stranded areas and those individuals who can neither receive satellite or terrestrial service. ", "7547 Terrestrial service because of economics and the satellite because of a geographic blocking, but I personally couldn\u2019t give you the number of households in B.C. who are suffering from that.", "7548 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: And that may be a -- if anybody had that data it probably -- or any attempt of that data it probably would be Xplornet, from people actually trying to get service and not being able to, but yes, there probably isn\u2019t great data on just what that number is. ", "7549 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay well thank you very much for that. I believe those are our questions. Just checking -- yes, that is the case so thank you very much gentlemen for having participated in our hearing so far. Thank you. ", "7550 MR. CHRIS ALLEN: Thanks for the opportunity. ", "7551 MR. BOB ALLEN: We appreciate it. ", "7552 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "7553 MR. BOB ALLEN: Thanks for working with us. Have a good day.", "7554 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. ", "7555 So we will continue hearing intervenors after the lunch, but as I mentioned earlier, I have a statement to read.", "7556 Those of you who are familiar with CRTC proceedings will appreciate it is unusual for Chairs to make formal remarks beyond those made at the beginning of the oral hearing, but this is an exceptional hearing in many ways. ", "7557 Exceptional in terms of its scope, the level of public participation and the importance broadband will play in Canada\u2019s future economic and social development. ", "7558 So I ask you to pay careful attention to what I\u2019m about to say. The timing of these remarks is key, because it is right before we start hearing from the largest internet service providers, such as TELUS, Bell, Rogers, CCSA, MTS, Cogeco, SaskTel, Shaw, Eastlink, Quebecor and CNOC, so it seems important to take stock at this time.", "7559 Like many things Canadian, my reflections start with the weather. It was a particularly warm and sunny spring weekend in the Ottawa region over the past two days. ", "7560 Although I had to go into the office yesterday afternoon in order to prepare for this week\u2019s hearing, like many others in Southern Canada I embraced the clear blue skies and sunny weather that accompanies this first real spring weekend.", "7561 In this part of the country, winter began late this year and it decided to overstay its welcome.", "7562 Curiously Christmas was green and Easter was white, but we are making progressive advancements to warmer and sunnier days and we are finally putting behind many weeks of winter that seemed, at times, more like 10 years of darkness.", "7563 As I busied myself removing winter protections on plants, bringing out deck furniture and raking up the vestiges of winter I had time to reflect. I\u2019d like to share with you those reflections over the last week and set the course for our conversation over the next two weeks of hearing.", "7564 Overall, in a nutshell, witnesses that appeared so far have agreed to a self-evident truth. Today, in Canada, broadband is vital.", "7565 Dictionaries define \u201cvital\u201d as being essential to life, to the existence of a thing, to the matter at hand, and to success more broadly. ", "7566 So unless you disagree with this conclusion, let us not spend more hearing time on this self-evident truth. We have other more important things to focus on.", "7567 My second reflection relates to what we appear to have heard so far, including this morning, which is particularly striking.", "7568 Individual Canadians came to testify that they did not choose to face life in poverty or challenged by physical or mental disabilities. Yet governments at all levels have chosen to ask these citizens to seek government services through digital platforms. ", "7569 I myself witnessed departments propose cost-saving business cases while I was at Treasury Port Secretariat, premised on shifting citizenship -- citizen engagement from physical offices and telephone contacts to online. This has had consequences.", "7570 Vulnerable individuals burdened by social and economic insecurity came to testify that the calculation for the level of social assistance available from governance does not take into consideration the cost of connectivity that is nevertheless essential to schedule medical appointments, ensure success in school for their children, facilitate searching for a job, and to do many of the online activities many of the rest of us take for granted.", "7571 Officials from Nunavut testified that they do not have the capacity to deal with the unique broadband challenge facing the north. ", "7572 As a result, for instance, broadband capacity used for Government of Nunavut activity during the day lies idle at the end of the business day and cannot be redirected to the general population in the evening. There seems to be no clear way forward.", "7573 The Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation advanced that there should be one point of contact for Arctic broadband policy pointing out that the Canadian governance model is unclear. On broadband matters they have had to deal with the CRTC, CanNor, Infrastructure Canada and the former Industry Canada. ", "7574 In their view, a single federal entity needed to take the lead and coordinate a coherent Arctic broadband strategy to chart a clear way forward. They pointed to a 2012 broadband report of the International Telecommunication Union that identified thinking beyond electoral cycles as a best practice.", "7575 Municipal and other government witnesses, many of them elected officials and therefore very close to the population, shared their frustration of lack of leadership, the lack of coordination and information, and their own lack of capacity to address the broadband needs of their local residents, businesses and institutions -- of their local residents\u2019 businesses and institutions.", "7576 One could not help but be struck by the uneven level of capacity in various regions to tackle these very modern and complex issues. Those that had made investments and advanced projects were also left wondering if they had made the right choices. As a result, there is a distributed patchwork of problems and solutions across the country. ", "7577 Ces repr\u00e9sentants municipaux ont mentionn\u00e9 aussi l\u2019\u00e9cart consid\u00e9rable au chapitre de la couverture mobile sans fil. La couverture universelle qui est disponible dans certaines parties du pays est irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re ou inexistante dans leur r\u00e9gion.

The metrics of success for private companies are at odds sometimes with the deployment of broadband connectivity and meeting the expectations of Canadians in unserved and underserved regions.", "7581 In areas of low population density, the economics of market forces are challenged. Companies are rightly mindful of such things as RPO and dividends and the return to bondholders and shareholder value and the return on investments on projects.", "7582 What was less clear was when and where such public private incentives were required and how they can, in certain circumstances, have unexpected consequences.", "7583 As you can see, the acknowledgement of broadband being vital to economic, social, democratic and cultural success of individuals and collectivities is a given. However, this only brings us so far. Three other questions must be asked.", "7584 First, where are the gaps to access to connectivity? And when I speak of access to connectivity, I think of it through a number of lenses, including geographic access to broadband connectivity; that is, the actual reach of broadband over the entire Canadian territory. Technological attributes of access to broadband connectivity; that is, the kind of characteristics broadband should have in terms of speed and capacity, latency, jitter, et cetera. Economic access to broadband connectivity, including, in its most extreme form, issues of unaffordability. Skill access to broadband connectivity, including issues of digital literacy and the capacity to make informed choices in a complex digital marketplace for the uninformed, the ill-informed or the folks who are simply overwhelmed.", "7585 The second question is, given those gaps, what are the best strategies in order to close or eliminate them? ", "7586 And finally, who is in the best position to implement those strategies? ", "7587 Clearly, the CRTC has work to do under its jurisdiction. This is the purpose of this proceeding. We will consider such things as basic service objectives and the potential use of redefined subsidy mechanisms. ", "7588 But beyond the CRTC, is there a role for others? Government. What level of government? The private sector through pure market forces, or a combination of all or some of these? And how do we bring coherence and coordination to the actions of many?", "7589 This all brings us to the most important question to be asked. Does Canada currently have a national broadband strategy?

Pity.", "7594 There were some proposed for government investments. But who would disagree that just throwing money at a problem, whether in the area of broadcasting, telecom or any other area of private or public endeavour, without a carefully crafted and integrated strategy is like pouring money into sand. It quickly dissipates, provides little real growth or measurable results and is simply not sustainable.", "7595 I note the Telecommunication Act states, and I quote:", "7596 \u201cIt is hereby affirmed that telecommunications performs an essential role in the maintenance of Canada\u2019s identity and sovereignty. And that the Canadian telecommunications policy has as its objectives, among other things, a) to facilitate the orderly development throughout Canada of a telecommunication system that serves to safeguard, enrich and strengthen the social and economic fabric of Canada and its regions; b) to render reliable and affordable telecommunication services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada; and h) to respond to the economic and social requirements of users of telecommunication services.\u201d ", "7597 Nous devons \u00e9galement se rappeler d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui d\u00e9finissent le cadre juridique.

A chance to create together a coherent national broadband strategy through an open and transparent process based on evidence from all Canadians, achieve to the extent possible through consensus, and implement it through shared responsibility. ", "7605 Coordinated strategies can be successful. One need only look back at the work done in the 1990s under the shared action of the CRTC, TELCOs, and Industry Canada then under the leadership of their Deputy Minister the Honourable Kevin Lynch, who went on to be clerk of the Privy Council. ", "7606 As a result, Canada developed a robust converged communication strategy that ensured for instance that a significant number of households in Canada could choose to be served by at least two wired communication service providers, a result envied by many foreign jurisdictions. Canadians benefited greatly from this. ", "7607 Should we wait for others to act, to launch their own consultation? Perhaps. But the speed of the internet is relentless and time is not on our side for long quiet reflection.

To get daffodils and tulips to bloom ahead of my neighbours requires planning.

Planted in pots in late January or February, early enough for them to take root but not too early so they break ground when it is too cold to set them outside. This takes planning.

So I really don\u2019t want to waste the Panel\u2019s time with going over and rereading what I\u2019ve already got, but I\u2019ll just give you some highlights of what\u2019s been going on here.", "7633 We\u2019ve been trying to get a dialogue going, meaningful dialogue going with TELUS for over eight years. And obviously we haven\u2019t gotten any -- we haven\u2019t had any progress with that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re having this discussion. ", "7634 The main situation here is that we are stuck with one option and one option only, and that\u2019s satellite with Xplornet. I\u2019m not complaining about the service for Xplornet but the cost is extremely high, as you\u2019re probably all aware.", "7635 The other aspect of this whole thing, and one of the highlights, is that in trying to get a dialogue going with TELUS asking them to look at and investigate ways of possibly getting high speed to the 60 residences or properties that are on North Pilkey Point Road has also been fruitless for us. ", "7636 The property -- the high-speed connection via TELUS actually ends at a property that\u2019s in walking distance from our home on Pilkey Point Road. We\u2019ve asked them to investigate ways of looking at aspects of the wiring, the upgrading, which they claim is going to cost them $100,000. ", "7637 Having said that, we\u2019re the only area on Thetis Island, the only road that doesn\u2019t have access to high-speed internet service. ", "7638 You know, other aspects of this lack of dialogue with TELUS is the fact that they considered our issue and our complaints closed. They won\u2019t have a dialogue with us anymore and this I've heard from management.", "7639 So the whole communication and relationship between the TELUS Corporation and us here has kind of deteriorated into a moot point, no dialogue in other words. And we're trying to figure out with all this advanced technology and all the other areas that do get high speed service, from fibre optics relay systems, relay stations, we're wondering why this is such a, shall I say, challenging situation to TELUS other than the fact they say it's going to cost them $100,000 which has been questioned by a number of people here.", "7640 I could take your time going through this letter, paragraph and sentence by sentence but I think you already have the crux of what I have said and all the information and all the documentation and prior references to the correspondence over the last eight years, from 2008 to the present.", "7641 So I'm not sure where I should go from here or do you want more information other than what you have in front of you?", "7642 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, what we can do -- this is Jean-Pierre Blais, the Chairperson. What we can do is if you don\u2019t have any other things to say, we can move to asking you some questions.", "7643 MR. FRANKEL: Sure. I mean I could repeat a lot of the stuff. It's just redundant and, as I said, you\u2019ve already got the information in front of you and, as I said, I think it was Jade (ph) before that. It's like a PowerPoint presentation. It's already in front of you. I don\u2019t want to have to read to you folks.", "7644 THE CHAIRPERSON: Fair enough, fair enough.", "7645 MR. FRANKEL: I could read it to you but ---", "7646 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, no, fair enough. We do have it. So maybe what I'll suggest is I'll invite Commissioner MacDonald to ask you some questions.", "7647 MR. FRANKEL: Sure.", "7648 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good day and thank you for joining the proceeding here today.", "7649 I do have a few questions just so I understand the situation on the Island a little bit better.", "7650 MR. FRANKEL: Sure.", "7651 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You said that TELUS is the predominant service provider but that yours is the only street without access to high speed internet. Does TELUS provide high speed to everyone else on the island except your one road?", "7652 MR. FRANKEL: That's right. Now, you can -- as I said, we now -- you know, we have access to satellite which we now have but the cost of satellite and the service of satellite is not the same, as you know, as high-speed service through a telephone company or another company. TELUS is the only phone provider on the island. We don\u2019t have access to Shaw or Rogers here.", "7653 And yet, the only road that doesn\u2019t have high-speed access is North Pilkey Point Road and from our place on, there's about 60 properties that don\u2019t have access to it.", "7654 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And I was on the website and I see there's about 350 full-time residents of the Island.", "7655 MR. FRANKEL: That's right.", "7656 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And you said there's about 60 homes on your street. Are those occupied year round or are they more seasonal properties?", "7657 MR. FRANKEL: No. As a matter of fact, I think I failed to put that in the letter and I apologize but retirees is a large portion of the population and many of those retirees are part-time residents but a lot of the properties on Pilkey Point Road where we are, the 60 properties, they are part-time residents. So yeah, you are right that they come up intermittently or they spend the summers here, spring and summer. It varies.", "7658 During the warmer season, the population can be as high as, oh I don\u2019t know, 11 or 1,200 folks here as it is on most of the Gulf Islands. The spring, summer and fall time, the population increases substantially, but full time, 350.", "7659 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And obviously at one point I know TELUS is telling you today that it will cost about $100,000 to run facilities along the road, which they're citing as the reason as to why they don\u2019t want to do that. But obviously at one time, the rest of the Island was built out for service and I'm looking at a map and Pilkey Point Road doesn\u2019t look to be overly remote in relation to some of the other roads on the Island.", "7660 So do you have any other information as to why that road was left off of an initial build that would have happened some time ago?", "7661 MR. FRANKEL: You know, it's a very, very good question. We have actually asked the technicians and repair folks who have come here and I don\u2019t certainly want to mention a name but the repair staff at TELUS are terrific. They have even said to us, \u201cWe don\u2019t know why this can\u2019t be done. It's not a major technological problem.\u201d", "7662 So we don\u2019t know why it was left off other than their statement to us was, \u201cWell, we're not obligated to provide this service as long as you have options\u201d, and that was a quote from -- \u201cYou know, we have options here. You have Xplornet. You have a device that we can sell you which is a Stick device with an amplifier on it\u201d, which -- and most of the case, it hasn\u2019t worked and proved that it wasn't worthy of purchasing.", "7663 So their response has been, \u201cYou have options. It's going to cost us $100,000.\u201d They're talking about a situation where they have to wire or upgrade the wire to provide high speed and why -- why that's an issue, I can't say other than I think I wrote in that letter and I don\u2019t mean to be spewing my spleen and ranting against TELUS. I mean that hasn't served us any purpose but when we try to have a dialogue, we said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you do this or do this or provide a line\u201d, the last -- one of the last comments to us was, \u201cWe're not in the business to provide charity\u201d.", "7664 So that's kind of that and the situation where they said to us, \u201cThis is a closed complaint as far as we're concerned\u201d, basically car-bust any kind of further communication with the management. But in short answer to you, I don\u2019t know why that in reply anyway they didn't -- you know, that they didn't add that.", "7665 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: To the best of your knowledge, has your Island or TELUS or even the satellite service provider been provided with any federal or provincial funding to support the cost of deploying broadband to the Island residents?", "7666 MR. FRANKEL: It's another very good question. You're real good. I believe that Xplornet was given grants and I think that it has specifically to do with the equipment, you know, i.e. the dish and -- hello?", "7667 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: We're still here.", "7668 MR. FRANKEL: I\u2019m sorry. I believe it has to do with a grant for the dish and the (off mic) but that's a good question because we were wondering, well, if they can -- if they're giving grants to satellite companies, why wouldn\u2019t they give a grant to TELUS to put -- upgrade the wiring? It would probably be a lot -- I don\u2019t know if it would be cheaper, maybe not. I don\u2019t have that information but I don\u2019t know -- I do know the satellite companies are getting grants but as far as I know, TELUS hasn't been given, that we know of, any grants to address this situation.", "7669 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Earlier today we heard from the British Columbia Broadband Association and they indicated that most people in rural areas were quite happy with the current satellite service that they are receiving.", "7670 Would you care to share your thoughts on how pleased you are with the current services, whether it's -- you've mentioned pricing but whether it's actually a stable service for you?", "7671 MR. FRANKEL: Well, the service in general is way better than dial-up. But one the main issues with that is the cost which is considerable. You know, you're looking at for a basic service minimum is a $1,000 a year, especially if you have students at home, students at university or school.", "7672 The other thing is it depends on the -- in rural areas, especially on Gulf Islands, where you are service-wise. So yes, you can get access to things but the service sometimes can be interrupted. I guess any service can be interrupted. You have -- it's not as quick but that's not a major issue.", "7673 There are interruptions, as I said. Sometimes you have to reconnect more than you would with high speed, but overall, I would say it's a good service, way better than what we had, which was nothing. ", "7674 So the only thing I can compare it to, really, is dial-up service, and in that regards, you know, it's way better, except for the cost. ", "7675 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Your thoughts on the cost and what the pricing should be, if -- Xplornet was in here last week and they were talking about new services they're going to be launching that are at higher speeds than they're currently able to provide. ", "7676 Do you feel that if you were getting more speed and more bandwidth that the price you're paying may be justified? ", "7677 MR. FRANKEL: You know, I guess there's a fine line of -- and that's, I guess, a very personal preference to what your needs are, as a family, individually. Our needs are not that great, as far as -- we're both retired. Our son, yes, is in university, but he's back and forth, so how much you want and how much you need is, you know, it varies from place to place, and how much you're willing to pay for that also varies.", "7678 I mean, we're not -- we realize this is a costly operation, but there's also a fine line that we'd be willing to go over for this kind of service.", "7679 Now, I'm sure other people will be willing to pay more, pay -- you know, pay what they're paying for improved service before it gets to a point where you say, \"Well, how much do we continue to pay no matter what you're getting?\"", "7680 So in my mind -- I mean, if this is all we could get and the cost was more reasonable, so be it. We'd be fine with that.", "7681 COMMISISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that. Just one final question before I --- ", "7682 MR. FRANKEL: Sure.", "7683 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- hand you back over to my colleagues.", "7684 MR. FRANKEL: M'hm. ", "7685 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: If the cost is in around $100,000 to deliver improved services to your street, what's your opinion on whose responsibility it should be to pay for that? Should it be from a taxpayer revenue in the form of a targeted government grant to build out service? Should it be financed through general revenues from your service provider, TELUS? Or should we perhaps look to all Canadians to kick in a couple of bucks on their monthly bills to help fund some of these more rural bills?", "7686 Do you have any thoughts on that?", "7687 MR. FRANKEL: Sure. Canadians would love that, but I guess it depends on your politics. You know, personally speaking, and I know you could be cheeky about that, but I believe -- and I'm speaking for myself, not to anyone else, and my wife, too -- that there are certain essential services, and communication is an essential service like fire response, medical, education. You know, it's -- I mean, in this world today, you can't live without the technology. ", "7688 And it's such an essential service, I think that the government should be largely responsible for that. And whether it means grants or increased tax to (inaudible) levelling out the playing field more level, whether you are, you know, living in the boondocks or you're living in Vancouver, Victoria -- and by the way, we used to live -- we were long-term residents at Victoria.", "7689 And I guess you could be saying, \"Well, you know, you guys are the ones who decided to go to the boondocks.\"", "7690 Yeah, that's true, but you know, the boondocks is part of the country, and I think that, you know, whether it's a small population, rural -- in today's world, the 21st century, we should all be connected with the most efficient, you know, best service. ", "7691 But I do believe the government has a large part to play in this, and I guess that's why you guys are involved with the hearings. ", "7692 It's just an aside, interesting. When I started to rant about this eight or nine years ago to the CRTC, the first letter I got back was, \"This isn't under our jurisdiction.\" ", "7693 And that was the end of that until fairly recently, when the CRTC, I guess, decided to get involved with this. That's just an aside, you know?", "7694 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Well, thank you very much again for answering our questions, and being part of this today. I'll hand you back over to the Chairman. ", "7695 MR. FRANKEL: Thank you. ", "7696 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, just looking at my colleagues to see if they had any questions, and apparently you\u2019ve -- we've completed our questions at this point, so I repeat what Commissioner MacDonald said, and thank you for having participated in the hearing, and hope that you continue to follow it and participate in the future (inaudible).", "7697 MR. FRANKEL: I'd be happy to participate in (inaudible) further meetings on this. ", "7698 I also want to thank you for letting me bend your ears there. I know you guys are busy, busy, so thank you for hearing me and all the best with the hearings.", "7699 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you very much, and you're the reason why we do what we do, so we're happy to hear from you. So thank you very much.", "7700 MR. FRANKEL: Thank you very much. ", "7701 THE CHAIRPEROSN: Thank you. ", "7702 Madame la secr\u00e9taire.", "7703 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. We'll now connect to the Vancouver CRTC office. ", "7704 Hi, Mrs. Susan Lowell. How are you? Can you hear us well? ", "7705 MS. LOWELL: I'm good, thank you. ", "7706 THE SECRETARY: Perfect, thank you. ", "7707 MS. LOWELL: Yes, I'm here.", "7708 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. You may begin your presentation. You have five minutes. ", "PRESENTATION ", "7709 MS. LOWELL: Thank you very much, and thank you very much for the opportunity to appear at this important and relevant hearing. ", "7710 I don't want to talk about the necessity of internet. I think you\u2019ve heard enough about that, but I would like to focus my input on how the current system of letting market forces alone dictate who has access to the internet. ", "7711 Effectively, it's created pockets or islands of areas that could conceivably never receive access.", "7712 To participate in this hearing, I have had to travel to Vancouver because I don\u2019t have a fast enough link at my house, either by telephone or by internet, in order to do this. ", "7713 And I am here on my own. I'm not on behalf of any organization. Many of my neighbours do have the same views as I have, so I sort of speak for them, but I'm not here on anybody's behalf. ", "7714 I have also looked at the information that's available on your websites for the -- if areas are supposedly connected to broadband internet as defined, and I can confirm that I located, you know, our street, but our street is not served by broadband, so that's a -- maybe a flaw in the data, I'm not sure.", "7715 I also looked at the map that's available on the Network B.C. Connectivity map, and it also has what I believe is erroneous data. Our household is not connected. ", "7716 And I can speak very authoritatively on that. I did a survey with a neighbour a couple of years ago when TELUS was doing one of their installs, an we identified over 60 households in our neighbourhood as being interested in connecting to a wider service, and we are not available to.", "7717 So just to give you a little bit more, I've included a map in my presentation, which I believe you have before you. And the map shows -- it's just -- it's more of a sketch than a map, but it does show the red line, which is where the wired network works its way along the highway from the -- along the Sunshine Coast area. And the connection stops about two kilometres south of our house and then the wired connections start again about four kilometres north. ", "7718 And if you look at the map, and you can see on the line, it's -- we're not isolated, we're not remote, we're not at the end of a road, we're just an area that's been skipped over by the connection. ", "7719 And I've estimated it and identified by looking at some sources through our municipality, that there's 134 houses along that section of road that are not connected to wires. ", "7720 But -- and I will say that I understand and I fully appreciate that both TELUS and Eastlink, who are the operators in the area, they are for-profit companies, and as such, they can and do choose where they wish to service, and they have criteria on how they want to use their capital and their responsibility to their shareholders is to maximize the return on their capital, so I understand that. ", "7721 And I also agree that the density within our neighbourhood is not high. It's lower than other areas, but it's certainly not the lowest density for areas that either of those companies have provided service. It's the business decisions of both of those companies that resulted in our island being left out as -- we call it an island; one of our neighbours calls it -- he feels like the hole in the donut. ", "7722 But we're left out. We're too small of a market for a third party to enter as a stand-alone, yet deemed too sparse for the incumbents. ", "7723 And so just to add the extra complexity to that, our situation is also affected by the local geography. We're in a forested area. We're on the side of the Coastal Mountain Range, so we're left with the two wireless opportunities. One is the mobile hub or the -- I think the telephone companies call it the mobile internet solution and the other is satellites, which I know has been talked about a lot. And we find ourselves at our particular house in the unenviable position of not being able to site a satellite dish. You have to point the -- as you know, you have to point the satellite dish at the satellite and you can\u2019t see it from our house for to what I\u2019ve described as having to build a 10-metre tower attached to our house or cutting down the trees. And they\u2019re not even our trees that would have to be cut down in order to be able to see the satellite.", "7724 So as I said, we are left with this mobile internet or cellphone technology and that is what we do use. It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s slow, and it\u2019s spotty, and our connection are constantly dropping. Hence why I didn\u2019t want to risk trying to connect into the hearing from my home because I had to -- I wanted to be sure that I wouldn\u2019t lose the signal partway through the conversation.", "7725 We have had many conversations with both of the wired providers and they\u2019re just not able to get past their formula to extend the service into our area.", "7726 And I don\u2019t have the expertise to critique their system designs, but I can say that the distance to the nearest fibre hub where the -- and I know this is TELUS\u2019 hub, is less than 10 kilometres from our house. And it\u2019s measured along the trunk line and the fibre trunk line runs right across the end of our road. So I believe that the technology is not an issue, that the distance is well within the range.", "7727 I also had explored with our municipal representative some opportunities from grants because I do understand there are grants from government agencies. ", "7728 And when looking at our situation as we are actually close to the infrastructure, the -- you know, the line runs past the end of our road or close to a hub, it seems and apparent that the wired service is really the optimal and obvious solution. ", "7729 And there is funding in B.C. available, but from what I understand, that funding can\u2019t be applied to connect us into a TELUS fibre. It\u2019s really aimed at third party providers coming in to bring in -- such as the Broadband B.C. Association companies. But those companies rely on radio signals and you can\u2019t see through the rocks in order to get your radio signal. So the geography plays an important role in our situation.", "7730 And I can\u2019t help but draw back to the parallel with party lines and telephone communication. For years the telephone company said, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to do this. We\u2019ll all go out of business.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t think any of them went out of business when there was intervention from the government and the rural communities now have private telephone lines. So I believe we\u2019re at a similar juncture where there\u2019s some intervention required.", "7731 So just wanted to summarize that the current practice for internet providers is to pick and choose where they wish to service. They focus on high return areas and that effectively creates islands or pockets that are not serviced. There\u2019s no requirement for them to service low return areas. ", "7732 So I think our neighbourhood, for one, has fallen through the cracks and we\u2019ll be left unserviced without some kind of intervention or support from the CRTC or another government agency.", "7733 And the overwhelming response -- I did participate in the survey and I read the results of the survey. And I would say that there was, you know, an overwhelming response to support unserved and rural customers by the rest of Canadians.", "7734 So I just wanted to just raise the point that there are some of us out there that we\u2019re not remote, we\u2019re not far away from anything. We\u2019ve just been bypassed by the current operators.", "7735 Thank you very much.", "7736 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much, Ms. Lowell. Commissioner Vennard will start the questioning.", "7737 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good afternoon. ", "7738 I\u2019m wondering if you can tell me, of the 134 houses, how many of them are unserved and how many are under-served?", "7739 MS. LOWELL: Well, I don\u2019t have the -- I can\u2019t answer that question because, from what I understand, the differentiation would be who has satellite and who doesn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t know that. But none of those 134 are connected to wires. I can say that.", "7740 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: But do they have -- do they have internet?", "7741 MS. LOWELL: I believe they may have satellite internet. They may have the mobile internet hub that we use through the cell phone service.", "7742 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "7743 MS. LOWELL: But they\u2019re not connected to wires.", "7744 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So your main focus is you want to be connected to wires, fibre optic? You don\u2019t want a wireless solution for --", "7745 MS. LOWELL: Well --", "7746 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- your area?", "7747 MS. LOWELL: -- I would love to be connected to the internet with a speed that I could utilize, you know, whether you call it the five megabytes per second. And if we could connect with a satellite easily from our house, we would have done that. I\u2019ve had the satellite technician out four times trying to figure out where we could put up the dish and we just can\u2019t be able to site one. And so our -- the solution that we\u2019re left with is at a much slower speed.", "7748 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: What sort of speed do you think you would need? And I\u2019m presuming you\u2019re speaking for this --", "7749 MS. LOWELL: Well, I think the --", "7750 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- unserved area.", "7751 MS. LOWELL: -- I think the five megabytes would be fine. I mean, if we could get that -- we\u2019re less -- we\u2019re much less than one now and I run those little speed tests quite often. And it\u2019s usually less than one megabyte a second. On occasion it gets up to over two, but I\u2019ve never seen anything higher than that.", "7752 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I\u2019m wondering, do you have people that operate small businesses from their homes and so on in your -- within your unserved area?", "7753 MS. LOWELL: Yes, we do. Yes, we do. We have bed and breakfasts. There\u2019s several of those. There\u2019s a real working facility. I know there\u2019s another gentleman that runs a tour boat and he runs the -- the office is in his house.", "7754 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So the businesses then would be affected by this as well from a digital economy point of view in this area. It\u2019s not just residentials that we\u2019re talking about.", "7755 MS. LOWELL: Yes, I would agree with that. And I would also say that it limits the growth of new businesses, you know, the people that may want to relocate and move to, you know, a nicer, smaller community away from the city. And they couldn\u2019t locate a business in our area because of the connectivity issues.", "7756 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. And it -- so in that sense, it\u2019s limiting in terms of economic development, as well as your residential use and what it -- whatever it is that you would use it for. What sort of applications do you think would be useful, would be used and what sort of speed?", "7757 MS. LOWELL: So could you repeat that question?", "7758 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes, I\u2019m wondering about your perception of the applications and the uses and the speeds that would be required in your area.", "7759 MS. LOWELL: I don\u2019t know I -- that I could specifically say that. I mean, what we like to do is just to be researching options on the internet, like when we\u2019re going on a vacation just, you know, looking to be booking accommodations. I actually, kind of ironically, I tried to do a lot of research for this hearing from my house and I couldn\u2019t do it from my house. I had to go to other people\u2019s homes in order to do it because the bill time on the websites it just couldn\u2019t do it. It just wouldn\u2019t -- it would never bill. So I -- you know, and just basic research like that. It seems to be using it more and more -- requiring higher speeds to just to do anything.", "7760 So I mean, we have -- my kids laugh at me, but we have a no streaming rule in our house because you just can\u2019t stream -- you know, we can watch the odd YouTube vide, but that\u2019s about it. You know, the concept of using it for entertainment are -- is completely off the books in our house.", "7761 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. That was going to be my -- you anticipated my next question was to ask about the value of --", "7762 MS. LOWELL: Oh.", "7763 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- entertainment and how you perceive that within your household and those around you. Is that something that you think of as essential --", "7764 MS. LOWELL: I --", "7765 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- or nice to have or?", "7766 MS. LOWELL: -- I would say that I think entertainment is nice to have. I would have difficulty myself calling it essential. But I do find that I feel like we\u2019re falling behind. And we\u2019re just falling behind and being left out I guess is where I feel that we are. It\u2019s extremely frustrating to know that just a short two kilometres from our house, you know, one of those neighbours has the full fibre optics suite from TELUS.", "7767 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "7768 MS. LOWELL: And it\u2019s just where they, you know, their economic model said they\u2019re going to stop and that\u2019s where they stopped.", "7769 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "7770 MS. LOWELL: And so it\u2019s just that -- there is that degree of frustration. But I would have personally have difficulties calling it an essential service --", "7771 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. What about --", "7772 MS. LOWELL: -- for entertainment.", "7773 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- what about in terms of cost, how much are you paying for your service now?", "7774 MS. LOWELL: Right now we average about $100 a month. And for that $100 a month we get 6 gigabytes of data. If we go over -- I think this 6 or 7 is usually what we use and that costs us $100 a month.", "7775 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "7776 MS. LOWELL: It\u2019s basically the additional data charge is $10 a gigabyte if I wanted to download a big file, et cetera. So for instance, when I bought a new computer I had to set it up online because everything is done online now. I had to take my computer to somebody\u2019s home to do that because I can\u2019t do it from my house. It would just be exorbitantly expensive and chances are the signal would have dropped partway to it, and I would have had to start over anyways. ", "7777 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "7778 What I\u2019m wondering about now is whose responsibility do you think it is to serve your area, to put a service in that suitable -- that\u2019s acceptable to you; whose responsibility do you think that is?", "7779 You mentioned possibly CRTC or some other government agency. Can you maybe just expand on how -- you have a problem obviously and other people in your area. How does that problem get solved? What do you see is a fix for it, a solution?", "7780 MS. LOWELL: I think that it should be a shared responsibility for the solution. I think there could be a role for some government funding, whether it be -- you know, a targeted grant or something to close these gaps.", "7781 I think there could also be some responsibility borne by the companies that provide the services. They -- I mean, their words to me, you know, \u201cWe choose where we spend our capital, and we have chosen not to spend it on your area.\u201d", "7782 So I think they do have choices. I think they -- you know, if they had added our area into a larger net, it could have been averaged in, and I think the cost would have been negligible per household.", "7783 But because they\u2019re now viewing us as a stranded standalone area that doesn\u2019t have service, the cost just sort of go through the roof. And that\u2019s just because of the model that they -- they borne.", "7784 So I do believe it\u2019s a shared responsibility. I\u2019m not sure that it goes all the way to being a subsidy on the internet for every household in Canada to bear the brunt for, you know, rural pockets, but I think it shouldn\u2019t be borne entirely by the rural pockets themselves.", "7785 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: But do you think that -- do you think that you have some responsibility for that as well, to share in that responsibility?", "7786 Because it almost sounds like ---", "7787 MS. LOWELL: Yes ---", "7788 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And I guess I\u2019m wondering how much do you think all of this would cost to fix this problem and how should that be apportioned to the people that have interest in it? ", "7789 MS. LOWELL: I do believe -- and I will support that we should pay part of the cost. I mean I have no argument to that. ", "7790 I don\u2019t have any information on how much it would cost to fill this gap, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s, you know, tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars according to -- to do so.", "7791 So for that to be borne by the small number of residents, I think it\u2019s -- I think that would be a little bit too much.", "7792 I keep coming back to when I look at the area in which we live and all of the other areas that they have serviced along the way, and some areas with densities of the same as ours, but they -- TELUS decided to service those areas but they left us out.", "7793 So I can\u2019t reconcile that it should be totally borne by the residents when the company has demonstrated that they wouldn\u2019t go into lower density areas on their own at any rate.", "7794 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes. I just have one final question for you before I pass you back over to my colleagues.", "7795 Were you aware of this situation before you moved to your residence? Have you lived there a long time or is this something that happened afterwards or did you move in with a set of expectations?", "7796 MS. LOWELL: No, we moved in, knowing that the area did not have service. We\u2019ve lived there for six years now. I guess we also moved in with the view of looking at other areas that were sparsely populated as well, and they were ultimately brought service, so thinking that, at some point along the line, we would get served.", "7797 It was about three years or two and a half years ago, when TELUS made their announcement that they were going to bring in fibre optics to the Sunshine Coast. And the understanding that we got initially was they were going to work their way up the highway and provide it to all the neighbourhoods along the way. And so we thought, okay, great, you know, it will finally come to pass.", "7798 But at first, there were no promises. And then, as the -- you know, the expansion build went out, they decided to leave out our neighbourhood.", "7799 I personally believe that they had data that said there were fewer people living in the area than there truly are. And based on that data, they decided not to service our area. And now, you know, it\u2019s the proverbial train left the station, and they had already designed the system and we were not included in it.", "7800 So now, trying to do it as a retrofit, it comes out to be standalone and potentially more costly.", "7801 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "7802 MS. LOWELL: But to answer your question, no, we did not have an expectation that we would get internet. I guess, it\u2019s just so close but yet so far.", "7803 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes, okay.", "7804 Thank you, those are all my questions.", "7805 THE CHAIRPERSON: So I was just polling our colleagues here to see if there were any other questions and apparently not. ", "7806 So thank you very much, Ms. Lowell, for participating in our proceeding. It\u2019s very much appreciated, and I hope you have a safe journey back home. So thank you.", "7807 MS. LOWELL: Thank you very much.", "7808 THE CHAIRPERSON: The next panel is really big; well, not extraordinarily big but it\u2019s just a larger panel, so it takes a little bit of time to move in and out. ", "7809 So why don\u2019t we take a short 10-minute break to set that up? So come back at five minutes to 3:00. Thanks.", "--- Upon recessing at 2:44 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 2:57 p.m.", "7810 THE CHAIRPERSON: Good afternoon, gentlemen.", "7813 We will now hear the presentation of TELUS Communications Company. Please introduce yourself and your colleagues, and you have 15 minutes for your presentation.", "PRESENTATION", "7814 MR. WOODHEAD: Mr. Chairman, we heard and acknowledge the statement that you made on behalf of the Panel prior to the lunch break. And in our oral presentation, in response to the questions you and the Panel may have, we would endeavour to address some of the issues and concerns that you brought forward.", "7815 Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Vice-Chair Menzies and Commissioners. My name is Ted Woodhead, Senior Vice President, Federal Government and Regulatory Affairs, at TELUS.", "7816 With me today on our panel are some of my colleagues from TELUS, as well as two telecommunications policy experts. Starting at my far left, Chris Langdon, Vice President, Consumer Products and Services; Cl\u00e9ment Audet, Vice-pr\u00e9sident, March\u00e9 consommateurs et Centres de contact client TELUS Qu\u00e9bec; and Stephen Schmidt, Vice President, Telecom Policy and Chief Regulatory Legal Counsel.", "7817 And on my right, Eros Spadotto, Executive Vice President, Technology Strategy; Dr. Richard Schultz, James McGill Professor, McGill University; and Dr. Robert Crandall, Non-Resident Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution.", "7818 And behind me, from my left to right, Orest Romaniuk, Vice President and Controller; Alan Hamilton, Director, Regulatory Affairs; and Bob Sinclair, TELUS Fellow, Technology Strategy.", "7819 There is little controversy that voice and ancillary services are important to Canadians and that they should be basic telecommunications services for all providers and across all platforms.", "7820 What has preoccupied this proceeding, however, is broadband. The debate in this proceeding is about how to provide as many Canadians as possible with access to high quality broadband at reasonable rates.", "7821 Chairman Blais, last week at the outset of this hearing, you challenged parties to provide evidence to underpin their submissions. This is what we have done to date.", "7822 Our remarks will proceed in five parts. First, an overview of Canada\u2019s performance on a comparative, international basis. Second, our submissions on availability, affordability, and adoption of broadband internet service in Canada. Third, the issue of subsidies for basic telecommunications services. Fourth, the history of universal service in Canada as it relates to this proceeding. Fifth and finally, a brief response to some of the points that other parties have made to date.", "7823 Dr. Crandall\u2019s evidence shows that when compared with other developed countries, Canada\u2019s broadband performance is remarkable, despite the acute challenges posed by the country\u2019s vast size, challenging topography, and very low population density.", "7824 Canada\u2019s broadband penetration is among the highest in the world, and it is above the median in Table 1, despite the fact that Canada\u2019s population density is far below all but two countries in the table.", "7825 Capital expenditure on Canadian communications infrastructure has been substantial when compared to other developed countries. OECD data on communications sector capital spending per access path show that Canadian carriers have spent more than their U.S. counterparts and about twice as much as E.U. carriers per access path since 2007 as illustrated in Figure 1.", "7826 DR. CRANDALL: Broadband speeds in Canada have also increased steadily. The growth and availability of broadband access at 100 megabits per second or more has been particularly rapid, climbing from just 16 percent of Canadian households in 2010 to 71 percent in 2014, as shown in Figure 2. ", "7827 The 2015 Communications Monitoring Report also shows internet access at download speeds of 5 megabits per second or more is available to 96 percent of Canadians. And Xplornet also indicates it can now offer speeds of 5 megabits per second ---", "7828 THE SECRETARY: Sorry, can you just please slow down?", "7829 DR. CRANDALL: Okay. Five megabits per second to 100 percent of Canadians at present. ", "7830 MR. WOODHEAD: TELUS proposes that broadband internet at 5 megabits per second downstream and 1 megabit per second upstream be a basic telecommunications service.", "7831 The Commission\u2019s analysis in CRTC Exhibit 1, Industry Canada\u2019s Digital Canada 150 report, and the FCC data reported by Dr. Crandall all agree that basic functions on the internet -- email, web surfing, basic streaming of video -- even with three users in a household conducting these activities simultaneously only requires a download speed of 1 to 2 megabits per second, and that 4 megabits per second is more than sufficient for even most high-definition products. ", "7832 DR. CRANDALL: Canadian broadband prices are low to moderate by international standards despite the obvious high costs of providing such services in Canada\u2019s low population density environment. ", "7833 The FCC\u2019s International Broadband Report shows that the price per megabit per second of broadband download speed for standalone broadband service declined in Canada from $6.22 in U.S. dollars in 2001 to $4.16 in 2013. This was lower than the average of $4.33 cents per megabit per second for the 37 countries for which data were reported.", "7834 MR. WOODHEAD: Nonetheless, we recognize that some low income residential customers have difficulty paying for broadband services, just as they have a problem paying for other goods and services. Federal and provincial governments are in the best position to address income issues by means of tax policy and other initiatives.", "7835 The Commission has a limited ability to address income problems through price reductions for the services it regulates, and such policies, if implemented, are likely to be costly, difficult to administer, and ultimately of limited impact because the problem of poverty is far vaster than the price of any one good or service.", "7836 For its part, TELUS has developed its own pilot program and has been in discussions with various government departments, including the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Employment and Social Development Canada, the Canada Revenue Agency, the Computers for Success program, and various library associations to develop and implement a more affordable internet package targeted to low income families with children, priced at 9.95 a month. ", "7837 This program, pilot program, would also address other key barriers to broadband adoption by providing qualifying households with a low cost or free computing device, digital literacy training, and software from other local agencies including TELUS.", "7838 Having access to broadband and actually using it are two different issues. We know from the 2015 CRTC Communications Monitoring Report that while 99 percent of Canadian households have a broadband connection available to them only 82 percent of Canadian households have a broadband subscription. It is this 17 percent gap that represents the major digital economy opportunity for both government and the private sector in Canada. ", "7839 DR. CRANDALL: Empirical surveys in both Canada and other developed countries demonstrate that people who are younger, better educated, and earn a higher income are more likely to use broadband. These same surveys demonstrate that price is not a significant barrier to adoption. Lowering the price of broadband will not, on its own, increase adoption perceptibly where these other barriers exist. ", "7840 It is difficult for the Commission to address these major drivers of adoption, age, income, and education. But one important thing the Commission can do is refrain from unbundling Canadian broadband networks. Multi-country empirical studies have shown that jurisdictions with wholesale forbearance and platform competition have higher broadband adoption than jurisdictions that emphasize the unbundling of networks. MR. WOODHEAD: That said, the Commission can give focus and direction to adoption initiatives in Canada because it will be the only agency conducting and coordinating research in this area.", "7841 DR. CRANDALL: Proponents of new subsidy schemes advocate programs for broadband expansion that are unnecessary, are not based on sound analysis, and are likely to be ineffective and costly.", "7842 With respect to the Affordable Access Coalition\u2019s low-income affordability program, their expert Mr. Sepulveda uses the United States, France, and Spain to establish a benchmark range of funding. But Mr. Sepulveda does not explain why these countries\u2019 policies provide a useful benchmark. Why should Canada strive to spend a similar share of telecommunications revenues on a similar program?", "7843 With respect to the broadband deployment subsidy, Mr. Sepulveda uses the average of spending on high-cost subsidy programs as a percentage of telecommunications revenues in Australia and the United States. Once again, he provides no rationale for suggesting that Canada should spend a similar proportion of revenues on a new broadband deployment subsidy. In fact, the evidence from the United States is that its high-cost universal service program has not yielded measurable benefits.", "7844 Mr. Sepulveda fails to provide any estimate of the benefits and the full cost of these two proposed programs.", "7845 Before we leave the issue of subsidies, I would like to mention Bell\u2019s proposal to end the subsidy regime in Rate Bands E and F. This proposal is unprincipled, based on faulty analysis and may jeopardize telephone service to Canadians in high cost serving areas. The proposal is based on the same reports of alleged bias in the Phase II costing methodology that they presented to the Commission in 2010. I have fully explained this in my evidence in this proceeding.", "7846 DR. SCHULTZ: Some of the submissions before you premise their proposals for extensive and expensive subsidy programs on the claim that Canadian telecommunications policy has had a longstanding public policy of universal service. However, this is not the case. While Canada did develop what is considered to be universal telephone service, this was done not through regulatory intervention but as a result of corporate practice. It arose simply and solely as a result of federally regulated telephone companies employing pricing to make telephone service available as widely as possible.", "7847 If these parties want to justify their proposals, instead of relying on a false restatement of the history of universal service, they instead need to look at what they will do, how they will implement it, and what it will cost. And they need to demonstrate that the economic and social benefits exceed the economic costs. ", "7848 DR. CRANDALL: I would like to briefly address some of the testimony heard last week from Dr. Winseck of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. Dr. Winseck\u2019s testimony is at best misleading and in several cases simply wrong. I would be happy to address Dr. Winseck\u2019s errors in detail should the Commission so request, but here are the three most egregious of his misstatements. ", "7849 First, Dr. Winseck said that the FCC adopted a new standard of 25 megabits per second download and 3 megabits per second upload to be available to all Americans in a timely fashion. That is not true. The FCC did not establish a new standard of 25/3. It simply defined advanced services, not basic services, as those requiring 25/3.", "7850 Second, Dr. Winseck said that all Europeans will have access above 30 megabits by 2020, and at least half of all households will subscribe to the internet connections above 100 megabits by 2020. This is not true. Most EU countries have not committed to a set of policies that will get them to these goals, and the European Commission now openly admits that its policies have suppressed broadband investment, greatly impeding the ability of countries to achieve these goals. Third, Dr. Winseck said that Canada ranks at the bottom of the pack in terms of average monthly prices and the cost of a gigabyte of data. This is also untrue. With respect to the OECD data that Dr. Winseck cites, he misses the point entirely. The OECD data report only one provider per country for each broadband service and thus not representative of the country as a whole. The data for Canada are drawn only from Bell and Shaw and each observation is drawn from either Bell or Shaw; twelve (12) from Bell and 3 from Shaw. ", "7851 In all but 7 countries, the OECD data are drawn only from one new entrant that often only serves major metropolitan areas. ", "7852 Obviously, these carriers have lower costs and lower prices than ILECs can offer throughout the country. ", "7853 Finally, they advertise speeds vary substantially within each of the OECD\u2019s 18 categories, making comparisons even more difficult.", "7854 MR. WOODHEAD: Canada has achieved -- excuse-me -- Canada has achieved a remarkable level of broadband performance despite geographical challenges. Three decisions, in particular, are foundational.", "7855 The public policy decision to choose competitive supply over unitary supply as the basic model for telecommunications in Canada; the Commission\u2019s decision to focus on competing networks, platform competition, as opposed to unbundling and resale of a single monopoly network as the basis for achieving competition; the decision to substantially forbear from retail regulation in favour of market forces as the primary basis for determining prices, quality and terms and conditions for the provision of services.", "7856 The continuation of Canada\u2019s strong relative broadband performance depends on maintaining a commitment to these foundational decisions.", "7857 To the extent that there are challenges with broadband availability, affordability or adoption, they are focused ones. ", "7858 The Commission\u2019s remedies should be similarly focused and proportional. TELUS makes the following three recommendations.", "7859 Continue to monitor broadband availability to support other government initiatives by providing the information that can underpin governmental programs.", "7860 Maintain a robust commitment to facilities-based competition policies by limiting mandatory unbundling of broadband networks and thirdly, but in some ways most importantly, develop a blueprint that that identifies adoption issues, responsible actors, and relevant problems to inform and focus subsequent action.", "7861 Thank you for allowing us for the opportunity to speak to you.", "7862 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Commissioner Molnar will start us off.", "7863 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Good afternoon. I don\u2019t normally make these comments, but it is a bit intimidating for me to look at 10 men in suits, so.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "7864 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So I\u2019ll be kind with my questions, you be kind with your answers and we\u2019ll work together to solutions hopefully here.", "7865 And if you heard the -- and I know you did hear the comments of our Chair just before lunch and really what we\u2019re trying to do now is really focus our hearing here on solutions as to where there may be gaps. ", "7866 You\u2019ve made a statement here at the end that there is a lot of success in the broadband performance and hopefully you would agree there are also some gaps.", "7867 MR. WOODHEAD: That we would agree, yes.", "7868 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right so, I\u2019m going to try and focus my questions on that and as you heard, looking for concrete sort of directions as to what\u2019s the best way to address those. ", "7869 So you had structured the remarks going into here in \u201cwe need to define the basic telecom service\u201d, \u201cwe need to define the need\u201d and then you went through unavailability, affordability and adoption.", "7870 Your comments here follow that same flow. Would you say if we were talking about a broadband strategy that we should be considering other key items that ---", "7871 ` MR. WOODHEAD: I think -- I think those are the key ones. The -- you know, there might be sub-chapters to some of these topics because for example -- or sort of a forward looking view of where technology is going.

WOODHEAD: In filling it?", "7960 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- in filling it? ", "7961 MR. WOODHEAD: Potentially, and I say that only because one of the things which coincidentally, I particularly thought was helpful in the Panel's statement prior to lunch, is that I think, coming out of this process, because the record is so voluminous and there are so many interesting comments that have been made by all sorts of parties on this record, that there are a number of -- and between when the statement was made prior to lunch, I haven't had all that much time to kind of noodle that over.", "7962 But there's certainly a lot of recommendations, I think, off the top of my head, that the Commission could make around coordinating funding, simplifying funding, you know, applications, simplifying the mapping so everybody knows what's going on.

", "7968 COMMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I want to go back to before we fund it, one of the values that we can deliver is perhaps, a fulsome definition of what we consider basic. And we talked about the 5-1. You didn\u2019t talk about whether or not you think that there would be value in defining quality, the quality at service so that there's some equity across the -- you know, as these funds go in place that there would be some kind of equitable standards as to what somebody can expect from their service as it relates to the quality and reliability.", "7969 MR. WOODHEAD: Some -- I mean I'll ask some of my fellow panel members to respond here but my initial sense, Commissioner, would be there is -- I am unaware of any evidence that the quality of networks and the quality of service that people are provided with, short of gaps where the service is below the basic service -- basic telecom level that we've talked about for broadband anyway, I am unaware of, frankly, any profound quality problem that needs setting of those kinds of standards.", "7970 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Certainly we've heard from those reliant on satellite that there were issues with latency, that there's potentially issues with oversubscription.", "7971 MR. WOODHEAD: Perhaps I'd ask Mr. Spadotto to ---", "7972 MR. SPADOTTO: Allow me to chime in, Commissioner. Thank you for asking the question.", "7973 You know, I think when we take a look at various technologies, all the technologies have their pluses and minuses. So it's, you know, unfortunate kind of human behaviour to pull out, you know, things that don\u2019t often work well. So satellite does have some issues like latency.", "7974 Unfortunately or fortunately, when you take a look at what we consider to be basic services, those latency requirements don\u2019t really impede them. So, you know, if you think about what we want out of our society, that is the ability for Okshoger (ph) to be connected, that is the ability for us to, you know, participate in applying for jobs and things of that nature, none of those basic needs are impeded by latency.", "7975 So while that impediment exists, it is not an impediment towards basic services.", "7976 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. So let me go then away from sort of the quality of the connection to elements such as mean time to repair for example. I mean if you're -- should there be basics as to when somebody is provided a basic service, its availability? I mean if it's taking three or four days to get it back up?", "7977 MR. WOODHEAD: Well, if by that you mean -- I mean certainly it shouldn\u2019t an obligation just an ILEC.", "7978 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I'm not talking just an ILEC.", "7979 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah.", "7980 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: We're talking ---", "7981 MR. WOODHEAD: I mean I think where you're going to ---", "7982 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- overall. We're talking here as we started, you know, here's the base knowing that many Canadians today are able to have access to services far above this base. Here's the minimum that every Canadian should be able to expect of their communication system.", "7983 MR. WOODHEAD: Okay. So I'm referring now to your MTTR comment. I think the difficulty we'd have there is because again we have -- we for ourselves have next-day appointment, like this is not -- this is like a fairly finely-tuned machine at TELUS but I think you're going to have a problem setting any kind of basic standard unless you split it out by technology, or you split it out by technology plus location, or you split it out by technology, location and topography, because there is some technologies and, you know, where the amount of windshield time that you're going to have to spend to do that is determined by all kinds of external factors, including distance, topography, whatever.", "7984 MR. SPADOTTO: Yeah, exactly. I think, Commissioner, this is exactly what I was going to chime in as well. I would hazard if you take a look at our statistics or any operator\u2019s statistics on their meantime to restore, the predominance of it is going to be windshield time, the time to actually get to the particular component that has failed and to repair it.", "7985 And so therefore, you have to kind of take a look at, in many ways, the vastness of Canada and what we've subscribed to or what the individuals subscribe to and how difficult it is to actually get there to repair that particular part.", "7986 So I think if we were to look at -- as a community to take a look at what can we do on that, I think we have to be aware of exactly that, where these areas are and what's the reality of us actually -- whoever the party may be getting there to, you know, execute a repair.", "7987 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, and I actually have a little bit of experience in that part of the business and I'm not disputing that there's a windshield time. There is fly time. You know, in some of the remote, it's fly time and the cost of both providing and maintaining that service is relative to how you define it, right?", "7988 MR. WOODHEAD: Right.", "7989 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So all I'm asking is do you think it is fair to define quality elements into that service?", "7990 I mean if all you say is you can have basic services 5/1, it can be oversubscribed. It can -- you know, it can have all kinds of technical components. It can be out for a week before you fly somebody in on the next provisioning day or whatever it is. I don\u2019t know if you've really given -- you know, some of these being subsidized to provide a service of that quality, one should assume there's a quality to that service.", "7991 MR. SPADOTTO: Yes, and I would -- you know, I'd answer the question of MTTR. You know, the natural backstop against MTTR is MTBF which is mean time between failure. So, you know, for many of us in the technology world and I would echo your experience, you've lived in this world, technology choice is often made to have very great MTBF.", "7992 So in those instances where you do unfortunately have something that's gone awry, it is far -- you know, very far between. And so you kind of engineer and build the networks in that instance. And I think that's the same -- again, if we're thinking this is a community question, that's the same for all of us that participate in these technologies. That's part of what we do. It doesn\u2019t matter if we're a telco operator, a cable operator, a satellite operator or, you know, a fixed wireless operator, that kind of enters our thinking.", "7993 MR. WOODHEAD: And if I may, Commissioner, I mean of course you could do that. I guess what my question would be, is there a need to do that or answering the question why are we doing that because the -- I mean I think the market actually works quite well in that respect but -- and to acknowledge that the Commission has stepped back from retail quality service based on the fact that it's a competitive market for a number of years.", "7994 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I think you're very concerned about something I perhaps am not even thinking about. I haven\u2019t considered in my question -- when I was asking the question, I wasn\u2019t considering imposing Q of S standards on forborne markets as much as I was thinking about, as we're closing the gaps for Canadians where market forces are not there to provide them with service, how should that service be defined?", "7995 MR. WOODHEAD: Fair enough. I misapprehended with ---", "7996 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You're very worried and I wasn't trying to worry you.", "7997 MR. WOODHEAD: I\u2019m not worried. I wasn't worried. I was just confused apparently.", "7998 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No, no, sorry. I'm at this point talking about closing the gaps and I'm prepared to not have, in this discussion, challenged you on the availability of service in forborne markets -- or no, I can\u2019t say that well because -- or in markets where there's competitive supply.", "7999 MR. SCHMIDT: To try to assist you on your more focused question, ma\u2019am, I think it's reasonable and it would be entirely opened to a public authority funding broadband expansion to set all sorts of specifications. It's a contracting process. So people are voluntarily taking funding and the public authority funding could conceivably voluntarily set those standards. And in a more generalized basis, it's not obvious as we seem to agree the evidence leads us to some broadband QoS regime.", "8000 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. So who do you think is in the best position to set those standards?", "8001 MR. WOODHEAD: I actually -- I actually think that you folks might be and in terms of -- as Stephen said, in terms of these monies that are being expanded, I am told that in that past, past iterations of, for example, the Connecting Canadians program at the -- as the outcome was achieved, the outcome didn\u2019t appear to look like what outcome was promised at the beginning. So it might actually, to be honest, be useful to establish or to set, say like, you know, when you\u2019re running these funding programs the outcome needs to look something like what was promised at the outset. And it needs to perform like this, this, this and this and needs little subcategories.", "8002 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Could I ask that you would undertake to provide the suggested quality of service metrics?", "8003 MR. WOODHEAD: To be used within a contracting process like that and how that would work?", "8004 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. Well, I don\u2019t know if you have to go so far as to tell us how it would work, but define the --", "8005 MR. WOODHEAD: Certain types of --", "8006 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- what the metrics would --", "8007 MR. WOODHEAD: -- industry ---", "8008 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- be to say, you know, if you\u2019re going out contracting, it\u2019s both speed, reliability. Here\u2019s how you define reliability. Here\u2019s the -- here\u2019s what you want to get back.", "8009 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes.", "8010 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Here\u2019s what you want to measure against.", "8011 MR. WOODHEAD: I think we could do that.", "8012 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay.", "8013 ", "UNDERTAKING ", "8014 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Before I get off of the issue of speed, and this is taking me longer than I should. These folks are going to be here a long time. Would you see any value in setting aspirational targets? ", "8015 I mean, one of the dangers as we\u2019re speaking of, you know, contracting to fill the gaps, you want to build to future needs. You don\u2019t want to build to present needs when you\u2019re making long-term capital investments. So do you think it\u2019s reasonable to look at five one for unserved and underserved? Like to build to that level? Or should it be building to a future level?", "8016 MR. WOODHEAD: Sorry, I got confused there. I thought you were going to --", "8017 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I\u2019m still talking ---", "8018 MR. WOODHEAD: -- ask me about an aspirational target and now, sorry ---", "8019 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I am really. I guess maybe I said that wrongly then.", "8020 MR. WOODHEAD: Or maybe I just ---", "8021 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But what I was thinking, I mean, if we were to say -- and I don\u2019t know what the outcome, but lots of people are proposing five and one. If we were to say if you\u2019re not achieving five and one with significant, you know, reliability and so on, you are underserved, and therefore, the -- you know, the focus is on filling the gaps. As you fill those gaps, as you inject capital and investment to fill those gaps, should you be building that for future capacity?", "8022 MR. WOODHEAD: Okay. In terms of a general aspirational target, I don\u2019t think -- I -- you know, you can do that. I don\u2019t think it hurts anybody. But it isn\u2019t going to -- to be perfectly honest with you, it isn\u2019t going to really drive investment decisions that Mr. Spadotto makes. Where I -- where we -- when we receive funding for connecting Canadians or the other programs where we\u2019ve received funding and we upgrade services in areas, that\u2019s exactly what happens.", "8023 So you go from a 5, 1 profile to capability of 15 or 25 megabytes because the money has gone to that. So that happens kind of naturally. But as a general matter ---", "8024 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So could you potentially just say that it -- a requirement is that it be scalable? That whatever technology --", "8025 MR. WOODHEAD: Oh, yeah.", "8026 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- is in place ---", "8027 MR. WOODHEAD: In terms of -- in -- sure. Sure.", "8028 MR. SPADOTTO: If I could chime in, Commissioner. I think one of the things that, you know, if we take a look at the way we make our investments -- and we\u2019ve chatted about this in the past, so I don\u2019t want to repeat myself in how we do it. But we obviously look at the future and what\u2019s, you know, what\u2019s going to be required in the future.", "8029 I think if we set aspirational goals though -- and again, I\u2019m thinking from the perspective of us as a community. If we set aspirational goals, I think then we need to start defining how basic needs evolve over time. What are the basic needs? And if we actually get a view for basic needs as they evolve over time, then we can start aspirationally looking at how can we fulfil them with our different technology choices as they move along?", "8030 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: What are you provisioning to today within your ---", "8031 MR. SPADOTTO: It depends where; right? So what are we provisioning to depends where in our network. ", "8032 So you take a cross-section of our fibre network, depending on what people are subscribing to, you can get, you know, upwards of 100 megabytes per second. You go into our copper network, depending on where people are getting the service, they may get 50 megabytes per second. You go on our wireless network, again, depending on where people are situated, they may get 1, 2, 5, 10, depends on -- depending on the wire.", "8033 So the decisions on investments are made on cross-sections and where those networks are and what the capabilities are.", "8042 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Fair enough. And maybe it\u2019s how much money do we need to serve all Canadians.", "8043 Can I ask a particular question about LTE? Because we hear satellite LTE. If we were -- actually, I\u2019m not speaking for anybody else. This is just me. So don\u2019t be afraid. But I\u2019ve wondered sometimes, particularly for rural areas, and a number of parties have come forward, you know, Xplornet\u2019s using LTE, the B.C. Broadband Association has partners that are using LTE. Do you use LTE to serve any broadband customers, particularly broadband?", "8044 MR. SPADOTTO: So as Mr. Audet already mentioned that we\u2019ve taken on a -- call it -- it started off as a call it as an experiment in the Gasp\u00e9sie when we used HSPA to provide HSA-type services over a wireless network. Those HSPA networks are being upgraded to LTE for all the obvious reasons because LTE has, you know, greater throughput for the spectrum to utilize. ", "8045 So the, you know, the quick answer is, yes, we are and we are going to continue doing that.", "8046 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So the reason I ask is we have a large record. There\u2019s many Canadians have given their views. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that there\u2019s been a lot of focus on broadband, but there\u2019s also been a lot of focus on mobility, both on the voice and data side. And Canadians want ubiquitous mobile service. And Canadians want universal broadband service. And if there\u2019s a technology that could help to deliver both, is that not a preferred technology? If you\u2019re creating a broadband strategy, would it make sense -- I know you folks want to be technology agnostic, but is there a preferred technology? ", "8047 MR. SPADOTTO: Commissioner, I don\u2019t think we want to be technology agnostic for the sake of being agnostic. We want to be technology agnostic because there are different technologies that are better suited to deliver speeds in different areas.

SPADOTTO: We have but again, even when you get out into the rural areas called the \u201cunderserved areas\u201d, then you have to have a density of cell sites in order to support them, in order to be able to affect the speeds that we\u2019re talking about.", "8052 And that density is often very difficult, in particular, in some parts of Canada, not only because of backhaul, as Mr. Woodhead has talked about, but often times we work in areas where there just isn\u2019t even power; where, you know, we can send along some really incredible pictures of LTE sites that we have. They\u2019re sitting on tops of mountains that are prime powered. There is no power there. We actually, you know, have to go and bring fuel up to those locations.", "8053 When the winter comes, we kind of have to kiss them goodbye for the winter. We\u2019ll see you in the springtime. Very, very difficult areas to cover in Canada.", "8054 And so there isn\u2019t a singular solution because of that.", "8055 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Fair enough.", "8056 I guess I was wondering if it could be a preferred solution because there\u2019s ancillary benefits to many Canadians.", "8057 MR. SPADOTTO: Again for me, I would shy away from preferential treatments because I think then it could cause us to -- it could cause the community to misinterpret what is meant by \u201cpreferred\u201d and then not use or not be able to use or decide against using technologies that are more suited for a particular application.", "8058 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So we\u2019ve actually talked about -- I have a page full of questions that I kind of shot at you now and then.", "8059 So I\u2019m almost through, but I was on the area of availability and I had -- I have one question here that I haven\u2019t asked. And so it\u2019s a little sitting out there, but I\u2019ll ask it just to sort of close off on this.", "8060 As we were talking about earlier -- about subsidy programs or directing government investment and what we might do to assist in directing that, providing guidance or so on. What\u2019s your experience on how prices have been established within the government programs, the price to consumer? ", "8061 MR. WOODHEAD: You -- in the \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d one, we had to state, I believe Cl\u00e9ment may know better than I, what the price that we would offer the service at, so they ---", "8069 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So in your situation, if you\u2019re going into a subsidized pocket, those consumers are lucky enough, I guess, because of your economies of scale and so on, and your pricing practices, to have the same prices as non-subsidized areas.", "8070 I didn\u2019t get that from everybody who\u2019s come before us, in how prices are set to where those prices are the same as in more urban areas. ---", "8071 MR. WOODHEAD: Our ---", "8072 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But you set the price?", "8073 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah.", "8074 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You go into that bidding process?", "8075 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah. And so what happens -- and so what happens in terms of the program administrators, who evaluate the various proposals, is they look at what -- you know, I don\u2019t know if this is all of the factors -- but they would look at what\u2019s the end product? What are you going to provide consumers with, in terms of speed and capability? What price are you going to do it at? What is the cost and how many homes or households are you going to serve? Those are four of the big ones anyway.", "8076 And then they evaluate them on that basis.", "8077 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I\u2019m going to ask the question, even though I know -- I expect I know your answer.", "8078 Would you say there would be a role for the Commission in establishing what that price perhaps could or should be for areas that are subsidized through government funding?", "8079 MR. WOODHEAD: No. I think if government funding is involved, they should be set at some -- you know, based on market prices.", "8080 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: There\u2019s no market where government funding is ---", "8081 MR. WOODHEAD: I\u2019m sorry?", "8082 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: What market prices are you speaking of, where government funding is involved?", "8083 MR. WOODHEAD: Well I -- we get, we get government funding and, you know, in community A, either there\u2019s service already or -- and to extend service to outward homes in the same community, they get the same prices as everybody in that market.", "8084 MR. SCHMIDT: The provision of the service in the end, pursuant to the public program, may look like a practical monopoly, but the funnel to get in there is competitive because it\u2019s a bidding process. So people have the opportunity to compete on the cost of it, on the features of the end process, et cetera. ", "8085 And you have other things hovering around like satellite that are conditioning your pricing ultimately or you won\u2019t get access to the funds.", "8086 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. So today, you\u2019re competing on -- on cost, on price.", "8087 I mean, you\u2019re seeking -- you\u2019re competing for the subsidy amount but in determining what subsidy amount you need -- and it\u2019s not you, I mean, it\u2019s any service provider -- you are considering what price the market can bear; how you would define the service; what kind of usage and data might go; what speed; what subscription ratio.", "8088 So you\u2019re defining all kinds of elements to come to what that shortfall might be that you\u2019re seeking subsidy for?", "8089 MR. SCHMIDT: Yes.", "8090 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Including deciding the price?", "8091 MR. SCHMIDT: Yes.", "8092 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah, and in our case, as Cl\u00e9ment said, we don\u2019t price differently within provinces. Others may ---", "8093 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Is that a reasonable principle for extending service to unserved areas?", "8094 MR. WOODHEAD: No, I ---", "8095 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That it should be priced ---", "8096 MR. WOODHEAD: I mean prices -- that is our decision to have done that, but prices should follow, you know, the cost. And if there\u2019s a higher cost to a particularly remote area, I think it should be open to a provider.", "8097 I mean, what you would be setting yourself up for there, potentially, is failure, to me. Because if somebody is trying to get subsidy dollars and is trying to promise a price below what they can actually do it, then I don\u2019t think the long-term success of that is going to be very good.", "8098 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I wasn\u2019t really thinking about the time when they were promising a lower price, they could do it. I mean, you size the amount of subsidy required based on that shortfall.", "8099 I was thinking more the end where there are areas that are subsidized at relatively high rates. Nunavut, for example, I think it\u2019s $80 for they\u2019re going to have three meg. You know, that\u2019s the other end of it. That was a determined price. Someone determined that price.", "8100 So I\u2019ll go on. I want to move on to the area of affordability. So you have something in here that I wasn\u2019t aware of, and I\u2019m very interested in knowing more about this pilot program that you mention in paragraph 18 of your remarks here. Could you just tell me a little bit more about that program; what you\u2019re doing?", "8101 MR. WOODHEAD: Well, we\u2019ve been working on it for quite some time. And what the idea was was to get at the sort of heart of what the affordability question is because many -- you have heard from many who simply think this is a function of price. And yet, the literature -- and I may ask Dr. Crandall to comment on this -- the literature doesn\u2019t indicate that in fact it is only about price. ", "8102 It may a bit about price but it\u2019s also other factors. Price not just of the service but price of the internet appliance or device. It may be about more broadly digital literacy and a variety of other considerations.", "8103 So what we were trying to do was -- or what we\u2019re in the process of trying to do -- is to run a pilot for a year using devices from Computers for Success, which used to be called Computers for Schools but their mandate has been broadened by Innovation, Science and Economic Development to go broader. ", "8104 And so 5,000 individuals, urban, rural, all meeting the low income criteria. They\u2019re all families, low-income families so they\u2019re in receipt of the Canada Child Benefit, below $34,000 a year. And see what the data shows in terms of efficacy, what the people who are using it actually think of it, and then we were going to share that with whoever is interested.", "8105 And if that determined that, you know, this would be something to do or this would be a model to do because it more effectively meets the needs of this particular group then we would probably be coming looking to you folks to figure out a way to roll it out. ", "8106 And the intent was to try and do this nationally based on the fact that poverty is a national problem. And potentially we could do this with the rest of the industry and address this issue.", "8107 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: Did you initiate this?", "8108 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes.", "8109 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: This was initiated by TELUS?", "8110 MR. WOODHEAD: Correct.", "8111 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: And you administer it?", "8112 MR. WOODHEAD: The actual -- this becomes an important, a very important question. We actually provision the service. The people who would do the verification and authentication of the recipients would be Computers for Success. ", "8113 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: Remind me ---", "8114 MR. WOODHEAD: Computers for ---", "8115 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: I\u2019m going to say it Computers for School because that\u2019s how I know them.", "8116 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah, you can just call it that.", "8117 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: So you say ---", "8118 MR. WOODHEAD: But they\u2019ve rebranded.", "8119 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: Right. And remind me who\u2019s behind that organization? ", "8120 MR. WOODHEAD: It\u2019s run as a not-for-profit and it\u2019s run under a mandate from Industry Canada. Or sorry, Industry Canada, ISEC. ", "8121 THE CHAIRPERSON: A lot of rebranding going on. ", "8122 MR. WOODHEAD: I\u2019m sorry?", "8123 THE CHAIRPERSON: There\u2019s a lot of rebranding going on.", "8124 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes, a lot of rebranding.", "8125 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: So in talking affordability here, I appreciate right now as we\u2019re talking we are talking not about whether rates overall are just unreasonable or affordable or whatever Dr. Crandall would argue, but that there are still individuals, low income, those with disabilities or so on that, you know, whose incomes are challenged. But even what most citizens would consider a just and reasonable price is simply unaffordable. And so those are the individuals you are targeting here. You took this on by yourself.", "8126 MR. WOODHEAD: A subset of those individuals, families, low income, below threshold.", "8127 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: How did you decide that?", "8128 MR. WOODHEAD: How did we decide that?", "8129 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: How did you decide on the subset?", "8130 MR. WOODHEAD: Sorry, how did we decide to choose that as the threshold?", "8131 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: Yeah. You said it\u2019s a subset of those individuals. So who defined this program?", "8132 MR. WOODHEAD: We did it. We chose that because it was the simplest way to identify the group that we were seeking to have pilot the project; low-income families with children.", "8133 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: So ---", "8134 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah, obviously in receipt of the benefit.", "8135 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: You know, you have done this in conjunction with a number of groups and, you know, congratulations.", "8136 MR. WOODHEAD: Well, we haven\u2019t actually started the pilot yet.", "8137 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: Oh, you haven\u2019t.", "8138 MR. WOODHEAD: We\u2019re still in discussions with them to launch it.", "8139 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: Okay. Well, you\u2019ve had discussions with a number of groups, which CRTC not one of those. And yet, you said if it was to be successful you would come to us. So why would you come to us? Why would you not ---", "8140 MR. WOODHEAD: Because in the way we kind of designed this it was to pilot this and determine, as I said, whether it actually is something that works. And if it were to work and we felt strongly that it was something that should be rolled out, we would want some overarching authority with jurisdiction to make that actually a national kind of program that the industry would support, and develop funding mechanisms for it, and all kinds of things.", "8141 DR. CRANDALL: Can I say something?", "8142 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah. ", "8143 DR. CRANDALL: I think it\u2019s important to look at these pilot programs and encourage more of them. And you even have on the record, I believe, here some discussion by Scott Wallsten in the filing with Rogers of the U.S. pilot programs that were launched prior to the change of the Lifeline program, the low income program in the United States. ", "8144 I think there\u2019s something like 14 of these pilot programs, and most of them were very unsuccessful. That is, it was very -- different carriers tried different techniques to get people interested in signing up for programs and digital literacy, for signing up for broadband at lower prices. It might involve providing them with some equipment. And all but about two of them were quite unsuccessful.", "8145 So (inaudible) you could learn from what has failed, and maybe hopefully what succeeds with TELUS if you wish to go down the road of helping to design a low income affordability program. ", "8146 COMMISSIONER MOLNER: Well, I like how you said that because you said \u201chelping to design a program.\u201d I think one of the questions we have here is if broadband is unaffordable to a segment of Canadians what needs to be done, who should do it, what are the next steps?", "8147 MR. WOODHEAD: Right. And there may be a variety of actors, as we said, in identifying who they might be. The purpose of the pilot was simply -- like, it was our best attempt at addressing what we understand to be the main drivers of the adoption issue. So we were trying to get data that we could then share that said, \u201cOkay, this is what we found; what do you think?\u201d ", "8148 But I think Chris had something he wanted to say there.", "8149 MR. LANGDON: Thanks, Ted.", "8150 I would just say the program really, the genesis of it, TELUS has a long history of giving back to communities, whether through charitable things that the employees do, whether it\u2019s supporting education, which we do. So a constituent of low-income people actually came to one of our offices and talked to us about the problem. And our head of community affairs, a woman by the name of Jill Schnarr listened to them and said, \u201cDo you know what? Maybe we can help.\u201d And as they started to unpeel the problem, they quickly realized it wasn\u2019t necessarily a -- it was an affordability issue but that wasn\u2019t -- that was maybe a necessary condition but not sufficient. There were things about how do I get access to a computer; right? The upfront cost to that. There was things how do I use a computer and load software? What software should I have on it?", "8151 So these other components of the program were actually there to help us learn. And then, you know, once we understand, you know, okay, what components are really going to work and how do you authenticate or validate that someone\u2019s eligible; right? Very complex problems.", "8152 So we said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s make a pilot. Let\u2019s learn a little bit from it.\u201d And thus the size, the 5,000 person pilot.", "8153 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So is your pilot limited to individuals -- or not individuals, households that have not subscribed to internet? ", "8154 MR. WOODHEAD: No.", "8155 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you\u2019re trying to ---", "8156 MR. WOODHEAD: No.", "8157 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No. So you\u2019re not increasing adoption. You\u2019re dealing with ---", "8158 MR. WOODHEAD: I mean, people would be capable of applying who were not served, but ---", "8159 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "8160 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah.", "8161 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re targeting. Yeah.", "8162 And fair enough. And many, most of the individuals that we have heard from who\u2019ve had issues regarding affordability have, in fact, adopted. It\u2019s just -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard --", "8163 MR. WOODHEAD: M\u2019hm.", "8164 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- you\u2019ve heard them as well; right? They\u2019re making hard choices.", "8165 MR. WOODHEAD: But to clarify, we didn\u2019t -- the reason why we weren\u2019t excluding people who met the other criteria, in other words, they were families below the income threshold in receipt of the child -- Canada Child benefit, we didn\u2019t want them to feel like, well, why are you giving -- allowing these people to take advantage of this and not me, who is an existing customer. That\u2019s the only reason.", "8166 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Fair enough. And I -- you know, I understand that this is in design and it has not been implemented. And I also heard Dr. Crandall say that there\u2019s other programs out there. There\u2019s, you know, experience in other states. And I\u2019m going to go back to sort of the broader question I think I said to you. You know what? Ultimately what we would be interested in is, what are the steps? What\u2019s next? Who should be involved? How do we proceed in addressing the issue of affordability for that segment?", "8167 I mean, you\u2019ve got a pilot. We know that Rogers has something going on. What are the next steps? Who all should be involved? Who are the departments that should be involved? Who are the players that should be involved? What responsibilities should be placed on the internet service providers?", "8168 As you mentioned, TELUS is big on corporate social responsibility. I mean, all the ISPs should be. So what\u2019s the role of the ISPs? What are the next steps? And maybe that\u2019s an undertaking because I understand you didn\u2019t come in looking to talk about that. But if we\u2019re moving this --", "8169 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah, that\u2019s fine. We can ---", "8170 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- strategy forward, we need those.", "8171 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah.", "8172 ", "UNDERTAKING ", "8173 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I\u2019m going to talk now, not about the sub-segment of low income Canadians, but of all Canadians within the market who have challenges with broadband and the prices of broadband and data usage caps and all that, and just understanding the complexities of broadband service. And there are, because you talked speed, you talked caps. You hit your cap you have to upgrade your speed to get a bigger cap. It\u2019s all quite confusing.", "8174 So could you tell me, what is the most affordable package that you provide in each of the provinces, Alberta, B.C. and Quebec?", "8175 MR. WOODHEAD: I\u2019d ask Chris and Clement to take that one.", "8176 MR. LANGDON: I\u2019ll speak for B.C. and Alberta and then my colleague Clement will speak for Quebec.", "8177 Our cheapest internet package is $53. And that includes 150 gigabytes of data. We also have unlimited add-ons for to address overage. So clients can subscribe to that for as low as $15 and then get unlimited usage on those plans.", "8178 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Just to confirm, and that is everywhere throughout Alberta and B.C.?", "8179 MR. LANGDON: That is correct.", "8180 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That\u2019s why Ms. Lowell wanted you guys to serve her in B.C.", "8181 Okay. Quebec.", "8182 MR. AUDET: And in Quebec, for internet six; okay? Because we have also internet lite but it\u2019s a regular pricing. It\u2019s $49 a month. But it comes with less capacity. It\u2019s 40 gigabytes.", "8183 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And what\u2019s the speed?", "8184 MR. AUDET: The speed is six megabytes per second.", "8185 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Sorry. Yeah.", "8186 MR. AUDET: And it goes up to -- we have plans at 15, 25, 50 and 100.", "8187 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "8188 And can you tell me, what kind of tools do you provide your customers to enable them to make smart choices and choose what would be the most affordable option for them?", "8189 MR. LANGDON: It starts in the store, in our websites, in our call centres. So we make sure that all of our front facing team members are armed with, you know, information on our plans and the overages. And then also communicate to clients how they can manage their tools or manage their usage.", "8190 So we\u2019ve spent a fair bit on our website showing various usages scenarios. So if you\u2019re a heavy user of email and web browsing all the way to, you know, you\u2019re doing lots of file sharing and, you know, the whole family\u2019s watching Netflix for, you know, multiple, multiple hours. So we then guide people to not only the right speed profile for that, but also the right usage bucket.", "8191 So as I alluded to before, in some cases, clients may be more advantaged to go on an unlimited plan. So we offer that.", "8192 Now in terms of once the client is actually using the service, we offered a series of notifications. So at 75 percent, 90 percent on our fixed line side. And they can go onto the website and actually see that. We will in the next -- actually, it\u2019s the next week or so, that notification on how much they\u2019ve used will actually be available on their self-serve account within 20 to 30 minutes. So near real time so they don\u2019t have to worry about oh, I didn\u2019t -- I used it. How much did I use? How much do I have left?", "8193 So these notifications combined with the availability and on our website through self-serve tools will give them visibility into what they\u2019re using.", "8194 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: If a customer was routinely using less than the size of package that they had, would you notify them in any way?", "8195 MR. LANGDON: They would see on their self-serve account how much they used relative to their cap. It\u2019s actually very simple graphical tools like a doughnut. It shows you how much ---", "8196 THE CHAIRPERSON: I don\u2019t think that was the question.", "8197 MR. LANGDON: No, we do not show them -- well, no, we do show them. We just don\u2019t notify them. So is showing on a website notifying?", "8198 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But it was the answer and the answer was no.", "8199 MR. LANGDON: Yes.", "8200 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Thank you.", "8201 A couple things that probably are best done by undertaking just to fill in the record here. Could we get information on your practices as it regards your -- how you deal with customers if they have confusion around their contract terms? And would you be able to provide a copy of your contract for us?", "8202 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes.", "8203 ", "UNDERTAKING", "8204 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Could you also provide the number one complaint that you receive about your contracts? Would you know that?", "8205 MR. WOODHEAD: We would know it.", "8206 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You would know it. So you can undertake to provide that?", "8207 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah.", "8208 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "8209 ", "UNDERTAKING ", "8210 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. ", "8211 Oh, I\u2019m also supposed to ask for the associated -- as well as the internet service contract or service agreement, any associated documents such as your privacy policy, et cetera. If you\u2019ll undertake to provide that with your standard contract?", "8212 MR. WOODHEAD: Any associated policy -- like including?", "8213 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Documents that you would reference within your contract.", "8214 MR. WOODHEAD: Oh, okay.", "8215 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That you\u2019re referencing --", "8216 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah.", "8217 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- within your contract that are --", "8218 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah.", "8219 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- supporting that.", "8220 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes, we can do -- we can provide that, Commissioner.", "8221 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Like terms of service, some I think have acceptable use policies, whatever that might be.", "8222 MR. WOODHEAD: We can provide all of that.", "8223 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. Thank you.", "8224 ", "UNDERTAKING ", "8225 MR. AUDET: And if I may, maybe one last comment, but maybe it\u2019s obvious, but you were asking about pricing. When we also support our customers, we're also presenting our price in bundle, because many, many times if you have services with TELUS for mobility and the voice and long distance, also your prices are a lot lower because every time you are adding product and services, you have rebates. ", "8226 So also, we are guiding our customers through that path, so it brings at the end of the day, their entire bill more affordable. ", "8227 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. Specific question as it relates to the deaf community; I think they spoke of themselves as \"culturally deaf\". ", "8228 MR. AUDET: M'hm. ", "8229 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That will be using VRS. They were speaking and actually the other part or panel that came before us as well were speaking of a desire to have wireless -- did only plans for wireless. ", "8230 Where are you folks on that? Do you provide that?", "8231 MR. WOODHEAD: No. We give a discount of $15. The -- one of the witnesses referenced the problem for Text 9-1-1 without a voice plan, so in respect of the fact that the voice component is less useful, obviously, to them, we provide a discount of $15 per month. ", "8232 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And you have no plan to change that? You have to be a registered user in -- I mean, it hasn\u2019t gone into place yet, VRS, so even with VRS, I mean, I think the other thing they were asking was for higher usage plans as well. ", "8233 MR. WOODHEAD: Well, okay.", "8234 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Are you looking -- let me ask --- ", "8235 MR. WOODHEAD: We --- ", "8236 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I've got a question and you can answer. Are you looking at designing any plans to meet the needs of those who will be using the VRS?", "8237 MR. WOODHEAD: It will be a new service and certainly we could look at doing something like that, but we have not. We felt that the $15 discount in respect to the voice plan seemed to realize the issue, and --- ", "8238 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So what information would you need to look at that? ", "8239 MR. WOODHEAD: To look at?", "8240 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, you said, \"Well, we felt that giving them $15 off would probably be sufficient to meet their needs,\" and I think the people in front of us said they didn\u2019t -- their entire issue wasn\u2019t that they had to buy voice with data; their other issue was the data packages on the mobility plans simply would not be sufficient for their needs or they were very costly, given that that would be their sole means of communications.", "8241 MR. WOODHEAD: Through VRS?", "8242 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Through VRS. ", "8243 MR. WOODHEAD: I would -- I mean, I would suggest -- I'd actually was -- I was having difficulty understanding that particular aspect, because the VRS application, as I understand it, doesn\u2019t require -- when we trialled it, I think it ran on -- it ran into 156 kilobit streams.", "8244 And then I believe I saw one calculation; I believe it was from the VRS administrator that sort of grossed it up for this and that and the other thing and said it would need 700 kilobits.

WOODHEAD: Yes, absolutely.", "8332 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "8333 I was struck by Richard Schultz\u2019 comments in paragraphs 28 and 29 of your oral presentation, which sort of concluded in paragraph 29 \u201cif these parties want to\u2026\u201d -- you were -- you\u2019re saying you\u2019re talking about universal service and that sort of stuff, but it was the comment: ", "8334 \u201cIf these parties want to justify their proposals instead of relying on a false restatement of the history of universal service, they instead need to look at what they will do, how they will implement it and what it will cost and they need to demonstrate that the economic and social benefits exceed the economic costs.\u201d ", "8335 Now I\u2019m not exactly sure that\u2019s precisely who you were aiming at there. It\u2019s -- it comes across as a little bit of a drive-by shooting.", "8336 But I will refer -- because some groups last week from the north referred to the Northern Communications Information Systems working group report, which is -- the \u201cArctic Communications Infrastructure of the 21st Century\u201d is the report.", "8337 And that, as I recall, because I observed at some of the meetings on it was chaired by the Department of National Defense and involved a number of stakeholders throughout the region which DND admirably herded into one room. ", "8338 And I just want to read from you that like if this doesn\u2019t justify it the opening comments from their report which was titled \u201ca matter of survival\u201d.", "8339 \u201cThe Arctic must have reliable communications networks to establish and maintain Canada\u2019s sovereignty and to meet international obligations for ensuring safe passage for road, sea and air traffic.\u201d ", "8340 And it goes on and it talks about fundamentals of sovereignty, security and public safety. Are those not reasonable economic and social benefits that would require subsidy on the part of the people of Canada?", "8341 DR. SCHULTZ: Yes they are. Two questions -- two comments. There\u2019s nothing in my submission that denies the potential for subsidy.", "8342 The second point is that my introductory comments in this submission and my presentation were based on my reading of several of the initial submissions to the Commission.", "8343 And in particular the one from Dr. Winseck and the interrogatories and some of the comments in the submission from the Affordable Access Coalition; those were what I was referring to.", "8344 And my concern was, and it still holds, that -- excuse me, if we want to include basic broadband as a basic telecommunication service, we should justify that on its own merits and not under the guise of a traditional assumption of universal service. ", "8345 One of my concerns with them, with particularly Dr. Winseck\u2019s proposals, which gets us into a range of 10 to 50 billion, if I recall him correctly last week, and also the Affordable Access Coalition, is that they are proposing an implicit in going back to the original submission. ", "8346 It\u2019s based on the concept of just extending universal -- the traditional universal service objective. They\u2019re proposing what I would regard as an unprecedented adventure for the Commission into social policy engineering, in which they use a benign statement of a third party administrator when in fact they should be talking about either a third party or a CRTC administration that would develop criteria, monitor, verify, monitor the continued acceptability for people.", "8347 So that was my concern. It wasn\u2019t just a question in the north.", "8348 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Well, at least I know who you were shooting at now so thanks for clarifying.", "8349 I was also struck for a moment, and it may have been off the cuff so just correct me, Mr. Woodhead. You mentioned -- there was a couple of comments to my colleague Commissioner Molnar that said in your view there would always be pockets in Canada that were unserved and areas that would be unserved. ", "8350 And that might not be an unreasonable thing to say, but for us we don\u2019t actually get to think that way. Because the Telecommunications Act is very clear that we have to see to it that reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality are accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada are there. ", "8351 So just from our point of view, we have to work forward to fill in these gaps. And I\u2019d just like you to clarify again for me where you think we can be most effective in seeing to it or facilitating that those gaps are filled.", "8352 MR. WOODHEAD: Sure. So first point I think would be the telecom policy objectives are not just the CRTC\u2019s objectives, they\u2019re Canada\u2019s telecom policy objectives so various actors operate under them. ", "8353 But even under for plain old telephone service today, there are people that are not served. There are tariffs in place to deal with construction expenses beyond the end of the networks. And the obligation on the incumbent telephone company -- because we are the only ones today that hold an obligation in respect of any of this -- require that we absorb the first $2,500 of extension and the rest is up to the subscriber. So there are places in Canada today that get -- that don\u2019t have phone service. ", "8354 So that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at. I wasn\u2019t trying to be glib or sort of throw people under the bus. I\u2019m just saying that there may always be places where the cost of serving is, even with some subsidy scheme, that will not get service. ", "8355 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right, okay. That\u2019s in context because it is -- I mean, it\u2019s a stretch for us from time to time when you\u2019re listening at one end of the spectrum to people ---", "8356 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah, sure.", "8357 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- who don\u2019t understand ---", "8358 MR. WOODHEAD: I wasn\u2019t trying to be (inaudible) minded about it. I was just trying to ---", "8359 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- (inaudible) service. And meanwhile, very recently we were talking about system modernization in the north, and that involved getting call display in Gjoa Haven. So there\u2019s obviously some work to do.", "8360 I too was pleased, although somewhat surprised, to hear about your pilot project in terms of that and all the other parties who are working on it. I think it\u2019s really the first we\u2019d heard of it, which probably goes to some of the Chairman\u2019s remarks earlier today, but I\u2019ll leave that to him. I wouldn\u2019t want to prejudge.", "8361 When did that start?", "8362 MR. WOODHEAD: Us developing the pilot program?", "8363 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah.", "8364 MR. WOODHEAD: It was about three and a half years ago.", "8365 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So you didn\u2019t think -- I was just curious. Like, this process is now 15 months old and there\u2019s been a lot of affordability discussions as part of the discussions. So did you just miss it through the first couple of rounds? Because it would have been helpful. To be honest, it would have been a useful thing to talk to people about last week ---", "8366 MR. WOODHEAD: Right.", "8367 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- in terms of that.", "8368 MR. WOODHEAD: I mean, as I said, we\u2019re still working with the other parties to try and do a launch of it so I guess that was in part. And it wasn\u2019t -- I apologize, it wasn\u2019t an attempt to try and slip something in.", "8369 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah. No, that\u2019s fine.", "8370 And you talked about Alberta and B.C. and Quebec?", "8371 MR. WOODHEAD: No, we were doing it in Alberta and B.C. first.", "8372 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. And does it involve any discussions with the provinces of B.C. or Alberta?", "8373 MR. WOODHEAD: We actually have had discussions with both provinces of Alberta and B.C. One of the key problems -- and any of these kinds of things are going to suffer the same problems is -- I think I said it\u2019s the real problem, one of the real problems, is authentication and verification of the person at the threshold that whatever, you know, as we set it at this. It could be set somewhere else. That\u2019s a big problem.", "8374 And there are -- Canada -- there\u2019s a national program like this in the United States, which is where incidentally we got the idea for it in the first place. But there are -- Canada has a bit of an aversion to means testing for whatever reason historically. And in the United States they don\u2019t seem to have that. So they have a national school lunch program and it\u2019s operated sort of using them.", "8375 In Canada we don\u2019t have any kind of national program like that that we could use to determine that this person\u2019s family is below this income criteria. So then we went and started looking at the provinces. Then the problem I ran into was I could find similar means tested programs in the provinces but they were all different. ", "8376 So my objective -- and perhaps I was na\u00efve. My objective was to have a unitary national program set on some standardized criteria that every Canadian family in a situation below the threshold would have access to the exact same thing. And whether I was na\u00efve in that I don\u2019t know but in retrospect, you know, I just didn\u2019t want to have to add to the complexity of the program around setting different standards in different provinces. And it\u2019s as simple as that, Commissioner. ", "8377 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, I understand that. They\u2019re daunting.", "8378 But on that so when do you expect the pilot project to start?", "8379 MR. WOODHEAD: It\u2019s hard to say. We had hoped to announce it. Actually, we had a tentative launch date prior to the beginning of the hearing but that didn\u2019t work out. And then the budget intervened and because there\u2019s various departments involved in ---", "8380 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, so when?", "8381 MR. WOODHEAD: I would say by the end of this year.", "8382 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: By the end of this year?", "8383 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah. ", "8384 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks.", "8385 And I just want to follow through on my colleague\u2019s discussion with you about adoption. This isn\u2019t a request that you do this but this is a question. Do you think there\u2019s any reason why industry couldn\u2019t be a leader as well in searching for solutions for affordability?", "8386 MR. WOODHEAD: No, I think we\u2019re a relevant actor in it but I\u2019m not sure that we can solve it entirely ourselves. Much like, you know ---", "8387 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Do you think industry, I\u2019m not saying TELUS specifically; do you think industry can be a leader in that?", "8388 MR. WOODHEAD: I don\u2019t actually understand what you mean by \u201cleader.\u201d A leader in what, doing what particularly?", "8389 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Drive the initiative, like take the initiative and say, \u201cLook, we need a solution to affordability. We want all the companies and all the players to work together to find it.\u201d", "8390 MR. WOODHEAD: Well, that was part of the purpose of, as I said before, of the pilot would be to try and figure out what are the drivers of this.", "8391 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So the answer is yes?", "8392 MR. WOODHEAD: Potentially if -- you know, I thought I explained how I saw this.", "8393 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, I understood. I was just asking a shorter question.", "8394 MR. WOODHEAD: If yes is easier ---", "8395 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Is industry capable of taking the lead and helping address some of these issues --", "8396 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes.", "8397 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- of adopting the --", "8398 MR. WOODHEAD: That, you know ---", "8399 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- Commissioner Molnar raised adoptability. I\u2019m -- I mean affordability.", "8400 MR. WOODHEAD: You\u2019ve seen what Rogers has done. You\u2019ve heard about what we\u2019re doing. I think there\u2019s other -- actually, and maybe they\u2019ll talk about their own, others that are doing similar sorts of things. And, you know, if those are all driven by the industry without, you know, like outside of this hearing process, outside of any kind of government compulsion to do something, then I would say, yeah, that chances are good that the industry could come up with something.", "8401 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. And I understood your reasoning about coming back to us eventually on it, although I just wanted -- and I\u2019m only speaking for myself on it that, you know, you -- if people want to be kind to the poor, they don\u2019t need to come to us for permission. There\u2019s plenty of ---", "8402 MR. WOODHEAD: But if some people -- you\u2019ve heard from some providers last week that, you know, programs like this have a cost.", "8403 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah.", "8404 MR. WOODHEAD: And they may not feel, you know, it necessary for them to do it. And while a voluntary national program would be tom terrific, I\u2019m not sure that it would necessarily end up being national in that didn\u2019t meet my criteria for what a successful program --", "8405 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah. No, I get ---", "8406 MR. WOODHEAD: -- looks like.", "8407 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But there\u2019s a million different ways to do things. I mean, some of it can just be, I mean, volunteer-driven. I mean, there\u2019s -- I can -- small scale. Anyway, I won\u2019t get into it because it\u2019s -- it is clearly complex. I was just ---", "8408 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah.", "8409 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Great. I was just looking for your answer on whether you thought industry could be --", "8410 MR. SCHMIDT: I had one ---", "8411 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- could take on a leadership role.", "8412 MR. SCHMIDT: I\u2019d add one footnote to that, please. I mean, I -- we would probably have some competition law hesitation about providers sitting in the room talking prices that they\u2019re going to charge to the public. But we could get shelter from some of those concerns in a process convened or encouraged by the regulators.", "8413 No, I think there\u2019s merit to pursuing the idea. But it may, in fact, benefit from some shelter where the Commission is encouraging us to go forth and develop a solution or consider options and report back to us.", "8414 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I understand that the threat of conspiring to be charitable.", "8415 MR. SCHMIDT: Unfortunately.", "8416 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Ominous.", "8417 That\u2019s all from me. Thanks.", "8418 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner MacDonald?", "8419 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions and I\u2019ll preface this by saying I have no moral objection to TELUS and its shareholders turning a profit.", "8420 But I\u2019m looking at your annual report and my first question is around we talked earlier about how government funding such as Connected to Canadians gets prioritized and through a competitive bidding process for network upgrades in specific areas. But you also invest a lot of money on an annual basis in upgrading your own network for your own subscribers. ", "8421 And I\u2019m looking at your annual report last year and right above you talking about increasing your dividend you mention that you\u2019re investing a billion dollars over the next several years in Edmonton and Vancouver to roll out a fibre optic network.", "8422 Some may argue that those two communities are already reasonably well-served. So when you\u2019re sitting around the table at headquarters, what mental gymnastics do you go through to decide we want to spend our money here versus spending those investment dollars to close existing holes in your network, such as the ones we heard about earlier today on Pilkey Point Road or Mrs. Lowell that may love to avail of your services but you\u2019re choosing to spend $2 billion here versus relatively small amounts of money to fill in holes in your existing network?", "8423 MR. WOODHEAD: I\u2019ll let Eros start first. I can come back to the specific examples of Thetis Island and Ms. Lowell, if you want.", "8424 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: And I just cited that as an example because that\u2019s what we heard.", "8425 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah. No, fair enough.", "8426 MR. SPADOTTO: Commissioner, let me attempt to answer the question so, you know, in terms of trying to answer the mental gymnastics that go on in our company.", "8427 And the rest of the Commissioners have already heard me kind of speak in the past about this. But we really operate under what I would call an investment ladder. And, you know, the investment ladder starts at the bottom with making sure that we fulfill our, you know, legal and regulatory obligations and then climbs on top of that into making sure that we add capacity as required to our network, and then fundamentally goes into areas that some would consider to be optional in nature. And then how do you make those decisions where they\u2019re optional in nature?", "8428 And those decisions that are optional in nature are made in a -- in the view of the competitive marketplace. We have a very able and capable competitor in the form of Shaw that we have determined that in order to stay competitive with that competitor that we will have to bring fibre to many of our communities. And it is exactly that that causes us to make those decisions.", "8429 MR. WOODHEAD: And that -- if I may add because I -- and that is an exact function of a facilities-based platform competition policy. The greatest driver of these investments is this competition between different platforms.", "8430 And if I could just come back to -- because you pointed out, Commissioner, the Vancouver and Edmonton announcements. Last year if you look in the report, at the end of 2015 we completed 63 fibre communities. Some of these communities are not Vancouver and -- or all of them other than Vancouver, all other 63 are not obviously Vancouver and Edmonton. And some of them are very, very modest sized towns.", "8431 So I think Eros could attest that as we -- Vancouver and Edmonton was getting -- was after all of the smaller places we\u2019ve done. So that\u2019s -- I just wanted to say that. ", "8432 And then in terms of Thetis Island, we actually got Connecting Canadians funding for that. It was part of the announcement last week. That\u2019s the good news. So the ATM architecture will be updated to IP-DSLAM. ", "8433 The problem for Pilkey Road though will not be solved because there is -- the loops are too long and it is also at that location is served by a submarine -- loaded submarine cable. And the combination of those two things, the cost to actually service those 60 homes would have put in jeopardy the funding to upgrade the rest.", "8434 In terms of Ms. Lowell, we actually offered to provide Middle Point with fibre on the proviso that 80 percent of the community agree to each pay $500. The per home cost in that area was something -- it was several thousand dollars per home. And only 18 percent of the people there agreed. And that is, in fact, the reason why we haven\u2019t been able to do it.", "8435 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay. Thank you for that additional context.", "8436 And obviously, you\u2019re of the opinion that the current five and one speed targets are adequate. But I\u2019m looking at your website, and I\u2019m not saying that a 5 and 1 service isn\u2019t there and isn\u2019t offered, but the lowest speed I can find is internet 15. Fifteen (15) down, 1 up, which you describe as light usage, mostly email, surfing and use of social media for as a standalone product $63 a month.", "8437 Do you provide a five in one package in all of your markets? Or has five in one been replaced with larger packages where you can provide a more robust service?", "8438 MR. LANGDON: We offer a six meg -- one to six meg service everywhere we operate.", "8439 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: And is that promoted? Like I said, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not on your website, but I couldn\u2019t find it.", "8440 MR. LANGDON: Yeah. When you go to our website you can put in your address and it\u2019ll show you what you qualify for. You can also go into our sales channels or phone our call centre and they\u2019ll work you through that to get you the best available plan that meets your needs.", "8441 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: So that package is available across your network?", "8442 MR. LANGDON: You can order it today. ", "8443 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.", "8444 THE CHAIRPERSON: We\u2019re cutting to the end. So just a few more questions. And I\u2019ll shuffle them around because I think we may be losing our interpreters soon, but there are questions that may be of interest to the deaf community. ", "8445 Earlier you said you had a $15 discount for voice. What's the $15 discount, on what? ", "8446 MR. WOODHEAD: The monthly plan. ", "8447 THE CHAIRPERSON: Which is? Of how much? ", "8448 MR. WOODHEAD: I'm not sure. I don't know if -- Chris, do you know? ", "8449 MR. LANGDON: Yeah, we generally sell them as combined voice and data plans, so you can get $75 plans, so it would take you down to 60 or so, which approximates a data-only configuration. ", "8450 THE CHAIRPERSON: And is that $15 based on metrics that what would be a normal, standard voice versus data mix, or why did you just choose $15? ", "8451 MR. LANGDON: Yeah, it's competitive so we look at whenever we set prices, it's done on a competitive sort of context, so we look what's out there and that's approximated.", "8452 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, I'm not sure competitive is relevant in this case. It is a group of people that really don't use voice. One would think that you would logically and rationally look at what the normal usage of voice would be and say, \"Well, these folks don\u2019t use it; therefore, we discount it.\"", "8453 MR. LANGDON: I\u2019m sorry, is that your --- ", "8454 THE CHAIRPERSON: So why do you mention that it's a competitive issue? It's --- ", "8455 MR. LANDGON: Oh, not a -- so when we look at benchmark pricing, it's obviously done looking across carriers, and when we look at voice plans, like, on prepaid, it looks like it's about $15. That would be our determination and that's the discount. ", "8456 Could you help me? ", "8457 MR. WOODHEAD: The only -- I'm not sure I can. The only other possibility here is that there could be competitive data only plans that we're basing that off of. ", "8458 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you undertake to actually explain how you got to $15? ", "8459 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes. ", "8460 ", "UNDERTAKING", "8461 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. ", "8462 Do any of your customer service reps have the ability to serve the community, the deaf community in ASL or LSQ? ", "8463 MR. LANGDON: No, only through TTY.", "8464 THE CHAIRPERSON: And is that through an attempt that has failed or you just haven't thought about it? ", "8465 MR. LANGDON: We have -- certainly, when we think of needs of constituents, it's always something we take into consideration. At this point, we haven't delivered that sort of service.", "8466 THE CHAIRPERSON: Why not? ", "8467 MR. AUDET: But if I may, at TELUS Quebec we looked at it, and it was very too complex, because there are different languages and --- ", "8472 MR. WOODHEAD: If I may, Mr. Chair, just to clarify what Mr. Langdon said, I -- we certainly are not using IP relay to do any of this yet, but there may well be people in our stores who actually sign, can sign, but it, you know, it's not -- I -- because somebody had mentioned on one of --- ", "8473 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you're not aware of them?", "8474 MR. WOODHEAD: No, sir. ", "8475 THE CHAIRPERSON: I would have thought that would have been a competitive advantage, at least for a large portion of the Canadian population that might say, \"Well, TELUS, great. They do that for us. Let's all, as a community, recognize that TELUS is doing good things.\"", "8476 MR. WOODHEAD: It may well be. ", "8477 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you haven't thought about it yet?

Nous savons que TELUS Qu\u00e9bec a un historique \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 TELUS plus large qui est un peu diff\u00e9rente et puis \u00e9videmment le territoire est particulier.

Je voulais vous poser la question d\u2019une fa\u00e7on plus large.", "8492 THE CHAIRPERSON: Perhaps I can turn now to the programs that we've discussed, the past ones and the future ones, Connecting Canadians, that exist. ", "8493 I take it that the new terms and conditions for the new program are not known; is that correct? ", "8494 MR. WOODHED: No. Oh, sorry, yes, that is correct.", "8495 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, okay. So we don\u2019t know them yes, okay. ", "8496 And -- but we do know the terms and conditions of the previous programs?", "8497 MR. WOODHEAD: Correct. ", "8498 THE CHAIRPERSON: To my knowledge, they're not on the public record, those terms and conditions?", "8499 MR WOODHEAD: I don't think they are, no. ", "8500 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would it be possible for you to actually put them onto a public record? ", "8501 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes, we have, yes. When you say terms and conditions --- ", "8502 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm sure that behind the terms and conditions that are public of any government -- federal Government of Canada's --- ", "8503 MR. WOODHEAD: The memoranda of understanding?", "8504 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, so it's -- but there must be a program you apply to?", "8505 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes, there's an application form --- ", "8506 THE CHAIRPERSON: Which sets out criteria and considerations? I'm talking about the general, not your specific agreements.", "8507 And presumably behind that there is a -- probably a memorandum to Cabinet and probably a submission to the Treasury Board Secretariat, but you would not have access to that, so I'm not asking for that. I'm asking for the public --- ", "8508 MR. WOODHEAD: There all of those things, but I don\u2019t have any of those. ", "8509 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, of course. ", "8510 Do you know if it's -- would you describe -- there's two types of general government grants and contribution programs. Well, first of all, is it a grant or is it a contribution? ", "8511 MR. WOODHEAD: It's a contribution. ", "8512 THE CHAIRPERSON: And is it based, the criteria, on a formulaic application or is it a selective program? ", "8513 MR. WOODHEAD: I'm not certain I understand the difference in these things. ", "8514 THE CHAIRPERSON: For instance, the Canada Media Fund, based on certain formula, you're entitled to a percentage of an envelope; that's one thing. There are other programs that a decision and discretion must be --- ", "8515 MR. WOODHEAD: There's discretion.", "8516 THE CHAIRPERSON: So it's a selective program --- ", "8517 MR. WOODHEAD: Correct.", "8518 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- based on --- ", "8519 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes. ", "8520 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- probably a competitive entry that several -- you apply and --- ", "8521 MR. WOODHEAD: As I described, the -- whoever can basically serve the biggest number of homes at possibly the cheapest cost. ", "8522 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, but somebody applies a discretion because it\u2019s not a formula based.", "8523 MR. WOODHEAD: Correct.", "8524 THE CHAIRPERSON: To your knowledge, where is that discretion exercised? For grants and contribution programs, it\u2019s possible -- I noticed for instance in La Presse recently de Mme Joly, made a very wise decision of making sure grants and contributions at certain levels are exercised at a lower level. It has the advantage of reducing administrative costs for grants and contributions and, as well, ensures that there is less risk of political interference in decisions.", "8525 So what is your understanding of the \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d program? Is it one that is administered at the director -- DG Adm level or is it one that requires a ministerial distribution?", "8526 MR. WOODHEAD: I personally have met with the DG and the director, and I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an Adm responsible solely for that program. But there would be -- it\u2019s probably the Adm of Telecom Policy, I believe.", "8527 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, but I\u2019m asking where the decision point is, to your knowledge; do you know?", "8528 MR. WOODHEAD: I think -- no. I believe they make recommendations and those recommendations might be made to the minister\u2019s office, but that\u2019s my total speculation.", "8529 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Well, we\u2019ll take it as just total speculation at this point. I thought perhaps you knew.", "8530 MR. WOODHEAD: I\u2019m happy to find out but ---", "8531 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, perhaps somebody else will be able to add to our record down the road.", "8532 I would like to share with you what we\u2019ll call Exhibit 4, CRTC Exhibit 4. So the secretary is going to give it to you.", "8533 And essentially, as you can see -- Mr. Woodhead, you get a lot of things thrown at you today but you know, in another life, you used to work for me. So I know you are able to absorb it.", "8534 So Exhibit 4 tries to set out some prices of residential broadband internet access services. Granted, it\u2019s based on 2014 information and it\u2019s focusing on 24 urban centres across Canada.", "8535 You\u2019ll see behind -- next to each name of the cities there is a number there, which represents our understanding of the number of service providers in those particular cities, as we understood it in 2014.", "8536 Now, I did hear your testimony earlier, which suggests that maybe our pricing information may be inaccurate in terms of your lowest available price. But you\u2019ll see in the blue there, it\u2019s the lowest price and then there are variances for highest to lowest.", "8537 And I was wondering if, based on this document, you would agree with me that there seems to be an uneven distribution across the country.", "8538 MR. WOODHEAD: I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat the last bit there?", "8539 THE CHAIRPERSON: That if you look in the various regions, there seems to be similarity in Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary and Edmonton. Then, there\u2019s another bundle of -- I\u2019m not even sure if these are similar; there\u2019s Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg. ", "8540 Then, there\u2019s a lot of commonality from Hamilton to Windsor; and another bundle of Montreal and Quebec. ", "8541 And then, there\u2019s the Atlantic Provinces, yes, Atlantic, I said it right; and then, there\u2019s the North.", "8542 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes.", "8543 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you agree with me that there\u2019s actually quite a variance from one place to the next?", "8544 MR. WOODHEAD: Well, I think there is until you get to -- there is not -- to the -- not. I mean, I suppose, quite a variance -- there\u2019s quite a variance between Iqaluit and Vancouver, yes.", "8545 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, but I was subdividing them. Obviously, there\u2019s something going in Iqaluit that\u2019s quite different. We\u2019ve spent some time at the hearing on that. Let\u2019s put that aside, and maybe Yellowknife and Whitehorse as well.", "8546 But for the rest, there seems to be considerable variation, if nothing else, between the West and the Atlantic Provinces.", "8547 Does that surprise you as an outcome? Should there be that much variation across the country?", "8548 MR. WOODHEAD: Not necessarily. I mean, it could be -- it could be density. It could be cost. It could be all kinds of things.", "8549 I -- I must say I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not really familiar -- I mean, I\u2019m familiar geographically and I\u2019ve been to these places, but I\u2019m not familiar with the sort of structure in the Atlantic Provinces and why those might vary so much from the rest in terms of the lowest and the highest.", "8550 But the other -- until you get to the Maritimes, it looks fairly -- fairly consistent to me.", "8551 THE CHAIRPERSON: You consider 49 -- sorry, 25, 27 -- I mean, these are -- these are without taxes, I believe, too.", "8552 MR. WOODHEAD: Oh, sorry, are you asking me the variations between highest and lowest price ---", "8553 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, both the lowest and the highest. There seems to be quite a diversity of -- in the blue boxes as well as in the red boxes.", "8554 MR. WOODHEAD: Well, I mean I guess it depends on what -- and I\u2019m not trying to be difficult -- it depends on what you view as a significant diversity.", "8555 I mean, I don\u2019t particularly view pricing between 25 and $30 to be -- and there\u2019s -- many in the lower tier there are now 25 and 50. But again, I don\u2019t -- you know, Saskatoon ---", "8556 THE CHAIRPERSON: It may make a considerable difference, $5 a month, on somebody who is in the low end of the affordability spectrum. Would you not agree?", "8557 MR. WOODHEAD: It may.", "8558 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "8559 You\u2019ve just ---", "8560 MR. WOODHEAD: That\u2019s with any other service.", "8561 THE CHAIRPERSON: Absolutely. I take your point with that.", "8562 Now that you\u2019ve just gotten this, so perhaps you would be willing to take an undertaking to do a more deep analysis of this exhibit and extrapolate from it what it teaches us, if anything, in terms of setting a future looking \u201cblueprint\u201d, to use your word, if anything? Perhaps you think that it is not probative at all.", "8563 MR. WOODHEAD: What it tells me is there\u2019s a problem in Iqaluit, just off the top of my head but ---", "8564 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. Well, I think we\u2019ve all figured that one out already.", "8565 You mentioned in your -- but would you be able to do that undertaking?", "8566 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes.", "8567 ", "UNDERTAKING", "8568 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "8569 You mentioned in your presentation tax policy. Now, if I\u2019m not mistaken, Mr. Woodhead, you are more responsible for federal government relations?", "8570 MR. WOODHEAD: Correct.", "8571 THE CHAIRPERSON: In your company, is there somebody who is specifically responsible for provincial government relations or is that distributed or how is that ---", "8572 MR. WOODHEAD: It\u2019s distributed.", "8573 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So in light of that double responsibility, could you help me understand if anybody in your organization, whether you or other members of leadership, have advocated privately or even publicly for tax policy to specifically address the affordability concerns we\u2019ve heard about low income Canadians?", "8574 MR. WOODHEAD: Tax policy changes to deal with affordability?", "8575 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "8576 MR. WOODHEAD: Beyond my dealings with CRA on the program to try and see if there was a way that we could, you know, have the information transferred to another government department about who might qualify for child -- Canada child benefit, no.", "8577 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, because there are pre-budget consultations that occur federally and in a number of provinces as well. And I was wondering if you thought -- because you\u2019ve advocated for it.", "8578 MR. WOODHEAD: We advocated for an accelerated capital cost allowance in the pre-budget consultation.", "8579 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. I\u2019m talking about affordability here.", "8580 MR. WOODHEAD: Well, I mean, if ---", "8581 THE CHAIRPERSON: In terms of your specific ---", "8582 MR. WOODHEAD: If the -- if the service, if the service can be made cheaper as a result of that, that actually probably ---", "8583 THE CHAIRPERSON: As a trickle-down to -- but I was specifically asking for low income and more vulnerable, you have no ---", "8584 MR. WOODHEAD: No, Mr. Chairman.", "8585 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar asked you to -- because again, we perhaps surprised you with a change of direction that maybe address what she described as -- what you described as a \u201cblueprint\u201d for the future. You know, there are different words to talk about a bigger picture, collaborative approach to a number of issues.", "8586 And then you talked about what kinds of initiatives the industry could lead or not lead. ", "8587 I often think of sometimes -- and you mentioned the discoverability summit. And I described that as being the Commission using its convening power. ", "8588 And I appreciate there may be some legal considerations, although if you want me to invite Mr. Peckman to protect you from any accusations I\u2019m more than happy to do that if we are the convening power. ", "8589 But I was wondering, when you give that answer of potential specific actions you of course can think about the Commission or other government entities using their convening power. But I invite you as well to consider other using, for instance, the private sector, using their convening power. ", "8590 MR. WOODHEAD: And as you\u2019ll recall, before Commissioner Molnar turned it around on me, the way I started that actual answer was to say that the Commission could call for a cross-departmental that could even include the industry. And then we went at it the other way but either way works. But yes, I undertake to provide that.", "8591 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Well, the reality is that this is not cross-examination. It\u2019s an exchange. And that allows you to reposition your answers.", "8592 MR. WOODHEAD: Oh, I was just getting dizzy.", "8593 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah. So and again, when you -- and maybe you want to start addressing the point of blueprint and, you know, where do we want to get. I, perhaps with my public policy background, but I tend to talk about outcomes. What outcomes would we want in a collaborative model that I set out earlier today just before the lunch break?", "8594 MR. WOODHEAD: To be honest with you, I don\u2019t know. And the reason I don\u2019t know is because I think it will depend to a great extent on what your findings and determinations are in this hearing in terms of the context of what is a very broad area of ground that you have covered here.", "8595 THE CHAIRPERSON: You see, I would have thought it\u2019s the other way around. That when you set large national objectives you start off defining the outcomes and then you -- which is the strategy -- and then you define specific actions required. But you actually have to figure out what the outcome is and then work backwards.", "8596 MR. WOODHEAD: See, I don\u2019t look at it that way. I look at it that let\u2019s see what the evidence says and is there a problem?", "8597 THE CHAIRPERSON: Oh, granted.", "8598 MR. WOODHEAD: Don\u2019t presume an outcome.", "8599 THE CHAIRPERSON: I take your point. But you have to do an analysis of strengths and weaknesses and all that. ", "8600 But given all that, once you\u2019ve done your environmental scanning and your assessment of the current state and the capacity, one normally then sets okay this is our goal, this is what we\u2019re trying to achieve.", "8601 MR. WOODHEAD: Okay. ", "8602 THE CHAIRPERSON: And then you take specific actions to achieve that over a period of time, and the actions could involve, you know, a basket of initiatives from convening to spend to tax policy to a variety of things.", "8603 MR. WOODHEAD: Right. Okay, so ---", "8604 THE CHAIRPERSON: (Inaudible) a bit too big a question at 5:23 after a long day.", "8605 MR. WOODHEAD: No, not at all. Not at all. ", "8606 The one example that I would give you in here is around this program that we\u2019ve had little conversations with various Commissioners about. To me I had an outcome in mind of that program, or we did, TELUS did. And because it appeared to me that it would -- the evidence seemed to show that there were a variety of drivers. We just don\u2019t know which ones are which and which ones are the most effective so that was an outcome.", "8607 But by the same token, and it kind of goes to where we were having this conversation, our view and my view is that broadband actually -- the state of broadband in this country, is quite good and that prices for most people are reasonable. Others may disagree of course but ---", "8608 THE CHAIRPERSON: And that\u2019s what these processes are about.", "8609 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah. ", "8610 THE CHAIRPERSON: But based on your understanding and your analysis I think we would benefit from your take on the blueprint, to use your words.", "8611 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah, absolutely.", "8612 THE CHAIRPERSON: And what the objective is.", "8613 MR. WOODHEAD: I think I already took an undertaking but I\u2019ll take another one to do that.", "8614 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, it\u2019s -- I\u2019m just building on that. I\u2019m building on that undertaking that ---", "8615 MR. WOODHEAD: Yes, I already gave.", "8616 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, I know that. But what I\u2019m asking you to specifically address on top of what you already discussed with Commissioner Molnar is what are the outcomes?", "8617 MR. WOODHEAD: M\u2019hm. ", "8618 THE CHAIRPERSON: Not the CRTC outcomes but the national outcomes ---", "8619 MR. WOODHEAD: What are the things that are for the common good and of public benefit?", "8620 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "8621 MR. WOODHEAD: Yeah. ", "8622 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, and I have against private good either. I mean, those -- we do live in a open market society so that\u2019s not a bad thing. So if you could think about what are we trying to achieve over \u201cX\u201d period of time. And that might be a richer way and then talk ---", "8623 MR. WOODHEAD: And that\u2019s an important ---", "8624 THE CHAIRPERSON: Based on your ---", "8625 MR. WOODHEAD: That\u2019s an important addition to time scale because ---", "8626 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah. ", "8627 MR. WOODHEAD: --- what can be accomplished in a year is different than what can be accomplished in ---", "8628 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Because if we had followed through to solving child poverty in this country over 10 years we would have done it already, which we haven\u2019t, right, so ---", "8629 MR. WOODHEAD: Correct.", "8630 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- we have to be realistic and pragmatic as well. ", "8631 Those were my questions. I\u2019m looking over to legal. Lucky for you you do not have questions from legal after being on the stand for that period of time. So thank you very much. ", "8632 That completes our questions. ", "8633 MR.

And thank you for inviting us for this opportunity to present.", "8642 The purpose of our presentation is to first give you an overview of deaf people, people who are hard of hearing or have a hearing loss, to give you statistics, to give you an explanation of various kinds of captioning, to demonstrate a video telephone caption service, and to provide our recommendations specifically for basic services such as caption phone services, VRS, affordable data plans across Canada, and accurate high quality online captioning.", "8643 Speaking to statistics in general, according to the 2015 stats from Stats Can the aging population is increasing and so is the population of aging seniors with hearing loss. Between the ages of 70 and 79, 65 percent of that age group have a hearing loss. ", "8644 In general, Canada and the U.S. have similar studies for young people. One in five have a hearing loss, mostly because of loud noises, music in particular, using headphones. It\u2019s one of the fastest growing reasons for hearing loss.

", "8645 In general, the population tends to use text more than they use phone. There seems to be quite an increased use in text. And that\u2019s great. People with hearing loss are also using more text but they\u2019re also using more captioned telephone services, especially in the United States.", "8646 Hard of hearing people tend to watch video with captions; that is increasing. For the deaf, the tendency is to use more videos such as FaceTime, Skype, YouTube, VRS. Text is increasing as well. But there\u2019s use of course of the TTY.", "8647 In terms of the benefits of captioning to improve understanding, there\u2019s a great benefit to captioning. It helps in communicating your message to the culturally deaf, hard of hearing, oral deaf, and deafened. And new Canadians or people who are just learning English can follow captions. People with learning disabilities or other disabilities can also benefit from captions. And it also helps in complicated ideas. If you\u2019re not familiar with a vocabulary in hearing it you can see the captioned words. ", "8648 Universal design makes sure that captions should be available anywhere. For example, public spaces like an elevator to have a captioned message screen. In waiting rooms you might have a TV screen with messages. In cafeterias, noisy bars, or restaurants, more and more people are watching for the captioned message. Online courses, meetings, or other information that you might get through video is increasing. ", "8649 Live streaming in classrooms with captioning is increasing. Also, public announcement systems. For example, in the subway we have captions, public announcements. Every TV in many cafeterias and restaurants are showing more and more captions. ", "8650 There are two different kinds of captions. One, live captions; two, pre-recorded media captioning. Live captions include CART, the CART service, on site or remote; either one. From speech to text on the CART you\u2019ll see it real time. You\u2019ll see it for TV, movies, announcements, meetings.", "8651 Something has disappeared off my computer screen.", "8652 --- (A short pause/Courte pause)", "8653 UNKNOWN SPEAKER: He can continue; I\u2019ll set it up.", "8654 MR. MALKOWSKI: Can we wait until we get the technical support?", "8655 THE CHAIRPERSON: If that\u2019s your preference, yes. We have time.", "8656 UNKNOWN SPEAKER: The clock is not running.", "8657 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not counting this against your allotted time.", "8658 MR. MALKOWSKI: Okay. ", "--- (SHORT PAUSE)", "8659 All right, thank you for your patience with our technical difficulties. We\u2019re back on now. ", "8660 So there are two different kinds of captions. ", "8661 First is the live captioning and the second is the pre-recorded media captioning. ", "8662 Live captioning tends to be the CART service, onsite, and you can see it on the screen, or from a remote location and you see it on the same screen.", "8663 You can use it in a meeting room, for TV movies, classrooms, announcements; those kinds of things use that type of captioning. ", "8664 For pre-recorded, you can have closed or open captions and it's for pre-recorded scripts; for example, YouTube, DVDs, those sorts of things. ", "8665 Quality is very important. High quality is our number one importance in terms of priority. Live broadcasts online, meetings, et cetera are at --disadvantage people who are watching. Webinars online do not meet the WGCAG 2.0, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. ", "8666 MS. BAINE: Online auto captioning services are often inaccurate, and inaccurate captioning leads to misinformation, misrepresentation, and in some cases, can be done in an offensive and ridiculing manner. ", "8667 We have compiled three examples today to demonstrate firsthand how captioning inaccuracies lead to misinformation. ", "8668 On a YouTube video, for a meeting an Art Gallery on Ontario artist-in-residence, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Havre, he's referring to, in a French accent, all of this big shapes and it was unfortunately, captioned into, \"own this pig,\" which was a bit of a ridiculing caption.", "8669 Three years ago, on April 15th, 2013, the Boston Marathon bomber, his real name is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and unfortunately, it was inaccurately captioned to read as \"Zooey Deschanel\", who is a celebrity and musical artist.", "8670 And then finally, we have an example of the formal -- former leader of the Liberal Party, Dalton McGuinty introducing himself as Dolphin McGuinty. ", "8671 MR. MALKOWSKI: The CRTC, in reference to today's technology -- you need to update your approach to meet the needs of the community and improve the technology. Canada is far behind compared to the United States in terms of technology development for captioning.", "8672 There's a Captioning Act in the United States. There isn't one in Canada. The legislation doesn\u2019t exist yet. ", "8673 It's a telecommunication technology that has really taken off in the United States. They have next generation 9-1-1; they have captioning as required; they have a Disability Rights Office; they have staff who are deaf and hard of hearing and other persons with disabilities who are involved in the FCC, and that's because of the legislation. And it has increased the technology. ", "8674 In Canada, we are still using Voice Carryover, which is out-of-date technology. The hardware is becoming obsolet. The federal -- the FCC has already approved captioned phone services in the United States. It's been in existence since 2003. ", "8675 MS. BAINE: So currently in Canada, people with hearing loss have very great difficulty communicating over the phone. This does lead to isolation and loneliness. You'll notice people are slowly disconnecting from their friends and family. This leads to a lack of independence, unfair for the individual as well as family, friends, and caregivers.", "8676 And it becomes a matter of -- an issue of safety, so what if there's a medical emergency? What if there's a break-in and they're unable to communicate without going through a slower service such as the Voice Carryover and having to connect with an operator? ", "8677 The captioned telephone service that we're proposing allows people who are hard of hearing to easily and independently place and receive calls.", "8678 As you know, Canada will be implementing the Video Relay Service in the fall of this year and this service will provide telecommunication access to deaf individuals. ", "8679 Captioned Telephone Service is the equivalent of the VRS; however, CTS provides telecommunication access to hard of hearing, oral deaf, and deafened individuals. ", "8680 So how does the captioned telephone work? It's quite simple. It works with a standard telephone; however, in addition to the incoming audio, users are able to read what is being said in real time. ", "8681 Connection requirements are simple, simply a phone line and a high speed internet connection, and once in use, the phone is automatically connected behind the scenes to a caption service, which provides the captions using a speech recognition software. There is also a live operator who is going to be correcting any errors that are taking place. ", "8682 We'd like to do for you a live demonstration of how the captioned telephone service works so you're able to see. And we'll just zoom in on that. ", "8683 (DEMONSTRATION OF A CAPTIONING PROGRAM FOR THE DEAF VIA TELEPHONE)", "8684 Hi Alex, this is Melanie calling. How are you? ", "8685 I'm good thanks, how are you? ", "8686 Oh, well, I'm sorry to have missed that and I'm definitely going to be joining you on the next adventure. So I'll be calling you later on and we can set up another date. ", "8687 Great, thanks, Alex. I'll talk to you soon. Bye.", "8688 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just for the purpose of the transcript, let me describe what happened so that later on we have a good record of that, because those of us in the room may have seen it and those watching live, but it won't be in the transcript.", "8689 So we could see the person you were conversing with. We could see what they were \"saying\" through the captioned text and we could see that on the screen and of course, on the transcript, we heard you responding, so that -- I don\u2019t need to go through that. So thank you. ", "8690 MS. BAINE: Yes, and just to reiterate, so currently right now with the VCO service, what you have to do is pick up the phone, dial the 1-800 number, ask to be connected to the caller. So it's a bit of a process, and you're well aware that there is an operator, a third party, on the line. And you're kind of missing that personal aspect of the phone call.", "8691 So with the automated captioning service that's behind the scenes, it's virtually invisible and it really helps engage the phone calls and just make it how it should be. ", "8692 MR. MALKOWSKI: The CRTC needs to consider including basic essential telecommunication services such as the following: Video Relay Services; captioned telephone services, as Melanie just demonstrated; affordable internet access to various -- to carry video data; an option to substitute your voice minutes into data so that deaf and hard of hearing people are not paying for unused voice minutes. Internet access needs to be available to the same degree in all areas of Canada. They should be capable to have -- handle video data usage. For example, as you know, VRS is coming. A mobile device has a limited data plan and so the maximum usage for video will obviously go over and we\u2019ll be paying more. Deaf people tend to use the video and the data there is going to cost them more.", "8693 There needs to be universal standards for video and captioning platforms. For example, voice on phone -- all phones, no matter what type, are compatible with phones. Your BlackBerry can phone an iPhone. They\u2019re compatible. ", "8694 For video, the iPhone is not compatible to a BlackBerry. They\u2019re just not compatible. The BlackBerry is not compatible with FaceTime. FaceTime is not compatible with Skype. You have to have Skype to skype to be compatible. FaceTime to FaceTime. But FaceTime does not -- is not compatible with Skype. A Samsung device, an android device, for example, they\u2019re not compatible amongst themselves perhaps. ", "8695 So I think we should have a universal platform to make, regardless of your device, compatible so that FaceTime and Skype can be compatible to each other regardless.", "8696 The platform, there is not universal captioning as well. Voice has that. So we should -- you should consider having signed video and captioned compatible platform.", "8697 Professional and accurate captioning online is very important. For example, a webcast, live news. Remember the attack on Parliament Hill. There was live news. Everybody heard it but it wasn\u2019t captioned. Ottawa was shut down and we didn\u2019t know what was going on. There was no information.", "8698 Live news tends not to be captioned. They tend to add captions later. But we should have live captioning.", "8699 Internet based video should be live captioned. Public announcement systems should have live captions. If there\u2019s an emergency happening it should be captioned. It should be there. ", "8700 And sign for emergency announcements. That\u2019s something we\u2019re going to discuss at a further meeting when you talk about the topic of 9-1-1.", "8701 Again, I want to thank you for giving us this opportunity to present this morning.", "8702 MS. BAINE: Thank you.", "8703 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you very much. I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Vice-Chairman Menzies to start off the questions.", "8704 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you for your presentation. I\u2019ve just changed my mind about the questions I\u2019m going to ask so. ", "8705 I mean, I\u2019d like to go through your recommendations, if we can, starting with video relay service.", "8706 So I want -- what I\u2019d like to know is what difference it would make making video relay service a basic telecommunication service as opposed to where it is right now, where it\u2019s intended to be universally available where internet -- where the internet service can provide for it. Why do we need to do more than we\u2019ve done already?", "8707 MR. MALKOWSKI: It\u2019s important to recognize persons who are deaf and hard of hearing who use sign language, but also persons who do not speak but who are non-verbal but and also use sign. ", "8708 There are many hearing children of deaf parents to -- who need to communicate with their parents. There\u2019s an increased number of hearing babies who are using sign. There are more people in general who are interested in using sign. Persons who\u2019d like to become interpreters. ASL English or LSQ French, there\u2019s an increasing number. The technology is available. ", "8709 And so it\u2019s important to have access to communication. It\u2019s a Human Rights Act legal obligation for accessibility. And as the endorsement of the United Nations Declaration for Persons with Disabilities, we need to recognize people who are deaf, who need VRS through sign. They need relay. They need faster, comfortable service. ", "8710 As you know, TTYs are very slow. It\u2019s very time consuming. We need to be compatible with technology. VRS is going to be a benefit for all Canadians. ", "8711 Hearing people who want to communicate with the deaf, it will open more doors. It will increase functional equality.", "8712 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. What I was trying to get at was -- I understand all that. What I was trying to get at was why we need to do -- I mean, we\u2019ve already got VRS on the way. And as the decision stated, it was for the benefit of all Canadians, not just so that people using sign could talk to each other and their family, but so that all the rest of us could connect to that world too.", "8713 But what I don\u2019t understand is why we would have to create -- whether it would -- I don\u2019t understand what difference it would make if we made it part of basic telecommunication service.", "8714 I understand its benefits, for sure. But I don\u2019t understand what more you\u2019re asking for.", "8715 MR. MALKOWSKI: VRS and captioned telephone services should be together. They are basic services. The video -- VRS is life and death issue in many ways. Communication is very important to your everyday life. Relative to employment it\u2019s essential to have VRS. ", "8716 Captioned telephone services are also very important and they\u2019re not available in Canada. We should give those two as options as the basic telecommunication service.", "8717 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you.", "8718 On the captioned telephone service, I am trying to understand why that is necessary if we have VRS and if -- and many people have cell phone connectivity. The number of land lines in the country is in steady decline. I think there\u2019s about 10 million of them and there\u2019s 27 million cell phone subscribers. What does captioned telephone services bring that texting doesn\u2019t?", "8719 MR. MALKOWSKI: For immediate communication in an emergency situation, the CTS, caption television -- telephone service is -- makes it more comfortable to deal with a crisis, suicide crisis, counselling management issues. For quick communication that\u2019s important and would work. Aboriginal population, for example, with hearing losses, they need mental health prevention services. Any population, in fact, needs to be able to communicate immediately. ", "8720 We have to recognize persons who are deaf and hard of hearing, who are deaf and oral, they have very different communication needs to those who use sign language. It's people who use sign language who will be using VRS.", "8721 On the portable device, of course you can read the captioned -- you can -- it's compatible with the captioned telephone service or VRS. So your mobile device will be able to use both and I think for the whole population, we need to have both. We have VRS and the captioned telephone service. It will reduce frustration, reduce the time consumption as well.", "8722 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks.", "8723 Do you have any data on whether that's a significant cost or not? There's about $50 million I think was set aside for VRS and I'm just trying to get a sense of where captioned telephone services fit into that or whether it's just the availability of the phone or obviously the system.", "8724 MR. MALKOWSKI: We need to -- we have a feasibility study for VRS. We have that but we don\u2019t have any information relative to the feasibility study for the captioned telephone service. We would need to find out more information through the CTS cost, the actual American cost for running that service.", "8725 We should possibly establish a feasibility study to find out the exact cost of the CTS. We don\u2019t have specific data to answer your question. I would be happy to get that information and respond later.", "8726 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. If you would undertake to do that and follow up with us by May 5th, we'd appreciate that.", "8727 ", "UNDERTAKING", "8728 MR. MALKOWSKI: I will do that certainly.", "8729 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thanks.", "8730 When you say affordable internet access, you're referring to being able to carry video data.", "8731 What do you see as -- how do you define affordability?", "8732 MR. MALKOWSKI: I\u2019ll give you an example. Access to the IP relay service, you have to have a landline. So in order to set up an account, you have to pay and you're paying for your landline and you're paying for your mobile device because they won't recognize and accept your mobile phone number. You have to have the landline. So you're paying more.", "8733 High-speed internet options, for example, there's the video data cost that's higher, the memory data. And the unused voice service, you're still charged for that.", "8734 Bell Canada, Rogers, TELUS, they have a package and the cost is high. You have to make sure that it's affordable. The memory, the data, is the biggest problem. It's a huge usage for video to use your data.", "8735 If you want equivalent information, voice uses a little width, somewhat comparable to text, but the same message in video is a much higher cost for the same message and deaf people are using the video. So it means there's a much larger usage of data.", "8736 As you know all of course, VRS is coming soon. People will use their mobile devices for that and the cost is going to increase. It's going to be more for them to use it.", "8737 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Let me ask it this way. TELUS referred to a $15 adjustment that they make for qualifying individuals regarding accessibility issues.", "8738 Do you think that's appropriate?", "8739 MR. MALKOWSKI: If you look at it in study Deaf Wireless Canada report, in that report, the research survey gathered is good. I support what they found.", "8740 I have seen many clients who come and use our CHS services, interpreting mental health services, employment services, and they are all very frustrated with the high usage -- the high cost and $15 is really not comparable. It's going to cost a lot more. I think data usage will be a lot more than $15 would compensate.", "8741 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. The next question, you suggested that basic speed levels should be 15 down and 15 up. That's not the same as but it's consistent with other representations.", "8742 TELUS yesterday said they would get back to us but that they felt those sorts of upload speeds were not feasible I guess. I'm putting words in their mouth but that's the way I understood it.", "8743 Why do you think those sorts of upload speeds are necessary?", "8744 MR. MALKOWSKI: According to the research in general, it says that the best quality of video you will notice sometimes there's a bit of a blur depending on your WiFi, depending on traffic, depending on the quality. You know, sometimes you\u2019ll get the little fade in and out, the jitter.", "8745 We use a call centre. We use VRI and their recommendation is that to have their technology work well, the 15/15 is the best. We could go with 10/10. The quality is still good but truly the best for people who are visual, who need to see a very clear image, the 15/15. Ten/ten (10/10) would be an average. That would be okay but if you want the best with the less interference, then the 15/15 is what we recommend.", "8746 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "8747 I'm struggling a bit to get my head around your ask for captioning for online video content, not in terms of understandable need for it for your community but as to exactly how you would expect us to implement that given that so much of what is available or given that we do not currently regulate content on the internet and also given that so much of the content on the internet is arriving from many, many, many international destinations.", "8748 What is the approach you want us to take on that?", "8749 MR. MALKOWSKI: If you look at the FCC, they have two important legal basis. The Americans with Disabilities Act is one piece of legislation and the 21st Century Captioning Act, those are both important pieces of legislation and require functional equivalent access to information and communication. That's the captioning.", "8750 In Canada, we have several important federal pieces of legislation. The Human Rights Act is first and soon the Government of Canada will announce a new Canadians with Disabilities Act. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, there's a legal obligation and we need the CRTC to establish regulations that require internet service providers to include captions for movies, for TV, emergency announcements, the live news broadcasts, for live broadcasts, to give functional equivalence access.", "8751 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So I understand you\u2019re talking about domestic production only?", "8752 MR. MALKOWSKI: Yes. ", "8753 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "8754 One last note, I think. In terms of emergency situations, the ones you described in Ottawa, since that time the emergency alerting via the broadcast system has come into play so that visual messages appear on television screens in the event of an emergency. What is your experience with that?", "8755 MR. MALKOWSKI: Yes, I\u2019ve had experience with that. When there\u2019s a special emergency announcement or the Prime Minister of Canada is speaking there\u2019s no captioning. Other channels there\u2019s no captions. Twelve (12) hours later the captions are added. ", "8756 Compare that to the United States, an emergency national weather announcement, a hurricane, tornados hitting an area, the tendency is that the State governor will make an announcement or the President of the United States. And you\u2019ll see them on screen with a sign language interpreter. ", "8757 In Canada we haven\u2019t seen that. We don\u2019t have the interpreter standing beside the person making an announcement. That\u2019s an accessibility. We would need both sign language and captioning.", "8758 And I think the CRTC should consider that and perhaps should review how we can improve the captioning for emergency service and also for press conferences. And so that you possibly should just keep it in mind that we should have that captioning for live news. CTV and CBC now do have captions but there still needs to be improvement in the quality. We need to work on that.", "8759 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I understand that issue very well in terms of the accuracy.", "8760 Thank you. Those are my questions. My colleagues may have some follow-up. Thanks again for your presentation.", "8761 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Well, I\u2019ve just polled my colleagues to see if they had some questions; apparently not. So thank you very much for having participated in the hearing and answering our questions. Very much appreciated. ", "8762 MR. MALKOWSKI: Thank you.", "8763 THE CHAIRPERSON: So we\u2019ll take a short break. ", "8764 It is necessary, Madam Secretary? No. We\u2019re ready to go? ", "8765 Okay. If we\u2019re ready to go let\u2019s go.", "8766 THE SECRETARY: We will now hear the presentation of CNIB and Alliance for Quality of Blind Canadians, appearing by teleconference, Mr. Greco and Mr. Bissonnette. Can you hear us well?", "8767 MR. BISSONNETTE: Yes, we can. I can. You\u2019re a little faint. If there\u2019s some way you could turn it up a little bit that would be very helpful.", "8768 THE SECRETARY: Okay. Well, you can begin with your presentation. You have 10 minutes. You may begin.", "PRESENTATION ", "8769 MR. BISSONNETTE: Thank you very much for the opportunity. This is Dr. Leo Bissonnette speaking from Montreal.", "8770 In this discussion, where indeed there was this broad discussion about broadening services, broadband services, it\u2019s a very timely discussion. And I think we could take it to another level where we would -- it gets us back to a policy discussion around universal services.", "8771 And in that broader discussion, in our larger submission and in the documents submitted today we bring in what we think to be an important document around universal design. We think that certainly on first reading of such document it certainly sounds like it\u2019s very much what you would take down to the product design level. It has policy implications. ", "8772 And indeed, as a researcher very much interested in universal design as a paradigm for use and education in other fields, it became very clear that in the United States the Americans with Disabilities Act was used by the FCC to do the kind of things that we\u2019re promoting here today on a policy level. ", "8773 And in order to be clear I want to be sure that we understand what universal design is, and if I can draw your attention to the supplemental document that we submitted. We have a definition of universal design that is very much hallmarked in this discussion. It comes out of work done out of the University of North Carolina. And basically it talks about, well, products and environments to be designed to be usable by all people to the greatest possible extent -- and this is very important -- without the need for further adaptations or specialized design.", "8774 And out of that come very specific principles that are briefly enunciated in our document that really get down to dealing with the design to accommodate a range of individual preferences and abilities. And on another level that can be taken to a policy discussion as well.", "8775 So what we are proposing here is very much taking an approach from a policy perspective that brings universal design into the discussion as guiding policy principles. And certainly they will filter down to the product design level, where indeed anything that is designed -- be it a website, be it a product, be it a device -- will take into account in very practical terms what is needed. ", "8776 It is our view that in order for this to happen the principles do get us back to policy guidelines that can inform the discussion by all the players in the field of telecommunications in the next few years.", "8777 So by way of an overview, I would urge the Commission to consider what we have here, our documents, as policy recommendations that bring into the discussion of the needs of all Canadians the specific needs of those with disabilities. And the guidelines here get very specific as to what the kinds of things should be considered as such discussions, and policy formulations take place. ", "8778 Leo?", "8779 MR. GRECO: Okay. Thank you, Leo. ", "8780 With consideration to the time that we\u2019ve been allotted this morning we\u2019d like to cite one example that\u2019s pretty much universally understood. And that is, the prevalence of curbcuts. Unfortunately they\u2019re not everywhere. We\u2019re starting to see them widely proliferated, and which has an obvious benefit to people using mobility devices. ", "8781 However, using, you know, staying within the concept of universal design, the benefits of that simple modification go far beyond the -- let\u2019s call it the \u201cintended audience\u201d which was people using mobility devices, folks using skateboards, annoying as they may be, and other, you know, two-wheeled bicycles or what have you benefit from that, mothers with strollers, people that acquire temporary disabilities as a result of an accident or what have you. ", "8782 That simple modification at intersections makes it possible and easy for anyone regardless of their physical state to be able to, you know, to cross the intersection. ", "8783 It\u2019s much less expensive to design that at the onset of the planning phase rather than revisit it six months or a year down the road and to have to redesign that intersection to put in the appropriate curbcuts. ", "8784 Yes, this is a simplistic example in the sense that it\u2019s direct bearing to what the future of telecommunication services in this country looks like is perhaps not readily apparent. But the overarching concept is that if policy and direction to industry and the suppliers that industry interacts with, if that becomes the expectation from the Commission on down, then questions around well, this particular service isn\u2019t accessible, it\u2019s not usable by someone who is blind or visually impaired, those questions and those challenges will start to diminish.", "8785 Leo, I\u2019ll put it back to you.", "8786 MR. BISSONNETTE: Thank you, Lui.", "8787 And again, based on experience that I have had as a researcher and practitioner of universal design in the fields of education and disability, there are those benefits that Mr. Greco refers to. And at a policy level, the long-term benefits will be that as we look towards universal services, any discussion that uses this as a paradigm shift will benefit.", "8788 Thank you.", "8789 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Thank you. This is Jean-Pierre Blais, the Chairman speaking. I\u2019m going to put you in the hands of Commissioner MacDonald to ask you some questions.", "8790 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Good morning. It\u2019s Chris MacDonald. I\u2019ll start off by thanking you for your example of the curb cuts because I think in a way it actually gets to why we\u2019re all sitting here today with the point that it\u2019s better and perhaps even ultimately more inexpensive to build the system right, to build it once as opposed to continuing to go back after the fact for Band-Aid solutions. So thank you for that example.", "8791 Yesterday we heard from a group Media Access Canada. And I was struck by the statements of one of their members. And she said that these conversations aren\u2019t about augmenting the communications for people with disabilities. What we\u2019re really talking about are the communication services available to people with disabilities. It\u2019s how they communicate.", "8792 And with that in mind, I\u2019m wondering if you could perhaps speak to the specific technology, the specific services that you require to effectively communicate in the modern world and how those various different technologies or applications have an impact on the service that you require from your service providers.", "8793 MR. BISSONNETTE: If I may start the discussion, let me put it this way, in a practical way as a smart phone user these days where I do a lot of my work on a phone, if I didn\u2019t have accessibility -- and I\u2019m an iPhone user, but it\u2019s a good illustration. At the time it built in accessibility that\u2019s there out of the box, if you will, I wouldn\u2019t be able to conduct my daily activities. And I think what others are looking for are ultimately products that enable them to do the kinds of things I just described, without having to add on an extra cost from third party adaptation.", "8794 So in a very practical way, that\u2019s the kinds of things that I\u2019m talking about. The television remote is another example. Make it acceptable, make it -- design it from the ground up and it can be used. Lui?", "8795 MR. GRECO: Specifically related to service providers, be they telecom, television or internet service providers, I think the backend where customer interaction takes place needs to be really thought through. ", "8796 I\u2019m not talking about simply managing bills or services or adding or removing account features. A specific example would be the modems that are provided by carriers. Yes, they\u2019re purchased from -- I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s appropriate to name manufacturers, but I will anyway. They may be purchased from a Motorola or a C-Gate or some other, you know, hardware device manufacturer. But they\u2019re branded. They\u2019re branded and they\u2019re customized to meet their particular network protocols or configurations that that carrier has in place.", "8797 As a person who\u2019s blind, I find it extremely frustrating that the branding is prevalent in the backend of the devices. But yet, simple things like adding ball tags to images, which tells me what a button or a link will do, is absent.", "8798 The aps that the majority or that the carriers in this country are now promoting, AT&T has adopted a framework within their company that everything goes through a disability list. Perhaps none of the carriers in this country have the same magnitude that, you know, an organization like AT&T has. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not possible to apply the same type of disability lens when they\u2019re introducing the aps into the marketplace.", "8799 The know-how, the standards are free. The know-how is abundant. And, as we\u2019ve articulated in numerous other presentations that we\u2019ve made to the Commission, both through Mr. Bissonnette and myself, as well as other folks from CNIB and our respective organizations, the community of people who are blind and or visually impaired are more than willing to provide some type of user testing. Because even if a product is designed to be accessible, the subtleties of using something with a mouse or and a keyboard, and using it with a screen reader or a large print program or a display device, you can\u2019t replicate that in a lab, regardless of what testing protocols you have in place, unless you\u2019re fluent with the assistive technology being, you know, being utilized.", "8800 So those are some of the frustrations that -- or not -- I don\u2019t know, maybe \u201cfrustrations\u201d isn\u2019t the right word. Those are some of the challenges that I think need to be addressed. And I think that as you deliberate on, you know, sort of the future of telecommunications services, this type of notion needs to be more prevalent.", "8801 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Setting aside the topic of applications and specific equipment for a minute, do you, from your own personal knowledge, have you ever seen any of the service providers actually applying that disability lens to their suite of products when they\u2019re designing a particular package? Do you get the sense that they do keep persons with disabilities front of mind in designing those packages?", "8802 MR. GRECO: Leo, I\u2019m going to step in here, if I can. I would say that on scale the answer is no. ", "8803 And I can give you a specific example where a broadcaster recently made changes to their IBR programming, sort of, they\u2019re not -- sorry, their electronic program guide. Where it went from being usable by a client of CNIB\u2019s who has some residual vision to being completely unusable because of a simple choice of font and contrast that the developers used in the redesign of the program guide.", "8804 If a disability lens had been applied when that new program guide was being redesigned, then the functionality wouldn\u2019t have been hampered or slowed down, but simply the selection of font and colour and contrast and all the things that make it, let\u2019s use the word \u201cseeable\u201d -- I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a word -- by someone with reduced vision wouldn\u2019t have happened.", "8805 When you look at the number of aps that are available through some of the carriers, I think that to really be able to answer that question accurately, some type of an audit would need to be done with specifically with a disability lens in mind. ", "8806 Is the app findable? Can you find it through the company\u2019s electronic store? Is it downloadable to whatever device is advertised and does it work with various assistive technologies.", "8807 I don\u2019t want to pretend to know the answer to what that audit would find, but I think my experience as someone who has been blind for more than a generation, I think that history would predicate that the results would be less than what we as the blind community would hope for.", "8808 And quite honestly, based on some of the policies, policy directions that the Commission has put forward, I think you would be rather disappointed to find that, you know, the number of apps that actually were usable out of the box by someone with a visual disability.", "8809 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I think ---", "8810 MR. GRECO: If I might add, it\u2019s very much the case that indeed in any discussions that we\u2019ve had in the telecoms, even in the last year, they\u2019re quite surprised to find out that first well there\u2019s an interest on our part about the accessibility of an app and I think they\u2019re surprised to find out that it\u2019s -- when they really get down to testing that they\u2019re not accessible and that starts the conversation.", "8811 But really you want that conversation to -- not to have to happen. You want that design process to incorporate disability design into the whole process from the word go.", "8812 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Are there any -- well I guess I\u2019ll start off, yesterday in one of the presentations, a woman mentioned an app that she uses. She\u2019s visually impaired, called bemyeyes.", "8813 And I had a chance to look at it online and it\u2019s -- I can see how it would be extremely useful for people with impaired vision, so they can reach out to people to, you know, read a menu in a restaurant or help them navigate an unfamiliar building, for example.", "8814 And I\u2019m just wondering are there any best practices either within the country or internationally that you\u2019re aware of that service providers do use to ensure that they are adequately in tune with the needs of people with disabilities and how they may need to adapt their -- be they their packages, or their bandwidth options, or their internal processes, to maintain a state of excellence in servicing those customers?", "8815 MR. BISSONNETTE: There are standards that are available and certainly those standards need to be brought to the table. There are clear guidelines for web design that certainly would be helpful. ", "8816 There are certain standards for apps that we, you know, as follow-up to these discussions could point you to. ", "8817 The bemyeyes app is an interesting one that certainly illustrates that there are benefits to having specialized apps.", "8818 But really what we want, from my perspective, would be to have, for example, if I\u2019m using a particular telecoms app I would like to be able, the minute I buy that, to know that all the buttons are accessible, usable, so that I can perform the same tasks as the app is designed to do.", "8819 And certainly any further revisions to the app, because often times you\u2019ll find that when an app is approved, in quotes, all of a sudden the accessibility that was there before is gone. You want that quality of accessibility to still be factored into the further updates to the app. ", "8820 It\u2019s going to be a long way to go but there are some standards and certainly that\u2019s a discussion that certainly we\u2019d be glad to have with the telecoms themselves or the Commission in future discussion.", "8821 MR. GRECO: Just to add to what Leo -- what Leo has said, I think the direct answer to your question, Mr. MacDonald, is no. ", "8822 My particular carrier, my service provider who I bundle all my services through, their customer contact, the online customer contact portal, uses a series of, I believe, they\u2019re drop-downs or some type of JavaScript enabled menus that don\u2019t work at all with assistive technology.", "8823 Now, yes I do have the option of picking up the phone and asking a question or expressing a concern, but that\u2019s ridiculous. That -- if that were properly tested with the -- through an accessibility lens, I don\u2019t believe that it would need a complete re-design.", "8824 I don\u2019t think it would need to be overhauled and scrapped and started from, you know, from square zero. ", "8825 I think all that would need to happen would be just some simple modification to the way that -- to the functionality of the -- you know, select the reason why you\u2019re contacting us. Select the department and then narrow down the searches. ", "8826 I think that that could be very easily retrofitted so that it worked. And again, going back to sort of the overarching theme of what -- what Mr. Bissonnette and I are talking about in universal design, if that thought stream was prevalent at the design stage, at the business analysis stage, when that particular functionality was being contemplated, the need for accessibility, you know, the justification for being there would be inherent throughout the entire software development life cycle of, you know, of that functionality.", "8827 And the frustration that I personally -- and I can vouch that many other people from across the country regardless of their provider encounter wouldn\u2019t happen. ", "8828 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You know it strikes me that many of the applications and services that we\u2019re discussing may be very negatively impacted depending on the quality of service that you actual receive from your telecommunication service provider.", "8829 And I\u2019m just wondering if you can speak to what the level of service is that you receive and when there is an outage, when there is, you know, packet loss or latency, what impact it has on your ability to function?", "8830 MR. GRECO: Leo?", "8831 MR. BISSONNETTE: Well certainly my experience maybe is more limited in some respects, but if I can draw the example from television services, if my cable provider suddenly changes even something simple like channels, I don\u2019t have access to a talking guide that helps me find something.", "8832 Well that puts me at a disadvantage from taking advantage of information and information these days is a very key part of it.", "8833 If you take it back to the cell phone example or the smart phone example, if I\u2019m not able to negotiate if I\u2019m applying, for example, for a job online and that\u2019s what more and more people are doing these days, if I can\u2019t get around that website through my device I can\u2019t make that application even to be considered for the job, therefore -- and employability for our population is not good, statistically. ", "8834 If you can\u2019t even make that job application then you\u2019re further put behind the eight ball if you will.", "8835 So what we need are -- is a -- it\u2019s universal access to services that make that job application doable as an example. ", "8836 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And your example of the job application is a great segue with where I wanted to go next, because you note in your original intervention the very high levels of unemployment that Canadians with disabilities face and as a result they sometimes tend to be in the -- in the lowest income group in the country.", "8837 And I\u2019m wondering do the service providers do anything today, that you\u2019re aware of, to make their offerings more affordable to people with disabilities?", "8838 We heard an example yesterday about a woman who was hard of hearing and only wanted to purchase an internet package as opposed to a landline telephone service, but she had to buy both services just to avail of the bundle and get the low internet rate. ", "8839 So can you speak to what providers may be doing to ease the financial burden on people with disabilities, if anything at all?", "8840 MR. BISSONNETTE: Well the closest I can come and it\u2019s not even in the field of disability, it\u2019s my understanding that Rogers are doing something in Toronto for those who are in a poverty situation.", "8841 In terms of disability I\u2019m personally not aware of anything that would help in that regard. ", "8842 Now is this the time, as we\u2019re looking at how to re-bundle services, leaner packages, smaller packages, to factor in to that discussion the needs of persons with disabilities in some kind of a package that is number one, more affordable, and number two, incorporating the disability related needs that have to be dealt with.", "8843 MR. GRECO: I think to try and answer Mr. MacDonald\u2019s question, I think specifically related to disability, to the best of my knowledge, which may not necessarily be all encompassing, the answer is no. ", "8844 There are some low end entry level pricing packages where service, either channel lineup, or phone service, or minimal speeds are available, but those are simply on the shelf alongside every other -- you know, every other offering.", "8845 Is that adequate to address some of the challenges facing Canadians with vision loss who are living in poverty? I would put that back and say that the answer depends on whether that addresses the question of poverty amongst Canadians as a whole.", "8846 Poverty is poverty. The threshold I think is the basket of goods and services -- I can\u2019t remember the acronyms, but I think it\u2019s $21,000 a year, if you live below that poverty threshold then you\u2019re deemed to be, you know, living below the poverty line. I would say that shelling out $100 a month for telephone, internet and basic, or skinny television as it\u2019s supposed to be called now, is a hardship. ", "8847 Are all of those services necessary to be engaged members of society? Yes, they are. You can\u2019t live without some type of communication services, and if you want to know what\u2019s going on in the community, whether you use the internet or you rely on television, you need a portal. It\u2019s not affordable at $100 a month for someone who -- you know, who\u2019s living below that poverty line.", "8848 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I have a similar question with respect to government as well. We\u2019ve heard from a number of low income Canadians and have spoken to the fact that communication services are not included in as an element in the calculations for their social assistance programs. And I\u2019m curious whether the various different governments do anything to help offset the unique expenses that people in the blind and visually impaired community might have with respect to specialized services, specialized equipment that enables you to connect with the world. Are any of those costs offset in any way?", "8849 MR. GRECO: It\u2019s a real -- it\u2019s Lui speaking. It\u2019s a real mishmash across the country. Ontario and Alberta have quite an extensive program that will provide at either no cost or 25 percent of the cost for assistive technology.", "8850 The Alberta program is run through the Department of Health and it has a $650,000 annual cap. So once that threshold is exceeded then folks are expected to wait until the next funding cycle.", "8851 Ontario\u2019s program is a little bit more robust, in the sense that I don\u2019t believe -- I stand to be corrected on this, but I don\u2019t believe there is a -- there is quite -- you know, quite the same extent of a cap. ", "8852 Leo can speak to the reality in Quebec. ", "8853 But in every other province access to assistive technologies through public funding typically requires being in receipt of social assistance benefits, and that threshold -- $21,000 is gravy. The threshold to receive social assistance benefits in most provinces is almost zero assets, zero income. So you\u2019re right on the periphery before you can expect to gain any assistance.", "8854 Where that becomes a challenge is for those folks that are working poor, perhaps lucky enough to have a minimum wage job, they neither qualify for social assistance, which would entitle them to assistance with the appropriate assistive technology, nor the means to purchase it themselves because it\u2019s prohibitive and when you\u2019re looking at rent, food, or a text to speech program so that you can use your computer the choices become quite clear.", "8855 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: In your intervention you also spoke, you know, about the divide that can be created, you know, if you\u2019re not able to leverage technology and leverage networks to connect with people. ", "8856 I\u2019m wondering is there a similar divide created between people in your community living in urban areas versus living in rural areas who may not have access to technology or to the networks to connect to the world.", "8857 I would assume that if it\u2019s a problem in the urban areas it must at least be as significant a problem in the rural areas.", "8858 MR. BISSONNETTE: I think the simple answer, the shorter answer is it\u2019s the same problem, it\u2019s the matter now of what type of infrastructure narrows that gap but the problem is there.", "8859 MR. GRECO: I think it\u2019s exactly for folks living in rural communities because the availability of other services like transportation becomes more problematic. ", "8860 So I guess there\u2019s -- you know, the short answer is that if you\u2019re living in, you know, Sundre, Alberta, which is probably a 30-minute drive outside of Calgary and about 25 minutes from Red Deer, which are the two sort of centres where you could access doctor\u2019s appointments and perhaps, you know, major shopping, if you\u2019re blind and you happen to live in that community you are entirely dependent on either someone driving you to those appointments, or, with respect to this conversation, in order to stay connected with folks you are reliant on the accessibility and the availability of reliable -- you know, reliable services through your internet provider, or your broadcast distribution undertaking, whatever -- you know, whichever means you use to stay engaged.", "8861 So folks living in rural parts of the country I think are more reliant on these emerging technologies. They offer more opportunities for engagement than they normally would have. ", "8862 Those of us who live in, you know, larger municipalities isolation is still very real but most of us have access either to some type of paratransit service that can get us to and from independently, or if you walk out the door and access public transit to, you know, socialize, or to go to work, or do what we need to do. ", "8863 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Perfect.", "8864 Just one final question before I hand you back over to my colleagues. We\u2019ve heard a lot of different suggestions since the hearing started about what people would like to see the CRTC specifically do, and some of those suggestions range from doing absolutely nothing to doing -- and leaving the situation as it currently is, to creating a fund to provide support for low income Canadians, creating a fund of some kind to build out networks, and you suggest that perhaps we work as an intermediary between service providers, stakeholders, and government.", "8865 I\u2019d like to ask what you would view as success coming out of this hearing.", "8866 MR. GRECO: Well, how about the fact that we didn\u2019t have to come back and talk to you again.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "8867 MR. GRECO: How about success in my books would be defined as the conversation with the service providers and carriers was ongoing, was fruitful, we the community of folks with vision loss or other disabilities were actively engaged barriers to accessibility or accessibility barriers were addressed effectively by service providers, and that the Commission's role was simply to, you know, to regulate their -- the business environment that the service providers (inaudible). ", "8868 Is that realistic? No. We probably will be back. In fact, I know that we'll be back. We\u2019ll be back in, you know, future hearings, but I think that, you know, CNIB's perspective would be that we put ourself out of business, that these conversations don\u2019t need to happen at the regulatory level any more because providers and other players within the, you know, within the arena are addressing accessibility challenges in a serious manner rather than superficially, I believe, is our experience today. ", "8869 MR. BISSONNETTE: May I add that as we evolve, these discussions as we evolve policy, it certainly is my hope that our presentation around universal design this morning gives you a paradigm shift for policy and even product design that moves us further down the road to a point where the access barriers are down, that we have products and services that are available to us at the good reasonable costs, good access built in, and have something that's affordable for all Canadians. Thank you. ", "8870 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Well, thank you very much for that, and like I said, I appreciate that was a very broad question. I will turn you back over to my colleagues.", "8871 THE CHAIRPERSON: So Commissioner Vennard had some questions for you as well.", "8872 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Hello. I'd like to turn the discussion back to your original concept of a universal design, and maybe one way to move things forward -- and perhaps you have already gone down this path and if so, then maybe you could enlighten us as to the efforts that you\u2019ve made so far. When it comes to designing systems, products, including even social systems but certainly with devices and peripherals and so on, it comes from educated people that learn design principles. ", "8873 To what extent do you think that the universal design should be incorporated much, much earlier on within educational programs, engineering students, for example, learning to design systems, computer systems and assisted devices and so on, within our educational system? ", "8874 And along with that comes the awareness that there is a great deal of diversity in our country. How is -- have you done anything along those lines? I\u2019m sure you have. Could you maybe enlighten us as to what you\u2019ve done? ", "8875 MR. BISSONNETTE: May I take that question on? I have somewhat of an educational background, if I may say, where I did the (inaudible) research and I also was the manager of an office for students with disabilities at Concordia University in Montreal for over 30 years. ", "8876 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: That's why I put the question to you. ", "8877 MR. BISSONNETTE: (Inaudible) a lot of our time with our faculties, number one, doing sensitization to disability and the needs of a disabled population, and we try to drill that down to what it meant to live with a disability day to day.", "8878 On another level, because you want to develop the educated professionals do a designing, it's pointing you to the work that we briefly said in this morning through North Carolina where you get that needed (inaudible) design to happen. And indeed, University of Wisconsin, the Trace Centre is another wonderful place for the Commission to look to and even the telecoms to look to for the actual discussions around what does it mean to make a computer screen accessible so that someone sitting in front of it is able to deal with it in a way that is productive, the fatigue is reduced, and so forth. ", "8879 There's a lot of good universal design concepts and programs in place that are turning out the architects, designers, to do the very kind of things we're talking about. ", "8880 MR. GRECO: I think to add to that, the problems of students with disabilities within the education system from, you know, K to 12 and beyond --those individuals, I think, will leave a resounding consciousness with their colleagues as their colleagues move on to, you know, higher education.", "8881 So the awareness of disability, I think, is greater than it's ever been. Unfortunately, the prevalence is much higher and the demographics speak for themselves with aging, et cetera. ", "8882 But I don\u2019t know to what extent universal design or accessibility concepts are taught within -- let's use computer science as an example. I don't know whether that's, you know, there's an Accessibility 201 course that talks about that. ", "8883 I know when I went back to school about 15, 16 years ago, accessibility was a one-sided conversation and I was the only one talking. ", "8884 So have things changed? I don't think they have significantly, but I think as the consciousness among society, of the barriers facing people with disabilities -- as that consciousness increases, hopefully more and more designers and programmers will start to gravitate towards, \"I need to make this do A, B, and C, and D, if it has to be usable by people of varying abilities.\"", "8885 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Any other comments in that respect?", "8886 MR. BISSONNETTE: I think certainly, if I may, when we look at building design, as Lui talked about in his example, that is the one area that has really made the big progress, in terms of getting it into the faculties for purposes of education. ", "8887 And indeed, if you will, there have come out in recent years a generation of architects that are much more savvy in terms of design standards. ", "8888 And it started in faculties of computer science. I can point to Concordia University as one example where there has been an evolutionary movement; not a revolutionary one, but an evolutionary one, a step by step progress.", "8889 So long term, I guess I'm the optimist in the room that says, \"It can happen.\" It's clear that it has to happen through preparing a generation of skilled experts who are designing products and services where they bring to the table that expertise and knowledge of disability. ", "8890 MR. GRECO: If you -- it's Lui speaking. If you take a look at what's happening in Ontario with AODA over the last 10 years, the number of stakeholders at the table talking about accessibility, it's greater in your province than it is anywhere else in the country. ", "8891 AODA, love it or hate it, is -- has raised the bar on the need for accessibility and why it's important. ", "8892 And with Manitoba adopting disability legislation, the conversations are probably becoming more prevalent in that province. Nova Scotia and British Columbia are now at various stages of introducing provincial disability legislation, and I think the ripple effect will be that acceptability and disability, the need to accommodate people with disabilities, will become prevalent throughout society and educational institutions will begin to adopt that stream of learning into, you know, into their various programs, outside of the psychology and social work arenas. ", "8893 MR. BISSONNETTE: If I could quickly add, the Quebec example, in 1978, they passed Bill 9, which was an Act to secure the handicapped rights in the areas of housing, education, so forth, and that gave them a bit of a, shall I say a jump, and I think there has been a trickle-down benefit that certainly educational institutions became aware early in the game of what was being asked for. ", "8894 And if I can crystal-ball gaze a little, if indeed we do get a Canadian Disabilities Act, and we do make some comparisons to what has happened in the U.S. with their BDA over the past 25 years there. I suspect that that conversation and evolution might pick up a little speed. ", "8895 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes, well, we can certainly hope for that, can\u2019t we? I think that in general there might be just sort of a lack of awareness of the difficulties and challenges that people face, more so than any sort of real exclusion in that sense. ", "8896 My own granddaughter is a wheelchair user and lots of times she simply can\u2019t get in places because she just can\u2019t get in places, and there\u2019s different problems at school with elevators and so on and so forth. So very often we just need to make people aware of these things, and sometimes we need to do that in a very formal sense that too through school programs and courses and so on. ", "8897 Any final comments that you would like to offer to us on your universal design?", "8898 MR. BISSONNETTE: I guess my final comment would be that I hope there is that policy benefit to take to this discussion, and that it can trickle down and that it can bring about general awareness in the public, and certainly among the professionals who are providing services of other sorts, that design is incorporated in what they do.", "8899 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, I agree.", "8900 MR. BISSONNETTE: Thank you.", "8901 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Thank you.", "8902 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. I\u2019m checking and apparently there are no other questions from Commissioners or legal counsel. ", "8903 So thank you very much for having participated in the proceeding. ", "8904 MR. GRECO: Thank you for the opportunity. We really appreciate the chance to share our thoughts, and look forward to your deliberations.", "8905 THE CHAIRPERSON: There are further rounds of comments available, so do avail yourself of that if you wish, a little later on as pointed out in the public notice.", "8906 So thank you again.", "8907 MR. BISSONNETTE: Thank you.", "8908 THE CHAIRPERSON: We\u2019ll take a short break until 10:45 and see where we\u2019re at.

You have five minutes for your presentation. ", "PRESENTATION ", "8915 Mr. Coyle: Hi. Thanks very much, and good morning. ", "8916 I\u2019m a person who\u2019s just going to talk off the cuff here, okay? I\u2019m coming from a learning disabled background. And I noticed that there was nobody talking to that group of disabled people so I thought I\u2019d just come in and talk to you guys.", "8917 My submission basically is how the Bell Corporation and other corporations, telecommunications possibly -- I\u2019ve been watching the hearings -- aren\u2019t following the laws, okay? There\u2019s laws that are basically -- and here in Ontario -- well, sorry, I know we\u2019re in Gatineau. ", "8918 But in Ontario there\u2019s the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities, okay. This act indicates that there are barriers to be removed, policies and procedures to be removed for the disabled community, okay.

If they don\u2019t follow the law that licence gets removed, or penalties can be ensued, okay.", "8921 I\u2019m talking a very hard game here because they do not accommodate the disabled community. You\u2019ve heard from the hearings about other disabled groups how they\u2019re not rolling things out quickly or fast or not enough, right? What we need as a disabled community as a whole is teeth to this argument, okay. You need to take a bite out of the ISPs and you need to take a very hard stand on this, okay.

I don\u2019t want to deal with that. The anxiety from dealing with them alone is very hard to deal with. Poverty and not being able to feed yourself and then pay your bills, okay, on time it\u2019s a bit of a juggle to say the least, okay. It\u2019s almost impossible without help, okay.", "8931 We\u2019re in the information age. We get no support from Ontario to deal with the information age whatsoever.

And I don\u2019t really have any further questions for you except you did make one comment in your submission that I\u2019d like you to just maybe expand on. I think it\u2019s a very important comment that you made. And that comment was that people with disabilities sometimes don\u2019t even know how to find, for example, us. Do you have any recommendations on how to make information, generally speaking, more available so that people in the disabled community can participate more in the public processes that we have?", "8966 MR.

These are remarkable achievements considering Canada's sparse population and challenging geography.", "8999 At Bell, we believe that the outcome that the Commission should pursue is in ensuring that the 4 percent of Canadian households that do not have access to 5 and 1 broadband service today are served and therefore able to participate in the digital economy.", "9000 Jonathan?", "9001 MR. DANIELS: Upon completion of the government's Connecting Canadians program and Northwestel's Modernization Plan, there will remain 441,000 households that do not have access to the current target speeds of 5 and 1.", "9002 Of these remaining households, approximately 50,000 are located in the country's most remote areas, areas which for contribution purposes are referred to as Bands G and H1", "9003 In order to estimate the cost of closing the digital divide, we looked at the broadband build costs associated with the Connecting Canadians program and developed certain key assumptions.", "9004 Based on this analysis, Bell estimates that it would cost approximately 1.2 to $1.7 billion to extend 5/1 broadband connectivity to the 441,000 households that do not have access.", "9005 Of this amount, 230 to 280 million is needed to provide connectivity to those households in Bands G and H1. We have detailed assumptions to support these cost estimates, which we would be pleased to discuss with you.", "9006 If we assume that the federal government's $500 million broadband fund, announced in the most recent budget, auctions off subsidy funds to the lowest bidder on the basis of a 1:1 matching ratio, as Connecting Canadians did, this will generate a total of $1 billion in broadband infrastructure funding.", "9007 This would almost entirely cover the cost of building to those households outside of Bands G and H1 that do not have 5/1 service today.", "9008 The build out of connectivity to the remaining 50,000 households located in Bands G and H1 could be accomplished by re-directing existing voice contribution funds through the elimination of the voice subsidy in Bands E and F and reducing voice subsidies in Bands G and H1.", "9009 This redirection of existing subsidy would make $370 million available for broadband over the next five years in Bands G and H1.", "9010 In the spirit of working collaboratively, we believe that the Commission should coordinate with the government by reporting on the state of broadband connectivity and giving advice to the government on how to invest the $500 million.", "9011 To be clear, we favour a report first in order to ensure that any Commission fund and government funding can be coordinated and complementary.", "9012 However, if the Commission does choose to act now, it could do so by re-directing existing voice contribution funds to broadband without increasing contribution beyond current levels.", "9013 St\u00e9phanie?", "9014 Mme ROBERGE: Dans le questionnaire du Conseil sur la large bande, les Canadiens ont indiqu\u00e9 que leurs principales activit\u00e9s en ligne consistent \u00e0 communiquer par courriel, \u00e0 s'informer sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ayant cours, \u00e0 rechercher de l'information m\u00e9dicale, \u00e0 effectuer leurs op\u00e9rations bancaires, et \u00e0 utiliser les sites web gouvernementaux.", "9015 Les Canadiens veulent aussi pouvoir communiquer avec leur famille et leurs amis au moyen de Skype et de FaceTime, regarder des vid\u00e9os sur CraveTV, Netflix ou YouTube, et jouer \u00e0 des jeux en ligne.", "9016 La preuve sur le plan technique permet de constater que la vitesse 5/1 cibl\u00e9e par le gouvernement en vertu du programme Un Canada branch\u00e9 permet de r\u00e9aliser tous ces types d'activit\u00e9s.", "9017 Dans son Rapport de surveillance des communications 2015, le Conseil lui-m\u00eame a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'une connexion de 5 m\u00e9gabits par seconde permet d'ex\u00e9cuter la vaste majorit\u00e9 des applications, y compris les jeux en temps r\u00e9el, la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence et la vid\u00e9o HD en continu.", "9018 Netflix, par exemple, recommande une vitesse de 5 m\u00e9gabits par seconde pour la vid\u00e9o HD en continu.

FLAHERTY: The Commission has asked whether a specific mechanism is required to support investments in transport facilities in Northwestel's operating territory and in other rural and remote areas. We don't think this is necessary.", "9031 Instead, we recommend that an auction to provide service in satellite communities be handled separately from any terrestrial auction rather than implementing a specific mechanism to support investments in transport facilities.", "9032 For satellite communities, ongoing subsidy is necessary to assist with the lease of transponder capacity and ensure rates become more affordable in these communities.", "9033 We believe it would be appropriate to conduct two distinct processes, providing a one-time subsidy for terrestrial builds, and an ongoing subsidy for satellite communities.", "9034 When it comes to voice, we have proposed two changes.", "9035 First, we submit that the choice of long distance service provider should no longer form part of the BSO.", "9036 Second, we believe that the requirement to provide dial-up service should also be removed.

MALCOLMSON: There has been discussion throughout the hearing that the Commission should create a subsidy program to address the affordability of broadband service or a mandate --", "9046 THE SECRETARY: Can you -- sorry.", "9047 MR.

Bell opposes both of these suggestions.", "9051 The evidence on the record shows broadband service is generally affordable in Canada except, unfortunately, among a segment of low income Canadians and in remote communities where the higher cost of providing service necessarily results in higher retail pricing. ", "9052 We\u2019ve addressed the concerns of rural and remote areas with our subsidy proposal in our remarks earlier.", "9053 Regarding affordability, as the Affordable Access Coalition indicated in their testimony last week, the issue is not about internet rates being just and reasonable, but rather it\u2019s that some Canadians with low incomes struggle to afford the internet. ", "9054 What we\u2019ve heard on the record is that despite this low income Canadians are continuing to subscribe to internet services. ", "9055 This isn\u2019t an issue of access; it\u2019s a matter of what low income Canadians are giving up in order to stay connected. ", "9056 This is fundamentally a poverty issue and for this reason, it is best addressed by government. We are hopeful that a collaborative approach will enable the Commission to work with all levels of government so that the communication needs of low-income Canadians are addressed by social assistance programs. ", "9057 We note that the Government of Yukon\u2019s social assistance program includes a $37 per month low income voice subsidy. Now may be the time to introduce similar government subsidies for broadband.", "9058 The hearing has also brought forward the proposal of a mandated basic broadband service at regulated rates, with which there are a number of significant problems. ", "9059 First, the Commission has already forborne from regulating retail Internet pricing. ", "9060 In order to introduce rate regulated Internet, the Commission would have to make findings of fact in each relevant market that market forces are no longer sufficient in order to protect the interests of users.", "9061 Second, unlike skinny basic T.V. service, the costs of providing broadband are highly variable depending on the area served and the technology deployed, so uniform retail pricing across the country is not possible.", "9062 Third, mandating artificially low prices to serve a small segment of the population inevitably means that the rest of the customer base will pay more.", "9063 Fourth, a mandated basic broadband service could have the unintended consequence of reducing competition in a given market to the detriment of consumers. ", "9064 In some markets, for example, Bell cannot offer a 5 in 1 service today and we have customers in those areas who purchase 1.5 megs service. ", "9065 If a 5/1 basic service was mandated, we might have to withdraw our internet service from those markets, removing an option for consumers.", "9066 Fifth, imposing retail rates on ILECs and cable companies who already have wholesale broadband obligations will create endless regulatory debates about margin squeezing and wholesale discounts.", "9067 Sixth, a mandated basic broadband service would introduce another layer of regulation that would act as a disincentive to investment in next generation network infrastructure.", "9068 And last but not least, those who need assistance the most, low income Canadians participating in this proceeding; have indicated that a one-size-fits-all solution would not meet their needs.", "9069 For all of these reasons, we would urge the Commission not to adopt any form of retail rate regulation for broadband.", "9070 In conclusion, we heard you yesterday and tried to be responsive. We\u2019ve attached, as an appendix to this statement, our ideas regarding how various government stakeholders can collaborate in their efforts to achieve the outcome of providing broadband access to all Canadians.", "9071 And by no means is industry off the hook. Industry should be incented to focus on what it does best - investing in next generation technological improvements to further Canada's broadband deployment initiatives.", "9072 We thank you for the opportunity to appear before you and we\u2019d be please to answer your questions.", "9073 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your presentation. I\u2019ll lead us off, but I will make a reminder that because there is all levels of interpretation we should be conscious of that and slow down the pace and not speak over each other, as sometimes these happen -- these things happen.", "9074 The second thing I\u2019d ask you to do, because you obviously represent a number of companies and I\u2019m going to assume, unless you tell me otherwise, that your answer applies to the entire group of companies, unless you speak up and tell me there\u2019s a specificity associated with, I don\u2019t know, Aliant Assets or Northwestel; is that okay?", "9075 MR. MALCOLMSON: That\u2019s fine, Mr. Chairman.", "9076 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.

So I\u2019ll start off, but at one point we will -- we\u2019ll take a break and come back after lunch; if that\u2019s okay with you?", "9079 So my first question is -- and you know how I usually ask questions. I start off with the very high issues and then I go down to the smaller ones at the end. ", "9080 So in your view who should lead the development of a national broadband strategy?", "9081 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well we think \u2013- we think it\u2019s a combination of the government, the Federal Government and the regulator, and that there are roles to play for both. ", "9082 There are roles to play for both, so it should be led by the Federal Government, it should be led by the CRTC. ", "9083 We\u2019ve made a proposal with respect to what the CRTC could do and it\u2019s our view that there are really three issues that we\u2019re confronting.", "9084 There\u2019s the issue of affordability, there\u2019s the issue of adoption, and there\u2019s the issue of deployment, and our proposal has focused on deployment.", "9085 And what we\u2019re saying is priority one, in our view, should be identifying those Canadians that don\u2019t have access to the basic levels of connectivity today.", "9086 That don\u2019t have access to 5 in 1, in our country\u2019s remotest areas and finding a way to fund the extension of service to those communities.", "9087 And in doing that, recognizing that 5 in 1 may be the standard today, building into that deployment plan an element of future proofing so that people who receive the subsidy would actually build out to 10 in 1 capability.", "9088 So we think the Commission should focus on deployment. We\u2019ve made a deployment proposal. We think that government, obviously, with its $500 million funding announcement, can contribute to deployment. ", "9089 Commission would be playing an important role in advising the government how to do that and in terms of the affordability issue we think that lands squarely at the feet of government.", "9090 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m actually a big fan of shared leadership. I often talk within the Commission, wearing my CEO hat, about the principle of shared leadership, and I\u2019ve written on it, and it works to the extent that you have a government\u2019s model that allows conversations to occur.", "9091 So the other point I make, it\u2019s a bit like the internet itself, which was designed to survive nuclear attacks at the very beginning and so it is designed so that if packets can\u2019t flow one way, they flow another way.", "9092 And this is the challenge, isn\u2019t it, of shared leadership, because if you\u2019ve got part of the network, or the shared leadership that doesn\u2019t step up, others, a bit like the internet, pick up the traffic. ", "9093 So your principle of it being shared quickly comes into conflict with a notion of coordination, or if there is no coordination somebody else has to pick up the slack. And I was wondering if you had any advice with respect to that.", "9094 There are historic institutional divides in machinery of government, and on top of that, to my knowledge, there\u2019s not a great federal, provincial, territorial table to coordinate these things.", "9095 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well thank you for the question, and we do have some views.", "9096 As you\u2019ve said earlier in the proceeding, both the funding of broadband and the deployment of broadband to date has been sort of a patchwork quilt of government initiatives, regulation, and there is a need for coordination.", "9097 I think given the record that you\u2019ve compiled in this proceeding, which we can certainly attest is significant from the perspective of contributing to the record, the record you\u2019ve created provides a very good springboard for the Commission to take on the role of advising the government, perhaps, if there\u2019s willingness, coordinating with the government how those various moving parts can be put together.", "9098 So we very much see as a first step the Commission, if it\u2019s inclined to do so, reporting to the government on the state of broadband, where the gaps are, where the funding is available, what the roles of provincial governments are, what the role of the federal government is. And, as we said, if the Commission wants to act now in terms of contributing to deployment, for example, the Commission could say to the government \u201cthis is the chunk we\u2019re going to bite off, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d So I think you could perform a very valuable role in coordinating the process.", "9099 THE CHAIRPERSON: And if one of the parts of the system, this ecosystem of shared leadership, fails to step up what does one do?", "9100 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, I\u2019m an optimist so I would hope that doesn\u2019t happen.", "9101 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m an optimist as well, but sometimes I also have to be a realist. Because there are people asking, right, there are people who have come to this table saying \u201cwe are left behind\u201d for a number of reasons, not just actually getting connectivity but because they have issues of affordability, they have issues of literacy, they -- the myriad of issues is quite considerable.", "9102 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes, it\u2019s a daunting challenge. If, after a coordinated effort, one agency doesn\u2019t step up then, you know, things within your jurisdiction can always come back to you and you can do more if you feel the need to do more. ", "9103 We also think you could do -- play an important role in monitoring what other agencies are doing and perhaps creating a scorecard or reporting on an annual basis as to how those coordinated efforts are progressing.", "9104 THE CHAIRPERSON: What is your assessment -- because you did mention governments, including I guess provincial and territorial governments. To what extend do you see municipal governments playing a role as well?", "9105 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, maybe I\u2019ll start with federal and provincial. I think our view is their role most importantly -- well, the federal government can play a role in deployment, and we\u2019ve seen that they\u2019ve committed funding to that, but the other important role, and the role we think governments should take on is addressing what\u2019s been described as the affordability problem. I think we would describe it not so much as an affordability problem but a poverty issue that is in need of a social safety net. Clearly broadband connectivity is a necessity and social assistance programs run by governments we think should take that into account now.", "9106 And then in terms of municipal level, again we see some municipalities are actually taking it upon themselves to launch their own broadband projects with government funding, so that\u2019s a role for municipalities.", "9107 THE CHAIRPERSON: But your point always comes back to build out, and the point I\u2019m making is that there\u2019s a larger basket. If you\u2019re going to do a strategy it has to have several components. Yes, build out is one, but surely it\u2019s not the only one, and therefore coordination between several levels of government, let alone municipal, regional arrangements that are above sometimes local government, First Nation bands -- I mean, the number of people potentially involved is daunting, to use your word. ", "9108 So I understand your point when it\u2019s just build out but what of the larger issues of digital literacy and helping people navigate what is obviously a complicated world because it\u2019s not intuitive to some?", "9109 MR. MALCOLMSON: Again, I think our view is that the primary role the Commission should play in terms of exercising its regulatory authority is contributing to the build out. To us, that\u2019s job one.", "9110 THE CHAIRPERSON: I understand that that\u2019s our action, but in setting the direction more broadly.", "9111 MR. MALCOLMSON: And in terms of the other two equally important issues, affordability and adoption, we see your role as potentially coordinating and certainly reporting and monitoring on an ongoing basis.", "9112 We don\u2019t see, Mr. Chairman, the affordability role being primarily assumed by you. We think given what the issue is it\u2019s a poverty issue. We think that\u2019s more appropriately dealt with through government social assistance programs.", "9113 THE CHAIRPERSON: I think people have perhaps forgotten part of what I said yesterday, which was the mere fact that we would express a view on direction doesn\u2019t mean we would become responsible to fund or implement. ", "9114 And the questions I\u2019m asking are assuming that, assuming that we may not be ultimately responsible from a regulatory perspective on some of these issues, there still seems to be a crying need for a level of coordination, and I\u2019m asking you about governance to ensure that that occurs. ", "9115 Because it seems to me that when governments, institutions, the private sector don\u2019t get their act together and say wait, wait, wait, that\u2019s not good in society, it just raises the level of frustration.", "9116 So don\u2019t assume that when I\u2019m asking the questions it\u2019s for us to take it over.", "9117 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, again, Mr. Chairman, I think you, as the expert regulator, could perform a valuable role in, for lack of a better word, coordinating or cajoling other stakeholders into a broader strategy.", "9118 And we are not suggesting that you wait in terms of deployment, we are suggesting that if you see fit you could move forward with admittedly one piece of the puzzle now in terms of a deployment subsidy. ", "9119 My colleague Phil has something to offer.", "9120 MR. GAUVIN: I don\u2019t know if you have the exhibit or attachment there. We\u2019ve lumped in together the municipal and the provincial.", "9121 Yesterday when we were discussing this in late hours, as you can imagine, it was a much longer list. We realize that our recommendations for provincial and municipal were very similar.", "9122 The role that we would see for the Commission in coordinating is issuing a report saying these are the needs of Canadians as we\u2019ve seen from the record. The outcome that we\u2019re seeking is to ensure that all Canadians have access to the services they need to participate in the digital economy. These are the gaps that we\u2019ve observed and the various responsibilities and we\u2019ve listed some here that we think could be addressed, and this is what could happen to make it happen.", "9123 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So -- thank you. And I did see that. So -- although I just got it, and I appreciate you were working on it late, and it\u2019s not a criticism at all but it\u2019s just I haven\u2019t had a chance to pour over it.", "9124 So why don\u2019t you, as a first step, explain to us how you, in a joint leadership coordinated fashion, propose these baskets of responsibility and why.", "9125 MR. MALCOLMSON: And you\u2019re looking, Mr. Chairman, at the ---", "9126 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m looking at -- sorry.", "9127 MR. MALCOLMSON: The one page.", "9128 THE CHAIRPERSON: In your appendix there.", "9129 MR. MALCOLMSON: So really what we tried to do is outline how we could get to the outcomes that I think we\u2019re all collectively striving for. So we\u2019ve identified what we think the role of the Commission could be. And again, we think job one is deployment. I won\u2019t go over that again.", "9130 But similarly, you can play an important role in identifying what the state of broadband is in this country, where the gaps are. We\u2019ve heard about communities where, you know, they\u2019re sort of off the grid and can\u2019t be reached. How do we address those? So we think that you could play an important sort of first-step role in scoping out the problem and saying, \u201cHere\u2019s the problem we collectively face, government regulator industry.\u201d So that\u2019s number one.", "9131 And then I think a very important role for the Commission is to monitor and report on broadband connectivity in Canada. What are government funding programs accomplishing? What is the regulated sector accomplishing? How are the Commission\u2019s policies working? ", "9132 And then, you know, one of our favourite recommendations is number six. You know, we always want to see regulatory policies that create incentives to invest in network infrastructure. ", "9133 Then we move on to the government. What can the federal government do? Well, if you take on the funding responsibility for remote areas of the country you could say the government concentrate on those other areas. Those areas in between the remotest communities but outside of urban centers. And we\u2019ve heard the frustration of sort of people on the edge who aren\u2019t getting service but they\u2019re just that far away. So government funding could play a role in closing that gap.", "9134 From our perspective, you know, you could recommend to government tax policy that, again, incents investment. Up to you as to whether you would want to take that role on. ", "9135 And again, always reviewing government fees, regulatory fees, spectrum fees to ensure that, you know, industry is contributing but not being asked to carry a load so that it can\u2019t invest.", "9136 And again, provincial and municipal governments, you can recommend to them how to address the affordability problem. We think it\u2019s been identified. And it would be perfectly appropriate for you to issue a report or a call to action that Social Assistance programs now need to take into account this basic necessity.", "9137 You could encourage government to promote digital literacy; very important. But again, I don\u2019t think necessarily a mandated regulatory initiative. But an awareness initiative and one you could ask governments to direct some resources towards.", "9138 So that\u2019s really, in a nutshell, our proposal.", "9139 THE CHAIRPERSON: I notice that excluded from this list -- and I\u2019m not sure if it was by choice or shortness of time -- are First Nations and Indigenous peoples who in some instances have self-governing territories. ", "9140 MR. MALCOLMSON: It was late and it\u2019s an oversight that we didn\u2019t identify them as a specific heading here. But we look at those organizations as part of government so they would fall into the municipal local government basket.", "9141 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So your concept of local government is broader than -- you\u2019re not suggesting that they\u2019re emanations of the federal government.", "9142 MR. MALCOLMSON: No.", "9143 THE CHAIRPERSON: When you look at this list in your appendix here, are there linkages that we should be aware of? Just by way of example, your capital cost allowance acceleration. To what extent does that flow back, for instance, on some of your other proposals? Because it gets into a mix into the financing presumably, or maybe not. ", "9144 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, you\u2019re right. There is a linkage to the extent that government tax policy creates an environment where it\u2019s more attractive to invest. Then that enables additional investment which could enable, you know, the regulator to direct investment obligations. All of it works together to facilitate the deployment of resources to your goals so there is a linkage.", "9145 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you think there are other linkages? I gave that as an example. I\u2019m not sure if there are any others. ", "9146 Do you want to take some time and maybe do it through an undertaking to see if there are things that are co-dependent?", "9147 MR. MALCOLMSON: My colleague Mr. Daniels would like to offer you some comments, and then we would take an undertaking if you feel it\u2019s necessary.", "9148 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "9149 MR. DANIELS: I just wanted to give an example of something in terms of what we\u2019ve heard a lot about in this proceeding on the affordability issue.", "9150 As we said, you\u2019ve heard us about being a poverty issue. But I think what was enlightening to us, and I think presumably to yourself and others, is just to the extent that when we looked at this throughout this proceeding the evidence that came up especially -- and you\u2019ve heard it as well from the ACORN individuals who sat here and told you their stories.", "9151 But people are taking the internet and using the internet, and using it at different levels based on their needs which really suggests that it\u2019s not an access problem but that it\u2019s a poverty issue. You\u2019ve heard us on that. ", "9152 We think that that\u2019s an example of something where the evidence that you\u2019ve collected, which may not be a focus of what the provincial governments are looking at that, you know, being able to direct and to give advice, that this is what we\u2019ve discovered, and this is how people are using the internet at different levels and based on their needs but really what they\u2019re giving up. Because that\u2019s what we heard a lot about, what people are giving up in terms of on other aspects. That\u2019s something where you could, you know, provide useful advice.", "9153 And then as you see and what are suggestions here again for the linkages, is we see a role where you could actually report and be a conduit of where people could know, oh, for Social Assistance what\u2019s available in terms of from this perspective; how is this treated? Actually report on that on an annual basis.", "9154 So it\u2019s just I guess I\u2019m trying to give you an example based on your question of how I see these working together from a coordination perspective to achieve collectively our goals.", "9155 THE CHAIRPERSON: And that\u2019s useful but it only brings us so far in terms of the inter-dependencies here. It\u2019s Shakespeare that wrote that \u201cmodest doubt is the beacon of the wise.\u201d And I always hesitate to jump in without making -- getting a little bit more context.", "9156 So it would appear that there may be other inter-dependencies and I would appreciate your views on it. And that therefore others, having seen your views, will be able to comment on it as well.", "9157 MR. MALCOLMSON: So we\u2019re happy to give that some more thought in the form of an undertaking.", "9158 ", "UNDERTAKING", "9159 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "9160 What role -- I mean, when you were presenting this you said, well, the Commission could do this, the Commission could do this. What role do you see other champions playing?", "9161 MR. MALCOLMSON: Other champions being?", "9162 THE CHAIRPERSON: I don\u2019t know. Other leaders in the stakeholder community, some of your CEOs, for instance, ministers. ", "9163 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, I think the role that industry can and should play -- which is why we focused on it -- is being the champion of the build out of next generation infrastructure. I think that is the role for industry. That is what we should be focused on. That is what we should be incented to do. And so that would be our role.", "9164 I think the other champions are obviously the regulator and government, and we\u2019ve provided our views on the roles that those two agencies can play.", "9165 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. I\u2019ll give you an example. Say for a given that the issue of poverty is best dealt with at the provincial funding level, which is your argument. Just assume that; that we\u2019ve bought into that. That we make that recommendation.", "9166 To what extent would the CEOs of the private sector, in light of their broader social responsibilities and as opinion leaders, what would they do and what should they do?", "9167 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, I think all of the large industry players play important roles in the social responsibility initiatives. They choose which ones they wish to focus on. ", "9168 As you know, at Bell we focused on mental health. That's the cause that we've championed. Within the sphere that we're talking about today in terms of accessibility, deployment, and adoption, we've also focused on digital literacy and become a champion of digital literacy because we recognize that one of the issues is a lack of adoption.", "9169 So that is a role we've chosen to play as well. I can take you through what we do in the area of digital literacy, but you may already know, but --- ", "9170 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, it's not so much that. I'm still at the level of to what extent do other players step up? It's one thing to say -- because it may be perceived that your position is one that you, the Commission, shouldn't do this, others should do it. And I'm not questioning the authenticity of your position, but then it may be perceived as then it goes into this big dark hole. ", "9171 And I see CEOs, even associations of CEOs taking on some issues in Canadian society, and so I'm wondering to what extent above and beyond some of the social responsibility -- I'm not putting those into doubt or question -- to what extent would the CEOs, as opinion leaders and influence makers, step up in some of these issues? ", "9172 So, unfortunately Mr. Cope is not here, so I can't ask him directly.", "9173 MR. MALCOLMSON: Nor can I answer directly, just for the record. ", "9174 You know, the CEOs of all the companies have, as I said, have an important role in corporate social responsibility. The nice thing about this country is that they're free to choose which ones they wish to focus on. ", "9175 We focused on mental health, we focused on digital literacy, and our focus as a company is on the build out of infrastructure. ", "9176 We're network builders, so we've come to you today saying that our primary goal and the primary role we can play, the contribution we can make is building out that infrastructure in communities where it doesn\u2019t exist today. And that, in and of itself, will perform a very valuable social function.", "9177 THE CHAIRPERSON: So we've discussed sort of the governance around this, and your document is helpful. I\u2019ll see if I have further questions after the lunch break.", "9178 But in terms of outcomes, in your presentation today, you -- perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but you seem to frame it that the principal outcome is bridging the gap for the four percent of households that do not have access to five and one? Is that the only outcome, if you were thinking of a broader blueprint? ", "9179 MR. MALCOLMSON: We say it's the principal outcome because it's one we think that is both realistic, practical, and something that you are able to accomplish without going through the whole sort of patchwork quilt of coordination that we talked about earlier. ", "9180 So that's why we say it's the principal outcome. There are other equally important outcomes around adoption and around dealing with the poverty issue, so we see three parallel issues that need to be addressed and hopefully there are three outcomes that solve each of those three issues.", "9181 THE CHAIRPERSON: And we'll unpack those at some point later on, but right now, I was going to ask you a few questions about potential overarching principles that we might want to think about in a strategy. ", "9182 Do you have any -- well, here, maybe I'll put some to you and you can tell me whether you agree with them.", "9183 For instance, could we say that while working with other stakeholders and taking into account competitive markets, that the private sector should play a leadership role in developing and operating broadband networks and services for Canadians? ", "9184 MR. MALCOLMSON: As a principle, the private sector should perform a role in operating networks? Sorry, I just --- ", "9185 THE CHAIRPERSON: In the development and operation. ", "9186 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes. ", "9187 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you agree with the principle that all Canadians should have access to the social, cultural, and economic benefits delivered through broadband networks in such applications as e-learning, e-health, e-government, and e-business?", "9188 MR. MALCOLMSON: We would agree that all Canadians should have access, taking into account that the terms and conditions associated with access may differ based on where they live. ", "9189 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you agree with the principle that in defining broadband infrastructure development initiatives, government should achieve sustainable broadband access to every public institution, public library, health care centre, or other designated public access point in the country?", "9190 MR. MALCOLMSON: I'm not sure I'm comfortable recommending what government should or should not do, other than playing a role in funding. I think it's up to government to decide once the broadband problem has been identified what role they want to play inside that.", "9191 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, we -- just the level of principles here. Surely, if we're giving ourselves objectives we should be able to jointly define them, and I'm just testing with you. ", "9192 And you don\u2019t think that's -- is it your not feeling comfortable telling government what to do? You should probably close down your government relations shop. ", "9193 MR. MALCOLMSON: I think the principle you articulated is a laudable principle for government to pursue. ", "9194 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you agree that another principle could be working with other stakeholders; communities should be engaging in identifying local needs and network options, in developing capacity at the local level to use and gain value from broadband networks --- ", "9195 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes. ", "9196 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- as well as ensuring that economic development plans and initiatives incorporate broadband services and content? ", "9197 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes. ", "9198 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm not making these up, by the way. ", "9199 MR. MALCOLMSON: I didn\u2019t think you were. ", "9200 THE CHAIRPERSON: They come from a report by a certain David Johnson, when in 2001, he and many others in the country developed a report, the report on the National Broadband Task Force called \"The New National Dream: Networking the Nation for Broadband Access\".

MALCOLMSON: I can't say that I reviewed it prior to the hearing and the way my memory is these days, if I don\u2019t review it prior to the hearing I forget it immediately, so --- ", "9203 THE CHAIRPERSON: We all do. ", "9204 But it seems to me that considerable effort had been made in actually defining some of the outcomes. I guess some of them trickled through to a certain degree, but others maybe less, and perhaps I'll give you homework over the lunch break, which we're about to take, to have a look at those principles -- there are a total of nine -- and tell me whether you continue to agree with them or not, to frame a strategy. ", "9205 MR. MALCOLMSON: We will take a look at them over our lunch break, Mr. Chairman. ", "9206 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, we can provide you a web reference to it, if that is helpful, if Mr. Google hasn\u2019t done the job already.

MALCOLMSON: That's the exhibit which was the one-pager attached to our presentation? ", "9213 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, I'd assume that that was merely an annexe to your presentation. It's the more detailed costing, I think (inaudible). ", "9214 MR. MALCOLMSON: We have not added it as an exhibit, but with your permission, we will, and it is --- ", "9215 THE CHAIRPERSON: I assume that that's what you were doing when you were referring to it.

", "9219 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- and share copies so everyone will know what we're talking about, okay? ", "9220 MR. MALCOLMSON: Thank you. ", "9221 THE CHAIRPERSON: So we'll take a break and let's come back at 1:15. ", "9222 Thank you.", "--- Upon recessing at 11:56 a.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 1:16 p.m.", "9223 THE CHAIRPERSON: \u00c0 l\u2019ordre, s\u2019il vous plait. ", "9224 Order, please.", "9225 So we\u2019ll be hearing next not from Bell because they\u2019ve kindly agreed to set back so we can hear from Mr. John Rae.", "9226 Mr. Rae, just so you know, up here there\u2019s a panel of five Commissioners. Myself, the Chairman, Jean-Pierre Blais. I\u2019ve got with me here as well Vice-chair Menzies, Commissioner Chris MacDonald, Commissioner Candice Molnar, and Commissioner Linda Vennard.", "9227 So you can go ahead, and we\u2019re listening.", "PRESENTATION ", "9228 MR. RAE: Oh, there we go. I can make technology work today. That\u2019s amazing. Technology and me doesn\u2019t get on too well most of the time. ", "9229 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for introducing all the Commissioners. That\u2019s very helpful.", "9230 I appreciate the opportunity to have been able to switch my time. After your schedule came out and even before then when I submitted my request to appear, later I got -- the organization I\u2019m involved with got invited to appear before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights this morning to discuss the renewal of the Court Challenges Program.", "9231 So instead of appearing by video conference from Toronto, which I\u2019ve done in the past and which works very very well, here I am in person. ", "9232 And also, I want to thank the delegation from Bell for extending their lunch break so that I could start my presentation right after lunch. Thank you, gentlemen. That was very kind of you.", "9233 As the record will show, Mr. Chairman and Commissioners, this is not my first time here. And so I\u2019m glad that I haven\u2019t totally worn out my welcome yet because until I achieve my goals I will keep coming back and coming back, although I hope that the need for me to keep coming back will soon go away. ", "9234 But it will only go away when I achieve my objectives, which are full equality, a recognition of a better way to provide technical support, the initiation of universal design, and full access to receiving a television program, whether that program is broadcast over cable or other platforms. ", "9235 So I assume you\u2019ve figured out what all that means, right? I\u2019ve come here looking for more regulation on the part of the CRTC in that list. I appreciate what the Commission has done in the past, but I\u2019ve always called for more and here I am again. My message hasn\u2019t changed.", "9236 The notion that our equality should be left to the marketplace has never worked in the past, isn\u2019t working now, and so there\u2019s no reason to expect me to believe that somehow out of a bottle I can find -- I can coax out an equality genie that will suddenly make things equal, accessible, and usable. ", "9237 And the notion of what is accessible and what is usable you would think would go hand in hand. Well, they should be they don\u2019t always. And I know that even this morning there was some discussion of access, but it was from a standpoint of affordability. Clearly that is a topic that is of great concern to the disabled community because our community -- too many of our community continue to subsist in abject poverty.", "9238 But rather than go up that road, I want to take the discussion of access and usability in different directions. One of those is -- and here, Commissioners, I\u2019m not picking on the sectors that you regulate. No, I\u2019m not. The issues I talk about are endemic so I\u2019m not picking on your sector at all, although while I\u2019m here I guess I will.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "9239 I take liberties once in a while, Commissioners, you know. ", "9240 So the first issue then is websites. There is a need to make them better. Some websites that may be technically accessible often aren\u2019t terribly usable. What do I mean by the difference?", "9241 If I can\u2019t find what\u2019s on a website, even if that website is supposedly accessible, doesn\u2019t help the provider, it doesn\u2019t help me. So that\u2019s what I mean when I talk about the difference between what may be accessible and what\u2019s usable.", "9242 Second aspect is how much PDF is on websites and whether those PDF files are accessible. It depends how the file is created. Too often I deal with a file, I open it up, and I get -- and my screen reader says those two words that I hate to hear, \u201cEmpty document.\u201d", "9243 Well, chances are the document isn\u2019t empty. Chances are it may be completely full of text, but if my screen reader thinks that that text is a scanned image it think it\u2019s a picture. And if it thinks it\u2019s a picture it doesn\u2019t know what to do with a picture and I get \u201cempty document\u201d. It still happens too much of the time and it need not be that way.", "9244 So the solutions for that are either to make sure that a document is created accessibly or stop using PDF to start with. You know, use text, or if you insist upon using PDF also put up a text equivalent. ", "9245 When we also think about accessibility, as we all hear nowadays more and more Canadians are giving up their cable subscriptions all together in favour of accessing television programming through alternate platforms. Well, that sounds okay in theory but for us that same program which may come with audio description when it\u2019s broadcast over my television set, chances are these days will not have that same described audio track when it is broadcast over another platform. ", "9246 And that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling upon the Commission to regulate television distribution over alternate platforms. We need the same level of access, and I demand the same level of access over those platforms as I get through my television set, right, through my television set. That is, if my set-top box makes it possible for me to find where the described audio channel is.", "9247 Fortunately, my provider is Rogers. And thanks to one of your previous proceedings -- they never advertise this but it came out through one of your proceedings so I\u2019m glad you hold these proceedings, Commissioners. I discovered the existence of a special remote with one-button access. Pushing one button I can switch between a described version and a non-described version of a program, assuming the description is there.", "9248 So if my sighted friends don\u2019t want the description, although there\u2019s a good chance they actually prefer it as well, not just me, but if they don\u2019t it\u2019s easy to switch. And what is more important for me, it\u2019s easy for me to put it back on should they watch TV late at night at my place and leave it off. ", "9249 Well, a lot of other cable providers use set-top boxes that are nowhere near this easy. I understand that progress is coming but, you know, I\u2019m getting old. And the whole notion of incremental progress is something I\u2019m getting a little impatient about, I must say.", "9250 And the other real major irritant in my life is the kind of technical support that is available. I\u2019m going to be charitable. It\u2019s not my nature, Commissioners, but I\u2019m going to be a little charitable today. When I categorize technical support available to a blind customer as woefully inadequate it\u2019s not the words I usually use but I\u2019m being charitable this afternoon. ", "9251 Too often when I call up my provider, tell him I have a problem with my internet, they ask me, \u201cIs the green light on? How many lights are on your modem?\u201d And this is after I\u2019ve told them I\u2019m totally blind. Do they not understand what \u201ctotally blind\u201d means? It seems like they don\u2019t.", "9252 And none of them have a clue how to assist a blind person who uses screen reader. None of them. It is woefully adequate.", "9253 So what, of course, I\u2019m recommending is that each supplier, each provider train some of its technical support staff to understand how to deal with a customer who has a screen reader. They don\u2019t need to train all of them, although that wouldn\u2019t hurt, but no, we don\u2019t need that. We need some number of dedicated staff and that when a blind person has a technical problem and regardless what time of day that technical problem occurs, I can call -- we can call our provider, identify ourselves as a blind person and be sure that we can get technical support that will help us.", "9254 So you see, Commissioners, there are unmet needs and that\u2019s why people like me continue to come back and ask you to do more, not less, when it comes to regulating the industry that you have the power and the authority to regulate.", "9255 Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here.", "9256 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you for being there and for your frank comments. Commissioner MacDonald may have some questions for you.", "9257 MR. RAE: Sure.", "9258 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Good afternoon. I do have a few quick questions. You were talking a lot about the interactions with your service provider and where they may be failing to meet some of your specific requirements. Are there particular steps or changes in their procedures and processes that you\u2019d recommend they put in place? Or are there any other companies that really do a much better job in servicing their customers with disabilities that perhaps you could point to? Other companies or organizations that some of these service providers can learn some lessons from.", "9259 MR. RAE: Better companies? Yes. But none in Canada. Not here. There\u2019s Comcast in the United States that seems far ahead in terms of providing this sort of thing, also provides access to a TV guide that a blind person can access. So I think the leader is Comcast in the United States or there\u2019s companies in the United Kingdom.", "9260 But instead of trying to bring the technology that has been available in the United Kingdom for some years, the Canadian approach has been wait for the U.S. Wait for the U.S. and then we\u2019ll think about doing something.", "9261 Well, hopefully that\u2019s getting closer.", "9262 As far as the technical support issue, it\u2019s the comment I made that each provider -- and while I obviously know my own best anecdotal, comments that I\u2019ve heard from other members of the blind community lead me to believe that their competitors or companies in other parts of Canada are by no means any better. Not any better at all.", "9263 So one thing is what I propose that each of these companies needs to train some of its technical support staff to understand the needs of a blind customer who uses a screen reader. That can be done and I believe it should be.", "9264 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay. Thank you. And I guess maybe I should have asked this question first because we\u2019re talking about the support you receive. What about before you actually sign up for a new service? Can you speak to, you know, the challenges that you face when you\u2019re trying to shop around for an internet service or a wireless or television service between the different providers? And, you know, if they\u2019ve got specialized plans that would target your unique needs or how they make it easy or difficult to find the solution that would best suit your personal needs.", "9265 MR. RAE: Thank you. Yes, thank you for that question.", "9266 Well, there\u2019s several aspects to the answer to that question, sir. In terms of cell phones, I think it\u2019s now required that each provider have at least one that\u2019s accessible. But you have more choice than we do. So I think it\u2019s reasonable for us to expect better.", "9267 Access to information is always an issue for us. And whether it\u2019s possible to get information about plans or that sort of thing in a format we can read, and that\u2019s the issue, of course. Today it seems like the internet is king in almost all aspects of life. I wish it wasn\u2019t quite that way.", "9268 And again, the issue may be finding what you need. For example, as a result of your regulatory work, we now have access to take and pay option, I think. I think we do. I admit I have not spent an exhaustive amount of time looking for it on Rogers, but I couldn\u2019t find it when I made a quick look. I do assume it\u2019s there somewhere but I couldn\u2019t find it. I admit I need to spend more time looking than I have so far, but if it\u2019s there, and I assume it is, it wasn\u2019t easy to find.", "9269 So access to information about what products are available, what -- and especially what plans are available can be a bit difficult. It\u2019s difficult. It can be.", "9270 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: With respect to the pricing of some of those plans, we heard from the CNIB earlier today and in their submission to us they noted that people with disabilities often face challenges in finding employment, and oftentimes they\u2019re tend to be lower income Canadians because they have a hard time finding employment.", "9271 Do you have any thoughts on what the best way is to ensure affordable service for visually impaired Canadians? Is it a mandated package of some kind to meet your needs? Is it additional support from government knowing that you have unique needs? Is it a specialized fund that may be required to offset some of your costs?", "9272 MR. RAE: Well, the best solution, of course, would be to enhance employment equity within this industry and in all other sectors. Not just this industry, all sectors. ", "9273 And that would accomplish two things. It would do something about our chronic and ongoing level of unemployment which is, in my mind, a national disgrace. But it would do more than that. It would bring inside into these -- into companies, whether telecommunications or any other sector. This is not a telecommunication specific issue. It\u2019s endemic across all sectors.", "9274 It would bring inside expertise that sometimes isn\u2019t sufficiently available in-house. And it would make it harder to forget about us when new services are being planned for, when new technology is being designed and manufactured, when new promotional schemes are being thought about, when new commercials to advertise products are being decided upon. So it would have both of those benefits.", "9275 A lot of people say, \u201cWhy would I buy a particular product because there\u2019s nobody in your commercial that looks like me?\u201d Well, from time to time there\u2019s no reason why they couldn\u2019t include a person with a disability using one of their accessible products. There\u2019s no reason why that couldn\u2019t be done.", "9276 We recommend it should happen more often because that would not only be a signal to our community -- and I think that\u2019s to businesses\u2019 benefit, you know, that they are interested in our share of the market. And although we\u2019re poor, we do comprise one seventh of the population so there\u2019s a -- there is a considerable purchasing power available to them if they made themselves more accessible, more attractive to our community.", "9277 So not only would it do something about our employment, it would bring needed expertise in-house, and I believe that that would lead to the development of better products, more accessible products.", "9278 And as a trading nation, I think from a business standpoint, what we may develop in Canada that's accessible could be of value in an export sense to other countries around the world who are doing more and more now that more and more countries have signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as of course Canada did when it became available for signature.", "9279 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that.", "9280 Just one final question. Is there any particular reason or can you share your thoughts on why you think that perhaps servicing customers with disabilities and getting more customers with disabilities onto their networks doesn\u2019t appear to be a major focus of the communications companies today?", "9281 MR. RAE: I would suggest that there's a lot of assumptions at play, perhaps some measure of stigma as opposed, an assumption that we are sufficiently poor and that maybe they aren't going to attract our business, or an assumption that, you know, we are going to take up the products like everybody else does.", "9282 I think there's a lot of assumptions at play. I think a lot of those assumptions are fallacious and not really based on fact because, you know, although our community is amongst the poorest of the poor in this country, a growing number of people in the blind community seem to have cell phones and all that sort of thing.", "9283 I personally don\u2019t. People say I need one. They say I need -- they need to be able to find me more easily. I say I'm not that important. You don\u2019t need to and, of course, usually I am out. I bet almost everybody in this room has one. So I say when I'm out with people, why do I need one? The rest of you have them. I don\u2019t need one, but I really don\u2019t want one.", "9284 And for me, these touchtone fancy phones that more and more members of the blind community are using and using effectively, to me something that has a flat screen, whether it's a telephone or a range at home or whether it's a stereo system, to me a flat screen just isn\u2019t accessible, not accessible in my mind. I want buttons. I want buttons.", "9285 So there we go. But it's a question of choice, a question of when one gets used to. Many of us have -- seem to have mastered the mysteries of technology that I think are a bit beyond me, but anyway.", "9286 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I can relate. I've had some choice words for my own iPad over the years trying to get the touchscreen to work.", "9287 MR. RAE: I can believe that.", "9288 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Those are my questions. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll hand you back over to the Chair.", "9289 MR. RAE: Thank you.", "9290 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just checking if colleagues have questions. No, apparently not.", "9291 So thank you very much for participating in the hearing.", "9292 MR. RAE: Thank you, Commissioners, for the opportunity. I appreciate it very much.", "9293 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "9294 MR. RAE: Good afternoon.", "9295 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "9296 THE SECRETARY: We will now ask Bell Canada to come back to the presentation table.", "9297 --- (A short pause/Courte pause)", "PRESENTATION (Continued)", "9298 THE CHAIRPERSON: Welcome back and thank you for accommodating the previous intervenor. It's much appreciated.", "9299 So why don\u2019t we pick up where we left off and where we left was I was asking you if you agreed with the principles, the nine principles identified in the Task Force Report, and I think that was your homework over lunchtime. So you probably had time to have a look at it and reflect on it.", "9300 I was wondering if you had views whether you think those are still valid principles or not?", "9301 MR. MALCOLMSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.", "9302 We did have an opportunity to review the principles and what we can say to you at this time is, at a very high level, they could serve as useful guideposts for government, for industry, for the regulator. So they're a useful perhaps road map for future planning.", "9303 I was struck when we looked -- we had a little bit of time to look at the overall report as well and there are some interesting facts in there given that the report was written in 2001 when we were collectively striving for a speed of 1.5 megs and 25 percent of the country\u2019s population was not connected even to that speed. So there is an element of, you know, looking back. We should probably be proud of what we've been able to collectively accomplish now that we have 96 percent at 5 megs. But we would ---", "9304 THE CHAIRPERSON: By the same token, it would seem we may have -- the numbers may have changed but would you agree that the broad analytical framework seems to still be relevant?", "9305 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes. This framework is relevant and useful and what I was going to say to you, Mr. Chairman, is we would like an opportunity to walk through the principles in a written undertaking just so that you have our written comments on the record.", "9306 ", "UNDERTAKING", "9307 THE CHAIRPERSON: Sure, appreciate that. That's good, yes. So, as you know, it's all May 5th for that unless you think that that's unreasonable.", "9308 Now, in your original filings, you advocated for government policies that I see are sometimes brought back. We mentioned earlier the capital cost allowance acceleration. You had advocated as well using some of the spectrum auction revenues to finance certain initiatives.", "9309 Since then, there's been a federal election, a speech from the throne, a federal budget. I\u2019m sure you were active throughout that in terms of putting forward your policy advice to various players and those ideas didn't seem to have traction, at least so far.", "9310 Would that be a correct conclusion to draw?", "9311 MR. MALCOLMSON: That the ideas in our original finding failed at this proceeding?", "9312 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, that the capital cost allowance, I haven\u2019t seen that being picked up.", "9313 MR. MALCOLMSON: It wasn\u2019t adopted in the most recent budget, no.", "9314 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So would you agree with me that that's not getting much traction?", "9315 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well again, Mr. Chairman, I'm an optimist. So we will continue to advocate for that because we think it's good for network investment and infrastructure.", "9316 THE CHAIRPERSON: And would you agree with me as well that using spectrum auction revenues does not, at this stage, seem to have gotten much traction either?", "9317 MR. MALCOLMSON: Again, I think it may be early days. The government is new. Clearly what got traction is the need to invest in broadband, which we were encouraged by.", "9318 THE CHAIRPERSON: But there's a lot of programs and there is, from what I've known being outside government, a dislike especially at the Department of Finance for having dedicated funds and dedicated sources for money. And in a sense taking dedicated money from revenues from spectrum auction is not something that -- well, would it be fair to say that Canada -- I don\u2019t think Canada has ever done that.", "9319 MR. MALCOLMSON: Not to my knowledge.", "9320 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So it would be a bit of a departure, would it not?", "9321 MR. MALCOLMSON: Could be.", "9322 THE CHAIRPERSON: So why should the CRTC be taking the championship of some of these ideas concerning, for instance, allocation of capital costs?", "9323 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, we're saying that if you take on the role of providing comprehensive advice reporting, whatever you want to call it, to government that we believe that that is a worthy initiative to continue to put forward.", "9324 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "9325 MR. MALCOLMSON: And we would hope perhaps with ---", "9326 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, from an optimist, sometimes I wonder whether it's wise to be a Don Quichotte, but I take your point.", "9327 Let me now turn to the issue of coordinating funding or initiatives and actions, and both implicitly and explicitly in your position, there should -- you're saying that there should be a complementarity between a potential CRTC funding mechanism and an existing -- or existing, because I guess it would be plural -- it could be at provincial levels -- shouldn't always assume it's a federal program, but the -- with government programs generally.", "9328 In practical terms, we know that there are at least 14 jurisdictions with each their own revolving electoral cycles, budget cycles, compounded by budget secrecy. And presumably when you or others make applications to funding programs, until decisions are made, all that is confidential. ", "9329 So I was hoping you could help me understand how, in practice, we can assure that complementarity.", "9330 Mr. Daniels has a thought. ", "9331 MR. DANIELS: So the way we look at this in terms of our emphasis, and I agree with you in terms of it's (inaudible) difficult in terms of all the provinces and territorial governments and other funding institutions. ", "9332 The way we were thinking about this, in terms of right now, was really between the CRTC, coordination between the CRTC and the federal government, in terms of -- because we think that there's enough money, as you saw from earlier, that we could get the job done of building a broadband across the country, of five and one. ", "9333 But where does provincial governments play, because there could be role for provincial governments playing and we actually listed that in the appendix that we talked about. ", "9334 Often what happens is, sometimes they're separate funding initiatives, and often what happens though is -- well, we saw in Connecting Canadians, is a number of providers went to provincial governments and used them to actually help them finance the ISP's portion of whatever proposal they were putting forward.", "9335 So I think that's been done in terms of partnering there. ", "9336 And so the way I view it is if we have a national solution between the CRTC and the federal government, in terms of coordination, there still may be a role for provincials, governments and territories to actually help with the business case when it's not entirely there, because that's generally what's on a 50/50 sharing arrangement, so that's how it would feed in. ", "9337 THE CHAIRPERSON: So normally it's 50/50 between the provider and the government? ", "9338 MR. DANIELS: Yeah, so the way Connecting Canadians works is -- and Connecting Canadians only looked at capital costs, and we can talk about -- we have a slightly different proposal other than what -- than for satellite communities, which again, was different. ", "9339 But generally, Connecting Canadians, the way it worked was that the individual provider, the ISP, had to put in 50 percent and the federal government would match the 50 percent. ", "9340 There was exceptions made for First Nations, where the federal government funding would go up to 75 percent, and there was exceptions made for something called the northern component, which was the satellite solution, which was really just given to SSi and Nunavik, what you\u2019ve heard about from KRG.", "9341 THE CHAIRPERSON: So I'm still -- even if you're thinking about in just coordinating with the federal funding formula, one could have -- one wouldn't necessarily be addressing the patchwork result, because a particular province with more resources or higher priorities in a particular area might step in and skew the outcomes, whereas we, the Commission, have to be concerned about national outcomes, do we not? ", "9342 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes, you do have to be concerned about national outcomes, and you know, at the end of the day, coordination may or may not be perfect. It depends on the willingness of those involved to coordinate, so that's why we put our proposal forward to say it would be great to have a national coordinated strategy with all agencies working in synch, but to the extent that that doesn\u2019t happen or takes time to happen, what can the Commission do now?", "9343 And that was sort of the spirit in which we put our proposal forward. You can start now connecting Canadians to five and one speeds in remote areas through a reallocation of a funding mechanism you control. That's why we put our proposal on the table, because it's doable. ", "9344 THE CHAIRPERSON: In your recommendation, you would have us, if I understand correctly, have an aution process, a kind of RFP, to allocate funding; would that be correct?", "9345 MR. MALCOLMSON: I'll ask Jonathan to comment in a minute, but yes, it would be an auction and the governing principle of the auction would be that the lowest cost bidder is the successful candidate, we think, because that, in other auctions, has meant that you can stretch subsidy dollars further. ", "9346 Jonathan may have additional comments. ", "9347 MR. DANIELS: So the way we're thinking about this is that you would set up a program where you would actually indicate up front whatever the criterias are. Everyone needs to know exactly what the criterias are beforehand and we can talk about what those elements would be, but whatever those criterias are, so that by the time that the actual auction happens, that the auction results would be purely objective, based on the least-cost bidder. ", "9348 But as to any concern that we have in terms of the nature of the auction, for example, what's the minimum speed that you have to provide, five and one, that has to be established up front, but that there wouldn't be subjectivity in the analysis, once the auction actually happened. That would be in the design of the auction. ", "9349 THE CHAIRPERSON: I notice you mention that it should be multi-round. You don\u2019t mean that the auction keeps going for a particular (inaudible) different rounds depending on targeted needs across the country? Is that how you would see it?", "9350 MR. DANIELS: I think we were just throwing out that there's different ways of actually going about doing the auction, in terms of design. I don\u2019t -- we're not stuck on one method. It could be just a single round bid and so on. ", "9351 I think what we've meant, in terms of the multi-rounds, was specifically referring to, if I recall correctly, the determination up front whether a community is either terrestrial or satellite.", "9352 Under our proposal, terrestrial gets treated completely differently from a satellite community, and so in order to decide up front whether a community is terrestrial or satellite, there would be a round of determination. Once that determination is made, it could be a single-round auction for that community. ", "9353 THE CHAIRPERSON: For communities across the country? ", "9354 MR. DANIELS: I'm sorry?", "9355 THE CHAIRPERSON: For potentially communities across the country or bundles of communities? ", "9356 MR. DANIELS: That's right. It's bundles of communities. So the way we have suggested it is that actually it would be the smallest region that any bidder -- when you design the location, it should be the smallest region that any bidder wanted, so that we shouldn't be advantaged by being a national provider by putting bundles together, various -- and an example of that that we had ourselves on the other end is we didn\u2019t bid in Connecting Canadians for Nunavut because it was bundled together as entirely all of Nunavut. ", "9357 We actually have service and capable of providing service in part of Nunavut and five communities, which -- four communities in Nunavut that we -- so we would have liked to have seen that broken off, because it probably would have resulted in a lower overall payment. ", "9358 So our proposal from the design would be, it's the smallest region that any one provider would say, so you build up from the Connecting Canadians or your own maps and the smallest region that would be collectively put together. ", "9359 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would the process be used, for instance, in radio calls to define where needs are? Is that something that should inspire us in having a means to decide where to launch RFPs and how to scope it out? ", "9360 MR. MALCOLMSON: So an initial market assessment, like you do in --- ", "9361 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, I'm speaking by analogy, not necessarily. It's because I think there is a --I mean, your point being is that once you set the rules, you're not supposed to fiddle around with the rules, right? So you have to have some sort of process to decide what your bidding would be. So it's almost a request for interest round ahead of the RFP. ", "9362 MR. DANIELS: I think that's the kind of thing that we're talking about. The only difference, I'd say, is I think that the starting point would be an updated mapping process to make sure that we have the latest of -- you know, which I know the Commission has been working on, in terms of working from the maps. But we sort of thought at the end -- or sorry, let me rephrase that -- at the beginning, we want to capture all areas that aren't covered at five and one. ", "9363 THE CHAIRPERSON: And then one presumably has to triage them as to what makes sense, in terms of a bundle of places?", "9364 MR. DANIELS: Yes, and that's what we meant by the first round, in terms of deciding the nature and the structure of the auction. That's correct.", "9365 So in terms of design, what would be the criteria?", "9366 MR. DANIELS: We think that, one, it should be technically neutral with the exception of satellite, which again, I\u2019m happy to go into in terms of from a satellite community.", "9367 We\u2019ve proposed that from a time perspective that the commitment would be for five years. Now, in terms of the winner who wins the bid would have an obligation, a contractual obligation, to provide service in that community for five years\u2019 time. It\u2019s three years in satellite communities.", "9368 We think that in terms of from a price perspective that you can borrow from sort of the approach that\u2019s been done in other auctions like Connecting Canadians. And so we\u2019ve actually proposed that there should be a requirement that the winner would have rates, terms, and conditions that are comparable to competitive offerings offered in non-subsidy areas within the same province or territory. ", "9369 And there could be other parameters that the Commission could establish going down, but I think high level those are sort of the key factors that people need to know. And there would also be a timeline by when which you need to launch.", "9370 The way we see this just from a mechanic perspective, which is different, there\u2019s a few things different from Connecting Canadians. But the way we see this from a financial perspective, Connecting Canadians pays up front. ", "9371 If the CRTC is running this and using contribution mechanism, the providers would know that they would receive a monthly supplement payment just in the same way that contribution works today for local voice. So you would know you would get that, in the case of terrestrial for five years and satellite for three years, upon which in the satellite case there would be a renewal. ", "9372 THE CHAIRPERSON: So an earmark within the contribution mechanism would be the mechanism you -- because we don\u2019t issue cheques per se like the government would.", "9373 MR. DANIELS: That\u2019s right. We\u2019re suggesting to the extent that the CRTC does it. And again, we think that it would be great if, you know, that it was coordinated with the government so that -- but yes.", "9374 THE CHAIRPERSON: Tell me more about why the special rules for satellite communities.", "9375 MR. DANIELS: So and I think you\u2019ve heard some of the intervenors talk about satellite, and I want to be clear. When I\u2019m talking about satellite community or satellite at this point in time, I\u2019m talking about a community whose only access is satellite for the transport as opposed to the DTH Xplornet kind of solution.", "9376 THE CHAIRPERSON: Understood.", "9377 MR. DANIELS: So the difference there is that the primary cost of providing service -- or I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s primary, but the biggest cost inhibitor is actually the transport to satellite. ", "9378 And so that\u2019s not an access to technology; that\u2019s an ongoing operating expense of how much you have to pay to a satellite provider like Telesat on a monthly basis for transponder space. ", "9379 So what we realized is that -- and we even saw this in Connecting Canadians that they had a different approach for satellite communities -- is that in Connecting Canadians they allocated money to pay for the capital cost to build the infrastructure for a terrestrial community. And then it\u2019s, like, we\u2019re going to give you enough money, you have a five-year obligation and then it\u2019s done. And that\u2019s enough to bring broadband to that community.", "9380 But in a satellite community it\u2019s often not the issue of access. For example, in the numbers that we filed there\u2019s a number of communities that already have the physical capability of providing 5 and 1 but it\u2019s the monthly payments to Telesat or whoever else is the satellite provider that\u2019s the problem. And so that\u2019s going to be ongoing. So you need a different mechanism for an ongoing subsidy. ", "9381 But we also recognize that in terms of funding we set only a three-year window because there\u2019s -- you\u2019ve heard it here extensively -- there\u2019s big changes coming in satellite and the costs could plummet over the next few years. And so we thought five years was too long for a commitment for the operating expense for a satellite so that\u2019s why we narrowed it down to a three-year commitment, knowing that at that point there would have to be a renew in auction.", "9382 And one other thing I just point out is that because it\u2019s ongoing for a subsidy perspective that\u2019s why, another reason why the CRTC is best placed to handle G and H1. You\u2019re better set up to do an ongoing subsidy.", "9383 THE CHAIRPERSON: And ongoing as opposed to a one-off contribution?", "9384 MR. DANIELS: A one-off, which is part of our reason -- not solely but part of our reason why we said focus on G and H1. Which isn\u2019t entirely -- they\u2019re still terrestrial in G and H1, but there\u2019s also satellite in G and H1.", "9385 THE CHAIRPERSON: Now you referred to several existing effective local provincial -- I\u2019m not sure if there were any territorials, maybe -- and federal broadband funding programs. When you look at that suite, whether they still exist or not, which one would you identify as the best practice? ", "9386 MR. MALCOLMSON: We modeled our proposal after Connecting Canadians so that is ---", "9387 THE CHAIRPERSON: Is that an editorial on the other ones or is it merely a question of simplicity?", "9388 MR. MALCOLMSON: No, it\u2019s not an editorial on the other ones. It\u2019s when we were designing ours what looked simplistic, what looked efficient.", "9389 MR. DANIELS: And the only other one I guess we should also point to is we did also use the FCC\u2019s world broadband experiment, which we talked a little bit about because it\u2019s similar to Connecting Canadians but what it did that\u2019s different is it was a true reverse. It was true, what I call a \u201creverse auction\u201d where the lower cost bidder would win. ", "9390 So we also looked at that aspect of it, but I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve looked at every single provincial ---", "9391 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Well, let me try to get at it differently. What are the characteristics and best practices you would like to see when somebody proposes a funding model? Outside of the Commission; I think we\u2019ve dealt with ours. I\u2019m talking about more broadly. What is a ideally suited contribution style government funding?", "9392 MR. DANIELS: So again, I mean, our view is that ultimately it should be the lowest cost bidder should win. That\u2019s probably the most important structure. And that it\u2019s best to have figured out what the criteria are upon which that they\u2019re demanding it should be known beforehand. I think that\u2019s, you know, there may be unique circumstances dealing with different issues on specific ---", "9393 THE CHAIRPERSON: So would a best practice not to do a selective process where too much discretion is involved?", "9394 MR. DANIELS: Yes.", "9395 THE CHAIRPERSON: Because there\u2019s another way of looking at the issue, right?", "9396 MR. DANIELS: Right.", "9397 THE CHAIRPERSON: (Inaudible) practice as well.", "9398 MR. DANIELS: In our view, the best practice is to make it objective, but that could have criteria of all different sorts. We\u2019ve dealt with different criteria and participated in auctions before where partnerships were required and so on and so forth. As long as the requirements are laid out up front that\u2019s what we think is the most important for the structure.", "9399 THE CHAIRPERSON: As far you know, does the existing federal program -- and I know there\u2019s probably going to be a -- in light of the new budget some restatement of the terms and conditions of the new Connection Canadians Program, presumably. ", "9400 But based on the existing program, the one that you know, does the minister retain some sort of discretion at the end as to where the money is assigned notwithstanding an objective formulaic approach? ", "9401 MR. DANIELS: We don\u2019t know.", "9402 THE CHAIRPERSON: You said in one of your findings, and I think it was 13C, that if the Commission were to go down the road of a funding formula we should rely on a third-party expert to assist us in conducting such auctions.", "9403 I was wondering if you could help me understand why you\u2019re making that suggestion, and what kind of expertise would be required?", "9404 MR. DANIELS: I think this was our -- we recognize that you haven\u2019t do this before so I have -- there are consulting firms that exist in the world that have helped regulators and governments structure effective auctions. And so it was merely a statement saying when we were discussing this that we were concerned that we were putting a lot, like, it\u2019s a detailed auction. You know, there may be some structures and how do you do it? But if we were worried that the CRTC may, when looking at this, would say, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have expertise in this.\u201d And our point was to say you can do what other regulators do, which is hire experts to do it.", "9405 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "9406 MR. DANIELS: It was nothing more than that.", "9407 THE CHAIRPERSON: You may not be as aware as I am of the meanderings of federal contracting rules which is just as scary.", "9408 So is this done for the existing government programs, using a third party?", "9409 MR. DANIELS: I don\u2019t know. But my understanding -- and again, I\u2019ve only heard this hearsay, I don\u2019t -- I think governments have used these types of consultabts to structure the spectrum auctions, for example.", "9410 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "9411 MR. DANIELS: But as for Connecting Canadians, I don\u2019t know.", "9412 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Would you be of the view though that to the extent possible the best practices you\u2019ve identified for the CRTC approach to it should be equally valid for a government run program.", "9413 MR. DANIELS: Yes. And that\u2019s to the effect that I guess what we\u2019re trying to say is when the budget came out and it was clear that there was money allocated of the $500 million, although we made the statement in February beforehand, it was our realization thinking maybe there should be a little bit of a shift in our suggestion to you, which is why we\u2019re now saying -- before we were saying just claim your space and set it up. But now that we know that the government has actually allocated money towards it, doesn\u2019t it make sense to you come up with the rules, recommendations as how to design the actual auction and suggest to the government, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take this road and we can take this part of it and you can take that part of it, but we do this in a coordinated fashion and do it together, run the auction similarly together or following the same rules.\u201d I don\u2019t mean it has to be the exact same proceeding. I appreciate that there\u2019s two different institutions and there\u2019s problems with that. But I just mean the coordinated approach. ", "9414 So that\u2019s where our thinking changed slightly from what we had suggested to you before. So we think that the parameters that the hearing you\u2019re running and coming up with all the parameters could be good advice for the government for structuring its auction to the extent that you use the same, you know, saying this is how we\u2019re going about do it and maybe you guys want to follow the similar approach.", "9415 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Have you given any thought -- because there are some examples under broadcasting where the coordination is actually much more aligned. I\u2019m thinking of things such as Musicaction much factor -- not \u201cmuch factor\u201d, just factor -- and the Canada Media fund. Those are other examples where there is actually a CRTC departmental coordination in actually not just the funding but the administration.", "9416 MR. MALCOLMSON: Again, Mr. Chairman, if there was a willingness to do that that makes perfect sense to us because you\u2019re combining resources and achieving efficiency.", "9417 THE CHAIRPERSON: And that makes it easier for those applying?", "9418 MR. MALCOLMSON: I think it makes it easier for whoever\u2019s administering it. I think it makes it easier for those applying and probably yields a more efficient process. And given that we\u2019re either talking about tax dollars in the form of the federal government fund or industry contribution in the form of a contribution regime, we should be looking for efficiency and ensuring that whatever dollars are made available are stretched as far as possible to hit the goal.", "9419 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "9420 Now you\u2019ve made the point that the market forces in the private sector has done a good job in ensuring the rollout of broadband. I was wondering if you could help me understand a little bit more when -- how do you assess in your company that there is no economic case? Do you have a model? Do you have a way of assessing that? And what inputs go into that model?", "9421 MR. MALCOLMSON: I\u2019ll ask Jonathan to comment in a minute. But you know, we make our assessments on a market-by-market basis. And you might say, you know, do you only build in large urban areas? In fact, you know, we have built FTTH out into much smaller communities because the right business case to warrant ---", "9422 THE CHAIRPERSON: Oh, I\u2019m not assuming you\u2019re only doing it certain places. I\u2019m more interested in sort of the inputs you look at and whether there\u2019s anything for us. Because presumably you look at density, you look at cost, number of people, economic profile, geography, I mean, there must be a number of factors. You\u2019re a rational company. You would make rational decisions.", "9423 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes and yes. And, you know, we -- I don\u2019t have the -- a list of metrics of what determines a particular business case decision to invest. That\u2019s not my bailiwick. But we look at markets on a market-by-market basis and make investment decisions based on amount of capital that needs to be deployed to build the infrastructure versus projected rate of return.", "9424 THE CHAIRPERSON: Is there a business process that exists? You\u2019re not reinventing it every time.", "9425 MR. DANIELS: I think in my experience in terms of it can vary depending on the unit that you\u2019re dealing with in the company or the area. So for example, the one I\u2019ll point to is we had previously in another proceeding filed details of the way we actually had a model to decide what community we would go to and not and there was an actual formulistic approach to it. There\u2019s a bunch of managers that went in too. And I think you may be aware and remember something about that model with a bunch of communities that didn\u2019t pass the threshold of certain assumptions had -- related to whole mandated access and soon.", "9426 So that\u2019s an example of how -- at the time that was the Bell line model, how Bell line was deciding what particular community. They actually had a specific model.", "9427 It\u2019s done differently in Bell in Ontario and Quebec and so on. And but I mean, basically we, you know, each company looks at the kind of parameters that you\u2019re talking about, expected market share assumptions, success and so on, and of course, the cost. So, you know, a big issue was -- historically has been the cost of aerial versus buried --", "9428 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "9429 MR. DANIELS: -- lines in community. So there are other factors that clearly come in. And I\u2019m talking about in the case of fibre to home and it\u2019s -- but it\u2019s different in each community we look at.", "9430 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you be willing to share those? There\u2019s a finite number of those models. Perhaps through an undertaking?", "9431 MR. DANIELS: If ---", "9432 THE CHAIRPERSON: There may be confidentiality issues. That\u2019s why I\u2019m suggesting that you may want to do it that way.", "9433 MR. MALCOLMSON: I think on a confidential basis we would be prepared to share parameters.", "9434 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Well, as you know, you know how the rules work about seeking confidentiality. So you should do that if you think it\u2019s appropriate.", "9435 ", "UNDERTAKING", "9436 THE CHAIRPERSON: You probably were listening in or somebody from your company was listening in when Mr. Ryan Adams came to the proceeding. And he had issues with how services were extended in certain communities. What do you say to Mr. Adams?", "9437 MR. GAUVIN: There\u2019s a fairly extensive record on the dispute with Mr. Ryan Adams. I think a lot of the dispute stems from confusion and understandable confusion between the differences and boundaries with the DSA, telephone exchange, a wire centre, a community, and how each are actually funded, sorry, by EWOC or the deferral accounts, and where people actually are.", "9438 So if you\u2019re in a certain community, what\u2019s funded by the deferral account might actually not be the entire community, but certain exchanges or DSAs. Similarly, EWOC might fund certain portions.", "9439 THE CHAIRPERSON: M\u2019hm.", "9440 MR. GAUVIN: And if there\u2019s overlap, then there\u2019s some true up that has to be done. And that actually happened because the timing of the deferral account and the EWOC funding was overlapping. So we had actually won some funding from EWOC and then got the deferral account funding. And what happened is we actually cut cheques back to EWOC based on where we had funding from the deferral account.", "9441 So I think that\u2019s where the confusion stems and, like I said, there\u2019s a fairly extensive record on this in the disputes ---", "9442 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And I don\u2019t necessarily want to get down that road. But perhaps there\u2019s a lesson to be learned about the need for greater transparency to manage expectations. Would you agree with that?", "9443 MR. GAUVIN: Absolutely. So greater -- now the transparency, there\u2019s some limits to that because the DSAs and the exchanges, some of those are actually technical. So that\u2019s how we actually plan our network.", "9444 THE CHAIRPERSON: Fair enough.", "9445 MR. GAUVIN: But there\u2019s also ---", "9446 THE CHAIRPERSON: But I mean, in terms of how decisions are made and the relevant factors and --", "9447 MR. GAUVIN: Yes.", "9448 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- that they may not be for everywhere, et cetera.", "9449 MR. GAUVIN: Absolutely. And it points towards the importance of coordination. Because if the coordination for the timing of the coordination of the funding was there, it would have alleviated a lot of the overlapping issues and the confusion.", "9450 THE CHAIRPERSON: How do you determine which -- when there are government funding programs, how do you determine which projects to submit to?", "9451 MR. DANIELS: I think what happens is, depending on the nature of the program, we actually look at and decide whether we see a business opportunity there and whether we think we\u2019ll be successful in the business opportunity. ", "9452 So I\u2019m not exactly privy to all the conversations that go on in terms of deciding. It\u2019s generally -- but I can put it this way. When Connecting Canadians was out, we had an extensive examination and determination and decision to bid. We didn\u2019t succeed, for the most part. But we participated extensively in the bidding for Connecting Canadians. So they\u2019re more smaller and individual ones.", "9453 I was just going to ask Paul if he wanted to add anything as to how he makes the determination at Northwestel.", "9454 THE CHAIRPERSON: Perhaps what I\u2019m trying to get at is not so much how you made past decisions, but what kind of information would you need to make informed decisions?", "9455 MR. DANIELS: I -- again, the rules of the road through -- and that\u2019s probably all we would need in -- just in ---", "9456 THE CHAIRPERSON: The ones we referred to earlier?", "9457 MR. DANIELS: Yes, exactly. ", "9458 THE CHAIRPERSON: And you would be advocating the same sort of an approach for the newly announced money the Federal Government has announced, but not announced the details around it?", "9459 MR. DANIELS: Yes and our suggestion is that you could make recommendations to that effect.", "9460 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, thank you. ", "9461 Let me now turn to the area of targets, because that\u2019s part of the way one might fill in the gaps. ", "9462 So is it your view that a 5 in 1 target would meet the expanded needs of Canadians and I\u2019m talking about economic, social, democratic and cultural?", "9463 MR. MALCOLMSON: I\u2019ll start, Mr. Chairman, and then I\u2019ll ask Mr. Gauvin to add.", "9464 It is our view that 5 in 1 is sufficient today to provide Canadians with what they need to participate in the digital economy. ", "9465 There\u2019s evidence on the record that I think shows that what uses people make of broadband are served by 5 in 1 speeds and Phil will talk about those in a minute. ", "9466 Having said that, we all recognize that the need for speed is moving and so that\u2019s why in our proposal we said establish the base level of 5 in 1, but if you\u2019re making subsidy money available there should be an element of future proofing in the network build, so we suggested that successful bidders would have to build out to 10 in 1 capability.", "9467 So yes today is it going to change in the future? Probably, if the past is any indication and I\u2019ll ask Phil to talk about why 5 in 1 works. ", "9468 And sorry the other consideration too was, if we set the bar, the speed bar, very high now we create a larger need, a larger pool of money is needed and so ---", "9469 THE CHAIRPERSON: So ---", "9470 MR. MALCOLMSON: So our goal was really ---", "9471 THE CHAIRPERSON: Not a pragmatic aspect in terms of available resources? ", "9472 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes. How do we get those that aren\u2019t connected today online first. That should be the priority.", "9473 Phil?", "9474 MR. GAUVIN: Sure thing. Absolutely. So the basis for why we recommended the 5 in 1 is really based on the record, what do Canadians need to participate in the digital economy.", "9475 And there\u2019s been some discussion about entertainment and I think that\u2019s a bit of a red herring, because there\u2019s actually videos that people will use and, you know, whether it\u2019s YouTube or watching the news or, you know, actually Skyping with each other and family across the nation.", "9476 So there is a need there, but the point behind the 5 in 1 is you can actually make use of those services with a 5 in 1 connection.", "9477 You can participate in the social conversation. You can watch shows and say this is the person that died yesterday, did you see that or whatever and it\u2019s actually possible to do multi-tasking. ", "9478 So I have a 5 in 1 connection at home and we watched House of Cards on Netflix in HD and we tested out whether we can have a separate HD stream and yes it is possible. ", "9479 Now can we have 8 people in a household watching HD streams over a 5 megs connection? No. It\u2019ll be slightly lower than that. ", "9480 You can still actually watch video. The quality will be lower and usually what happens with streaming services is it\u2019ll have variable bit rates and all that and actually slow down the services. ", "9481 But in terms of participating in the conversation and watching the video and being able to understand what\u2019s there, you can.", "9482 And Skype I know we\u2019ve submitted on the record, in our intervention and also in response to CRTC 1 in the second round, the Skype recommendations. ", "9483 And you can Skype with 5 people with a 4 megs connection and less than 1 up, so in terms of multi-tasking even for video-conferencing that\u2019s possible as well.", "9484 So that\u2019s a basis for why 5 in 1 is necessary and as Rob was saying, if you increase the target to say 10 in 1 or 25/3, suddenly the pool of people that are considered not basic or not served increases. ", "9485 And there\u2019s two aspects to that. There\u2019s, first of all, you\u2019re increasing the size of the problem and who needs to be focused on. ", "9486 And if the pool increases the focus of the carriers will be on those that already have some type of access, but will be easier to fix than those that don\u2019t have access today.", "9487 So if the target becomes 10 in 1, chances are the people that have 5 in 1 today, will be at 10 in 1 before those that don\u2019t have access, because it will be much cheaper to fix those.", "9488 THE CHAIRPERSON: And I take it because you put it in evidence yourselves, that you don\u2019t disagree with the analysis in CRTC Exhibit number 1, I think we produced at the beginning of the hearing; is that correct? ", "9489 MR. GAUVIN: That\u2019s absolutely correct.", "9490 THE CHAIRPERSON: Now, am I mistaken or you\u2019re really at this point just talking about residential individual uses?", "9491 MR. GAUVIN: I am, but for ---", "9492 THE CHAIRPERSON: Wait, so then my question is what is the right target for small business -- small-medium businesses?", "9493 MR. GAUVIN: For small and medium business the target would be similar if not the same. ", "9494 In terms of the needs of a small business, whether it\u2019s payroll or browsing, doing your research, setting up your website for e-commerce, one of the great equalizers is Cloud Services. ", "9495 And by that what I mean is if you\u2019re in a remote community and you have fairly low upload speeds, which is not what we\u2019re recommending. We\u2019re recommending there be up to 1 and -- which is actually beyond what legacy DSL is capable of. ", "9496 But if you have fairly low upload speeds and you want to setup a website you can do that and have it hosted by Amazon Cloud Services or another cloud service, and suddenly your website is available, you know, to the world and hosted somewhere. ", "9497 And in terms of download speeds their requirements are typically fairly lower as well and that actually pans out then actually what the small and medium businesses would buy from us, which Scott could address.", "9498 MR. BARRETT: Yes, certainly as my colleague suggested that a lot of the needs of the smaller businesses, when you\u2019re talking POS transactions and every day transactions that they would -- they would use, five is more than sufficient. ", "9499 We find that 50 percent of our customers that are on, in the small business market, that are on a 5 megs service, actually have options to buy faster service to stay; they\u2019ve chosen not to.", "9500 THE CHAIRPERSON: And your view is that there are cost effective solutions to address the upload issue?", "9501 MR. GAUVIN: Yes. ", "9502 MR. DANIELS: And if we could just jump in, the one other thing to note about, like, the way we\u2019ve approached this program is to look at households as connecting Canadians somewhat.", "9503 That doesn\u2019t mean that businesses don\u2019t get the benefit, because on -- as you\u2019ve heard many businesses, 5 in 1 would be sufficient and in fact most businesses of small size that\u2019s what they\u2019re buying, the smallest package.", "9504 But if you build into a community, and I\u2019m thinking of a rural or a remote community, that you build in the capability of serving all the customers 5 in 1, what ends up happening is that you have the capability because you built the transport that during -- that\u2019s built to handle for peak usage which is in the evening. ", "9505 Businesses don\u2019t peak in the evening, so you may actually be able to, the service provider there, offer a higher speed to a business during the day, for example, when they need it. ", "9506 So it\u2019s not if there\u2019s some community business for whatever reason needs a higher speed you may be able to do that and they will be, if you will, taken along, get the benefit of that community being connected for households at 5 in 1. ", "9507 MR. FLAHERTY: One example of that could be in Dawson City, for example, if you look at the government service that we provide there, it\u2019s like a 30 megs services and we\u2019re looking at making it something much more, yet what we provide to residential customers is a 15 megs service. ", "9508 So being that there are few businesses/government offices there, we can offer a bigger service that uses the daytime capacity, whereas the consumers are largely consuming the evening capacity.", "9509 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And the tourists of course in the businesses. ", "9510 So you, through a variety of action, you\u2019re saying the primary outcome should be 5 in 1? ", "9511 How long should it take? ", "9512 MR. DANIELS: I mean it should all be done by five years, but probably much earlier. Because the way we see it is that the auction could be done -- once the auction is done it\u2019s a couple year build out. ", "9513 So for example under Connecting Canadians the requirement is that you have to build out by 2017. The funding has just been given this year and last year. ", "9514 So even though we\u2019re talking about a five year program, we think that it could be done much earlier, depending on when the actual parameters are established and the auction is run, but once that\u2019s done it\u2019s one to two -- you know, one to two years for build out.", "9515 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Now TELUS stated that they thought that there\u2019d still be pockets of Canadians who will never get access. What's your view?", "9516 MR. DANIELS: I think that there's probably some people who live not in a community for example that might be in an area or people are just outside that will have to rely on different solutions, for example, a satellite solution. And when I say satellite there, that here I am referring to a DTA ---", "9517 THE CHAIRPERSON: The other way.", "9518 MR. DANIELS: --- the other kind of solution. I agree with TELUS for exactly the same reasons that they talked about how it works with voice, but there are probably some areas that some people live in that won't get to, that won't necessarily get service.", "9519 Having said that, again, our focus is trying to get as many communities connected and that frees up further capacity for higher speeds being offered on the satellite solution, the direct-to-home satellite.", "9520 THE CHAIRPERSON: Am I correct in assuming that in densely urban competitive markets, you are actually building out to higher capacity?", "9521 MR. MALCOLMSON: The short answer is yes, where there's a business case to do with Toronto is a prime example.", "9522 As you know, we're building out to gigabit speeds. We have a sort of -- what I would call an internal aspirational target which we've talked about publicly which is we would like to be -- have 90 percent of our footprint served by gigabit speeds over the next 10 years. Obviously in densely populated urban areas, that is where the business case most warrants it. So yes, we are building out to those speeds.", "9523 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Help me understand if 5 and 1 or even 10 and 1 is sufficient, why are you building out so much more?", "9524 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, I think it comes down to really the discussion we've been having throughout the hearing between wants and needs. When we talk about 5 and 1, we're talking about it in the context of what's necessary to participate in the digital economy and the evidence, as Phil says, shows that that can be achieved at speeds of 5 and 1.", "9525 In a competitive marketplace, we constantly want to build the higher speeds to serve customers\u2019 wants. There are customers out there that have a desire for much higher speeds and we would like to serve them. So they're really ---", "9526 THE CHAIRPERSON: Even if those desires are completely irrationable and unreasonable?", "9527 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, I think if our customers are using their hard-earned dollars to purchase our services that they're acting rationally before they make their purchasing decisions.", "9528 THE CHAIRPERSON: So in your recommendations, you said that we should focus on Bands G and H.", "9529 MR. MALCOLMSON: G and H1, correct.", "9530 THE CHAIRPERSON: H1, sorry, yes. That that's scribble I've written down next to my letter here.", "9531 So do you believe that the CRTC has jurisdiction to declare something a basic telecom service at less than a pan-Canadian level? You may have noted the conversation I had with a group earlier last week on this issue.", "9532 MR. DANIELS: So we think that you have the jurisdiction. Let me break this down into two things now that we're getting legal.", "9533 So under 46.5, you can decide what is a basic telecom service and we think you should define broadband as a basic telecom service at 5 and 1.", "9534 That doesn't mean -- we also think you have the jurisdiction to say well the parameters are that for terrestrial builds, we're going to require funding for 10 and 1, which is our proposal to future proofs. So we think you have the jurisdiction to do that.", "9535 But in terms of the definition of what's a basic telecom service, we're proposing that it be 5 and 1 and that's a national definition. But if you look at what you've done in the voice world for example, you've only declared given areas as ones where the basic service objective exists.", "9536 And so we think that from that perspective, you can declare broadband as a basic telecom service at 5 and 1 and then say but we're only going to fund in these particular areas.", "9537 And yes, when we fund, we could fund to a higher speed. So the answer, the short answer is yes. One, you have the jurisdiction. Two, I think the pan-Canadian definition is 5 and 1, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have the jurisdiction to fund a higher build as under our proposal in some communities but not all because we're saying terrestrial at 10 and 1, satellite would stay at 5 and 1 for now.", "9538 MR. GAUVIN: I just want to add a quick point on this. When we say basic, I think if you ask most Canadians what does basic mean, it likely equates to vital and broadband is vital to Canadians. When we ---", "9539 THE CHAIRPERSON: I've heard that.", "9540 MR. GAUVIN: I've heard that too. When we say basic, basic appear -- basic telecommunication service appears three times in the Act in the definition of TSP in section 33 and 46.5, and it's all about setting a fund to fund basic telecom services and it's a means to an end and what should we fund.", "9541 So when we say is it basic in G and H1, we're not saying it's not important to Canadians everywhere. We're just saying let's fund here so that we can coordinate and ---", "9542 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So you're saying it's a threshold question but it doesn\u2019t define all the outcomes, right?", "9543 MR. GAUVIN: Exactly.", "9544 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. You mentioned the fact that, of course, market forces have worked quite well for many Canadians in terms of availability and quality. And in certain centres, you know, anybody looking at the amount of money being spent on advertising of services and competition is quite active. But I'm wondering if you've given some thought to managing expectations.", "9545 We just talked about that 5 and 1 probably meets most but ISP providers are doing a lot of competition saying we're faster, we're faster with capacitor.", "9546 Doesn't that create or potentially create an expectation in the broader population that that's what they need and want?", "9547 In other words, your advertising is bouncing back at you because even though you may not be able to deliver, either your or some other ISP in that particular area, you've created this notion that speed is exactly what one wants.", "9548 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, I think we advertise numerous service parameters and speed is certainly one of them and the competitive marketplace is driving towards higher and higher speeds in competitive markets and that's -- you know, I don\u2019t view that as ---", "9549 THE CHAIRPERSON: I can understand why you don\u2019t want to do an advertising campaign saying you really don\u2019t need to pay us more for the speed because you really don\u2019t need it. That's not a winning campaign.", "9550 Put that aside, there is a reality here that -- the Australian government had the same problem in the early days of their broadband. Everybody wanted fibre. They didn't know what it was but they certainly knew that that's what they wanted. And in fact, some of them did not need that but there was the capabilities that even copper loops could do a long way in certain areas in Australia.", "9551 It's the same thing, isn\u2019t it?", "9552 MR. MALCOLMSON: Fair comment. I think we're -- I guess we perhaps have confidence that our customers will choose the packages they want. We offer a range of speeds and explain exactly to the customer what the speeds are, what the service features are, what the pricing is. So the customers are well informed about what they want to purchase and they're able to purchase a package that suits their needs.", "9553 I think some of my colleagues have additional comments. Phil?", "9554 MR. GAUVIN: Yeah. I don\u2019t think you can look at any competitive market and see the competitors say, \u201cLet me offer you only what you need and only what you need, just a basic level service\u201d. So in terms of competition, it's we'll offer you the best service and the speeds are increasing.", "9555 What we're talking about today is what's the basic level service for Canadians participating in the digital economy? The evidence on the record is 5 and 1 is likely enough and we're actually advocating building 10 and 1 where 5 and 1 is not available.", "9556 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019ll get back later to the issue of customers being well informed and what you do about that. I just want to continue in the order I've got the questions right now.", "9557 Are there other non-speed standards that you think we should be looking at either from a normative perspective or from an aspirational perspective? I'm thinking here of jitter, latency, repair times.", "9558 MR. GAUVIN: Yes to both. So for the aspirational perspective, we put on the record 25/1 and after some discussion reviewing the record, we agree that we could probably live with ---", "9559 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, I'm talking about non-speed issues.", "9560 MR. GAUVIN: So for the non-speed issues on the jitter and the latency, our view is that if you want to set standards, you should likely set them based on services that should be supported instead of actual set latency requirements or set jitter requirements. ", "9561 Reason being, for example, we heard someone on the record that they had trouble with their VPN on satellite. And we know that in our satellite communities VPN can work. So you could, you know, based on that information on the record set a latency requirement specifically to exclude satellite under the thought that that will resolve the VPN issue. But in actuality, you can develop the technology or make it work on satellite.", "9562 So our view is that if you set the standards for latency or jitter really say, you know, if you want VOiP to be supported spell that out. That VOiP should be supported, streaming services should be supported, and VPN should be supported. ", "9563 THE CHAIRPERSON: So defining it by actual capability in notions that you can get your head around, most Canadians can get their head around, rather than technical parameters that some people might understand but probably are well over my head?", "9564 MR. GAUVIN: Exactly. And enabling innovation of the service level to make sure that those services can work.", "9565 MR. DANIELS: And I think that addresses or could help to address, not perfectly solve, your previous question regarding expectations. ", "9566 THE CHAIRPERSON: I hope people are thinking about that more broadly about managing expectations because I think there is an issue we have when we are out there constantly talking about this great new thing and it can\u2019t be everywhere.", "9567 Speaking of non -- didn\u2019t even speak about the non-speed standards. Are they part of existing government programming funding?", "9568 MR. MALCOLMSON: In terms of Connecting Canadians, I think the -- and I stand to be corrected -- in certain communities there is a price standard, but I don\u2019t believe there are other standards. But I stand to be corrected.", "9569 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you want to take an undertaking just to come back to us if there is a -- so we understand if there is -- if there is none that\u2019s fine. And if you have any knowledge. I mean, your answer was based on the federal program but I was wondering if you knew of any provincial programs that also had concerns in that regard? ", "9570 And I appreciate you haven\u2019t done a survey of every government program that has existed but to the extent you know any.", "9571 ", "UNDERTAKING", "9572 MR. MALCOLMSON: If I could just clarify one point in the discussion you were having around standards. Our view is fine to articulate standards but we wouldn\u2019t endorse mandated regulation of standards. We think the competitive marketplace does just fine in terms of achieving customers\u2019 needs and accomplish -- meeting standards. So I just wanted to be clear for the record.", "9573 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, it is clear for the record. But I had taken that as a given in light of your other positions.", "9574 You\u2019ve said that, you know, one of the factors that you think we should consider is technological neutrality. And I take your point with respect to satellites. That\u2019s somewhat different.", "9575 But you may have heard some evidence that some Canadians want mobile broadband solutions. How realistic is that in the context of what we\u2019re talking about? And that\u2019s achieving the targets that we were talking about.", "9576 MR. DANIELS: Well, there\u2019s two-fold to answer that. So the first thing, and what you heard a number of people said hey, it would be great if you had -- if you preferred, for example, a wireless or an LTE solution because it would have the benefit of also bringing along the mobility. And I see merit in that and I\u2019m going to come back to that in a second, but conceptually but not in terms of our proposal.", "9577 Where I say the fact that probably most people wouldn\u2019t understand is that the network use it\u2019s not just a question of putting up a tower and having the facilities, the backhauls of the tower. Our network, our mobile network, is built to handle capacity of what people actually use the mobile network for based on the use and the pricing and so on.", "9578 And from your own Commission\u2019s Monitoring Report, the CMR, you say that Canadians with smartphones use about a little bit below a gig on average a month in terms of on the smartphone from a data perspective. Whereas, if you go over to the wireline service it\u2019s 66.5 gigabits a month. That means we\u2019re building a network on the wireline that\u2019s not the same as wireless in terms of being able to handle capacity.", "9579 And our direct experience in this is actually the deferral account situation where we proposed and built out for the deferral account broadband to 108 communities in Ontario and Quebec to bring them broadband at speeds of 5 and 1. But we spent, as you know, over $300 million on this. And that wasn\u2019t just about building towers to places that didn\u2019t have towers; there was some of that. ", "9580 But it was also building more towers to be able to handle the greater volumes of demand to building more robust in terms of backbone networks to handle the greater use that was expected to have because ultimately the product we launch is one that matched terrestrial rates so we were expecting greater use.", "9581 Now, in that situation, we were the ones who were advocating to you -- I don\u2019t mean you specifically but to the CRTC -- that we should be allowed to use a wireless solution because it has the benefit that will also be able to bring mobile to areas. So there is -- so I do see merit in that area.", "9582 But the problem is if we start preferring technologies then we\u2019re going to end up with a much higher cost as we design our network. You\u2019re going to give advantage to wireless carriers, which maybe I shouldn\u2019t be complaining about but, you know, you\u2019re -- if the goal, and we think the goal should be to bring broadband of 5 and 1 to all Canadian households, then we want to do that effectively and the most efficiently. And if you start having parameters where you prefer one technology to another it\u2019s going to take the cost up and take players out of the market and distort the market, which we don\u2019t think is the right way to go.", "9583 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. Let me go back to Exhibit number 1, CRTC Exhibit number 1. And you\u2019ve made the point again a little while ago about saying that entertainment uses are not necessary. I think you said that at paragraph 9 of your written argument.", "9584 Yet, we\u2019ve heard arguments so far that the CRTC shouldn\u2019t get involved in normative evaluations of what media choices are made through broadband connectivity. So how do you square those two principles? MR. DANIELS: So I think the way we\u2019re squaring the principles is -- to be honest, is that we\u2019ve had a slight change in the way we -- you haven\u2019t -- when we drafted that it was a concern that people were taking Netflix as the purpose and so on. ", "9585 We\u2019ve listened over the course of this proceeding and in discussions in coming here. We\u2019ve basically proposed 5 and 1 because it allows people to participate in digital economy. When Phil gave his answer before, Phil gave an answer which specifically referred to that 5 and 1 allows people to use Netflix and so on. So but he also pointed out that videos could be for educational purposes or knowing what\u2019s going on. ", "9586 So we accept that and it\u2019s why we haven\u2019t really focused to say entertainment. What we will say -- but entertainment should be excluded, we say is that 5 and 1 allows people, whether if entertainment is your goal or if it\u2019s purposes in goal, you\u2019re going to be able to achieve it with a true 5 and 1 offer.", "9587 THE CHAIRPERSON: You were on the button before your colleague spoke. I didn\u2019t know if you wanted to add something.", "9588 MR. GAUVIN: Well, I agree. But at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter. And I heard last week Canadians saying if you\u2019re lonely and Netflix or entertainment might be your only source of human contact, so I think we have to be open to that.", "9589 And the point with regards to the 5 and 1 is it doesn\u2019t matter because you can have access and Netflix. I watch Netflix; I have a 5 and 1 connection. Over Easter I had family over and we Skyped with my brother in the States while my -- without going into my family history -- my little sister was watching little YouTube clips, children\u2019s YouTube clips at the same time. And it worked. So multi-tasking and video is possible on a 5 and 1 connection.", "9590 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t taken the opportunity to promote Crave as potential uses.", "9591 MR. GAUVIN: And Crave. I\u2019ve actually watched Orphan Black on Crave as well.", "9592 MR. MALCOLMSON: He should have, Mr. Chairman. ", "9593 THE CHAIRPERSON: What would you say to those that maybe your position of limiting the 5 and 1 -- and we see it from the chart that it does have a consequence in terms of what kinds of videos one can stream -- that it may be informed more by your presence in media assets?", "9594 MR. GAUVIN: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question.", "9595 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, we know that some of the higher end streaming services could not be necessarily, even from our chart, be used on a 5 and 1 service, and some may suggest -- I'm not saying I am, but some may suggest that that is informed by your desire to protect your media assets.", "9596 MR. GAUVIN: So now I understand that really, it's about whether or not ultra HD is a basic need. And for ultra HD, I totally acknowledge ultra HD wouldn't work on a five and one connection. Ultra HD, you also need a 4K TV or you know, a device that can actually support the 4K connection. ", "9597 So in our view, HD is more than enough so you know, speaking again -- it's purely anecdotal, it's my experience -- but on a TV, you know, a flat-screen TV, watching \"House of Cards\" or watching \"Orphan Black\", actually works and it's, you know, my eyes aren't bleeding. It's actually a very nice image. ", "9598 MR. MALCOLMSON: Mr. Chairman, I can tell you that protecting our media business was the furthest thing from our minds when we designed our proposal. It's really based on what's necessary to participate in a digital economy and how do we roll it out to those Canadians that don\u2019t have it and how do we do it quickly? ", "9599 THE CHAIRPERSON: Fair enough. I just wanted you to have a chance to say that. ", "9600 I notice -- so I notice that your aspirational target does provide for a higher upload speed. I was wondering why that was shaping your thinking? ", "9601 MR. GAUVIN: Yeah, so we had concerns with regards to costs and deploying higher upload speeds, but as time went on, we looked into it more. If you can support 25 megs down, chances are you can support 3 megs up. So we would be comfortable as an aspirational speed with 25-3. ", "9602 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. And your aspirational target, do you have a timeframe? ", "9603 MR. GAUVIN: So the difference between aspirational and basic -- basic is what we think Canadians need and potentially should be funded through subsidies. Aspirational is about how we compare ourselves with the world, how we see where Canada should be generally, so it's no longer about needs. ", "9604 So I think it would -- a five-year target for 25-3 is reasonable, but really, you know, you can set whatever you deem is reasonable and achievable. And in terms of setting achievable and reasonable goals, if you look at Appendix 2 of our submission, you can see how various countries actually did that, because 25-3, for example, for satellite communities, might not be reasonable. ", "9605 I'm not -- I don't know. I mean, that's something to look into, but one way to do it would be to say, you know, it could be 80 percent at 25-3, 20 percent or 15 percent at 50 and whatever, and a certain percentage at a lower target for satellite. ", "9606 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, well, I did have a question precisely on that, because when you discuss this in your documents, you do point to the Australian aspirational need, which is a little bit more fine tuned, because I think they make a distinction that it's 12 in rural areas, 25 everywhere else, and 50 for 90 percent of the fixed lines.", "9607 Now, I'm not saying that those are the right speeds. I'm not saying either that those are the right bundles, but I was wondering why you haven't proposed an aspirational target that actually reflects, perhaps, some of the diversity of the country, its geography, its current state? ", "9608 MR. GAUVIN: We could have. We potentially should have. We can take an undertaking to do that, in terms of what we think is (inaudible).", "9609 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'd appreciate it. ", "9610 ", "UNDERTAKING", "9611 It goes back to the theme of managing expectations, because I do think, if I've read correctly, your view is that in satellite-served communities, using that, that selling 25 may not be the best thing, in terms of managing expectations. Would you agree with that? ", "9612 MR. GAUVIN: Based on technology today, although as we've heard on the record, that might change in three years, so I don't know. We'll see it if we get there. ", "9613 THE CHAIRPERSON: Exactly, and we don\u2019t have the budgets for time travel. ", "9614 Now, when you -- in your written submissions -- and maybe I misunderstand your position; perhaps it's evolved, but you seem to be saying that the five-one target is the correct standards to define what served, underserved, unserved areas are, and then that opens up to funding. ", "9615 But you seem to link it to what the Connecting Canadians program defined, but it was my understanding that the Connecting Canadians programs was, in part, informed what the CRTC had done in the previous proceeding. ", "9616 So we end up going into a loop of setting a standard based on somebody else's program, rather than looking at the evidence before us. Or maybe I misunderstood what you were arguing there.", "9617 MR. GAUVIN: Unless I'm misunderstanding the question, I think the five and one is based on the record, is based on what's necessary to participate in the digital economy.", "9618 THE CHAIRPERSON: That would be your position now, because my reading of your original position was that's what Connecting Canadians set, and therefore, that should be the right target. ", "9619 MR. GAUVIN: Well, we also said that based -- we had the chart with Exhibit 1 in our submission as well, and we said, \"This is what's needed to participate in the digital economy.\"", "9620 In terms of Connecting Canadians, the learnings that we can get from that program is, for example, the mapping exercise, which we still recommend that should be done, because that's actually a heavy-lifting undertaking, to determine where services are actually available at five and one. ", "9621 And I don't know, what's the chicken and the egg, you know? Now the CRTC just did it, maybe Connecting Canadians will update it or whatever. ", "9622 But in terms of coordination, it would be very useful if that map was updated and we kept the same map so that we're all speaking the same language nationally. ", "9623 THE CHAIRPERSON: That's fine. I think I could guess what your answer will be, but for the record, and having read what your submission is, some have suggested that a target should involve the question of pricing and I guess implicitly, capacity, because those tend to go hand in hand. ", "9624 Do you think that's a good idea? ", "9625 MR. GAUVIN: Oh well, we've said in our proposal that whoever wins an auction should offer services at comparable rates to other areas, so in terms of pricing and capacity, those rates and terms should be comparable to whatever's available in that territory or province. ", "9626 THE CHAIRPERSOIN: But not beyond those particular territories? ", "9627 MR. MALCOLMSON: That's correct. If you're the beneficiary of subsidy, in return you commit to provide comparable pricing terms. ", "9628 THE CHAIRPERSON: You may have seen Exhibit 4 that we put in yesterday, and it just gets to the point about comparable rates. And I know it's a dated document, since it was based in 2014. So in your proposal that the funding model should be based on comparable rates, explain to me what a comparable rate might look like, in light of the various variations right across the country. ", "9629 MR. DANIELS: So under our proposal, it would be within the same territory or province, and the idea and the thinking behind it is in order to get the maximum benefit, you want ISPs to be bidding. What makes sense for an ISP to bid is if I can add that community to my existing suite of services that I'm offering. ", "9630 So if we had five communities in Ontario that we were bidding for, our requirement would be to match the five in one, our price for our Fibe 5 service, which I'll -- can get Scott to tell you in a minute, in terms of what we -- that would be the price that we would have to match. ", "9631 The reason that we're -- that logic behind it is, if we start having different parameters or different prices or set prices or something like that, Bell could look at it, for example, and say, \"It's not big enough to justify creating a whole new price point, having new requirements, and so on.\" ", "9632 What we're trying to do, and suggest in our proposal here, is that the best way is to have people match what they're already doing to add a community to their suite of services. And that's how Connecting Canadians works generally. ", "9633 THE CHAIRPERSON: But one has to clearly define what's comparable; do you agree with that?", "9634 MR. DANIELS: Well, I think what we -- you can give some parameters around how you would interpret comparable, from our perspective, you know? There's probably a little bit of flexibility, but the real truth is, for a large provider like us, the way we would (inaudible) would be to put that into the existing suite, so it would have to be comparable to something we offer at five and one for similar technology. ", "9635 THE CHAIRPERSON: In a similar region or in the same region? ", "9636 MR. DANIELS: We actually propose province or territory, so when I say \"territory\" I mean the Territories in the north, not --- ", "9637 THE CHAIRPERSON: (Inaudible). ", "9638 MR. DANIELS: Not a (inaudible), yeah, exactly. ", "9639 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Let me turn now to other potential gaps. In one of your key findings, I think it was 1-C you said that skilled labour in remote areas might be a greater barrier to ICT adoption than the lack of high speed bandwidth. Again, keeping in mind that it\u2019s not necessarily the CRTC that will find all the solutions and fund all the solutions, how do you think Canada should address and fill that gap?", "9640 MR. GAUVIN: If you look at our exhibit with the recommendations, which I\u2019m sure you have over lunch, we recommend promoting digital literacy and that falls into that. We actually considered putting in a bullet about promoting skilled labour and education and all that. ", "9641 And as an example ---", "9642 THE CHAIRPERSON: So your term \u201cdigital literacy\u201d would include skilled labour?", "9643 MR. GAUVIN: Yes.", "9644 THE CHAIRPERSON: Perhaps a bit broader than I would have thought it should.", "9645 MR. GAUVIN: Absolutely.", "9646 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "9647 MR. GAUVIN: Absolutely. And to give an example, we deploy a lot of fiber. There is actually not enough technicians skilled in fiber deployment to meet our needs and we actually have to train them. There\u2019s a shortage of ICT employees in Canada and we\u2019ve, in the past -- so in the documents leading up to the digital Canada 150 and still today, I guess, we\u2019re recommending that there be programs to encourage skilled labour. And that\u2019s part of digital literacy.", "9648 So there\u2019s on the technical side and there\u2019s also on the demand side promoting literacy and promoting adoption of technologies with -- not just with youth, which is, of course, is important, but also with senior citizens and various segments of the population.", "9649 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you\u2019re thinking of programs offered by social departments to encourage education, whether federally or provincially, to develop skilled workers, trades, that sort of thing?", "9650 MR. GAUVIN: Yes. And it\u2019s a joint effort. So like Telus said, we\u2019re also members of MediaSmarts and promoting digital literacy in our own little way, but government definitely has a role as well.", "9651 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "9652 It\u2019s strange, I always referred to digital literacy in a much more narrow way and not to include digital skills that technicians may need. I certainly don\u2019t think I need those skills, but I still want to be digitally literate to be able to interact with devices. But perhaps others have different definitions.", "9653 What\u2019s your most -- would it be possible -- maybe this is a -- because I did note that our chart is a little old. Would it be possible for you to provide us with the most affordable broadband internet service package you currently have in each province or territory?", "9654 MR. MALCOLMSON: We could file those as an undertaking.", "9655 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "9656 ", "UNDERTAKING", "9657 THE CHAIRPERSON: And would those normally be advertised and clearly available on your website or websites, I guess?", "9658 MR. MALCOLMSON: I\u2019ll ask Scott, who is our pricing guru to take you through how we advertise different packages.", "9659 MR. BARRETT: Certainly. We use our website as one of our many marketing vehicles to advertise all the packages that are available. In the case of our website, we don\u2019t necessarily advertise all the packages up front. It\u2019s really geared to the most popular packages that we feel our customers are taking today. And we use other methods like direct mail to target specific offers for various individuals that have different packages that would be available to them as well.", "9660 THE CHAIRPERSON: So would you be similar to Telus that it may be not actively advertised on websites or through other marketing but if you ask you would get the answer?", "9661 MR. BARRETT: Absolutely. If you were to pick up the phone and talk to one of our agents, you would give them your address or your phone number, in our case, and they would be able to offer the full suite of services that we would offer to you today.", "9662 THE CHAIRPERSON: But they\u2019re not actively offered by your CSRs unless only if asked?", "9663 MR. BARRETT: Well, I assume that if the customer is calling and inquiring about services, we will make available to them the options that they have available.", "9664 THE CHAIRPERSON: You may have been struck by some representative from Acorn and Vice-Chair Menzies asked some of them about what they were paying currently. Some of us were struck by what some of them were paying because it seemed to us that there were less costly options probably available. And I was wondering if you felt that you had any responsibility, not individually, not as a company, but as service providers to help them understand that in light of their circumstances that there may be less expensive options?", "9665 MR. GAUVIN: I think we\u2019ve heard from ---", "9666 THE SECRETARY: I\u2019m sorry. Can you please speak closer to your mic? You can ---", "9667 MR. GAUVIN: Absolutely. Sorry.", "9668 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "9669 MR. GAUVIN: I just keep hitting it so I try to move it.", "9670 So I think we\u2019ve heard from Mr. Lawford and the AAC and also from Acorn that there is no one size fits all solution. So some of them were paying for bigger plans and likely have bigger needs than other people, you know, that might not just do email and web browsing and don\u2019t need very big capacity plans. So the fact that a more affordable plan is available might not actually meet their needs.", "9671 But we\u2019ve also heard from those Canadians that some of them are living off of $553 a month. Someone mentioned that in Vancouver the subsidies available are $550, you know, around $600 if you have a child, and $900 with a disability. So the issue isn\u2019t affordability of the services, it\u2019s a poverty issue. ", "9672 So our view, like is in our recommendation, it\u2019s a government issue. And the recommendation would be for the governments to actually start considering internet as an essential service.", "9673 THE CHAIRPERSON: I appreciate that\u2019s your perspective in the longer term, but even helping somebody go from a plan that could actually be $10 less, for somebody in those brackets, to do that right away would make a huge difference.", "9674 MR. MALCOLMSON: As Scott said, if a customer who has an existing plan does call in and is in need of a package that better suits their needs, those packages are available. ", "9675 And I should also say, when I do look at your Exhibit 4, it does really show a range of pricing in various markets that, you know, the lowest price seems to be in the 24.95 range. So there are pricing options out there in the competitive marketplace that, you know, that people can avail themselves of. People who live in poverty, obviously anything becomes unaffordable and that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying.", "9676 So we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of the price of the packages, it\u2019s a question of the purchasing power of the customer who needs basic internet as a necessity. And again, that -- when we put those two together, that seems to be best suited for a government program.", "9677 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. But the benefit of that exhibit is that it may actually, in an ancillary way, provide information out there to people that are not optimizing the cost of their service right now.", "9678 MR. MALCOLMSON: It does.", "9679 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you provide -- so are there online tools, for instance, to help subscribers or potential subscribers to best manage their needs?", "9680 MR. MALCOLMSON: We do. And I\u2019ll ask Scott to walk you through those.", "9681 MR. BARRETT: Yes, we do. In the support section of our webpage we have several different tools, for example, that would offer our customer ability to, based on examples, estimate the bandwidth that they would require in a month and help them in selecting appropriate package.", "9682 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you -- one of the issues before us is some people have raised the issue, and I just wanted your perspective on it, that contracts, internet service contracts may not be as clear as -- for those individuals are arguing it, they should be. I was wondering whether you track complaints or negative comments about your contracts.", "9683 MR. MALCOLMSON: We would provide you with an undertaking on that.", "9684 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Fair enough.", "9685 ", "UNDERTAKING", "9686 THE CHAIRPERSON: And if you could, if you do, in fact, do that, provide us what the top three concerns or negative comments you have with respect to those complaints. If you\u2019re tracking them, you should have metrics around it.", "9687 MR. MALCOLMSON: Top three?", "9688 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, were you providing me every complaint? Like if one person complains about one thing, do you really want to dig around for all that?", "9689 MR. MALCOLMSON: We will provide you with an undertaking.", "9690 ", "UNDERTAKING", "9691 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. ", "9692 MR. GAUVIN: I just want to have some clarification. Is this with regards to understandability of the contracts or terms and conditions generally?", "9693 THE CHAIRPERSON: I think, since you\u2019ve asked, both.", "9694 MR. GAUVIN: Okay. ", "9695 THE CHAIRPERSON: We\u2019ve heard from -- well, we haven\u2019t heard from Rogers directly but we saw in the media that Rogers is offering a low-cost option in certain circumstances. And TELUS has another initiative but it also meets some social responsibility matters. And I was wondering if you have anything similar, or are you planning to?", "9696 MR. MALCOLMSON: We actually do have what\u2019s known as our \u201ccommunity hub program\u201d which we announced when we announced the gigabit fiber build in Toronto last year.", "9697 And what that program does is, in cooperation with the United Way, it provides gigabit service to the United Way\u2019s 50 Toronto-area community hubs which are located in low-income neighbourhoods, neighbourhoods like Jane and Finch, mid Scarborough. ", "9698 And the idea behind the program is, as the name indicates, is to provide a hub where people can go who may not have access to higher speed products. So they can go to the community hub; they can use the service -- it\u2019s offered at no charge -- and it\u2019s available in areas where it\u2019s needed. So that is an initiative that we launched last year.", "9699 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So it would be presumable in a community centre; is that -- these community hubs are somewhere (inaudible).", "9700 MR. MALCOLMSON: The United Way has different community hubs.", "9701 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, right.", "9702 MR. MALCOLMSON: Some of which are community centers, some of which I don\u2019t think we would describe them as a community centre.", "9703 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "9704 MR. MALCOLMSON: But they\u2019re community gathering spots.", "9705 THE CHAIRPERSON: And how many are there did you say?", "9706 MR. MALCOLMSON: There are 50.", "9707 THE CHAIRPERSON: Fifty (50).", "9708 And it is the United Way that ends up having to manage access, and time, and all those kinds of issues presumably; you just provide the facility?", "9709 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes, they\u2019re the operator of the hub. We would provide technical support.", "9710 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Any other support or just technical support? There\u2019s no digital literacy type support in the way I think of digital literacy?", "9711 MR. MALCOLMSON: Well, we participate in digital literacy programs, as you know, so ---", "9712 THE CHAIRPERSON: But I\u2019m thinking specifically in those hubs. Because it\u2019s not just a question of getting access, it\u2019s also a question of understanding the technology. ", "9713 MR. MALCOLMSON: I\u2019m not aware that there\u2019s a direct linkage.", "9714 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. ", "9715 This is a question that I should have asked. It slipped out of order. It goes back to the target discussion. You point out in your documents that 92 percent of Canadians have access -- and these are 2013 numbers -- have access to 5 megabits broadband from two or more platforms. The difference between 92 percent and 100 arguably is a gap if one is trying to support competition and market forces. ", "9716 Is it something we should be concerned about in the broader context? Not necessarily creating a regulatory norm but an objective to ensure that if indeed -- and I think this is your philosophy -- that we should rely on market forces to the extent possible. That we should actually be concerned about ensuring alternative platforms -- or not platforms but alternate providers? ", "9717 MR. DANIELS: We of course support the notion that you should encourage a competitive marketplace and to rely on the marketplace as much as possible. ", "9718 But our focus in terms of when we were talking about roles for the CRTC from a funding perspective, we\u2019re very much saying that under 46.5 when you\u2019re funding basic telecom service your goal is not to bring -- worry about bringing alternative competitors. ", "9719 And that\u2019s why under our proposal, as another criteria which I didn\u2019t mention before, what we didn\u2019t include, was that wholesale obligations, for example. So we don\u2019t think that the winner of any bid should have a wholesale obligation. ", "9720 We don\u2019t believe in the portability of the fund because ultimately we think it\u2019s about under -- from the perspective of when you\u2019re designing a contribution fund or whatever broadband fund that the most important goal is to bring service to those Canadians who don\u2019t have it.", "9721 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "9722 MR. DANIELS: And ---", "9723 THE CHAIRPERSON: My question was more in terms of a broad blueprint or strategy.", "9724 MR. DANIELS: Well, and therefore I\u2019d say that outside of that -- that\u2019s where I was just coming -- I wanted to be clear before I went in to say outside of that.", "9725 THE CHAIRPERSON: I know because your speaking points have -- make sure if the Chair hasn\u2019t asked this question you slip it is as an answer to something else.", "9726 MR. DANIELS: Well, I was worried about being misinterpreted and saying we support the notion.", "9727 THE CHAIRPERSON: Of course.", "9728 MR. DANIELS: Like, so I\u2019d agree with your notion as long as it\u2019s facilities-based competition.", "9729 MR. MALCOLMSON: Sorry, Mr. Chairman, if I think I understood your question was should you be worried about encouraging a further proliferation of ISP competition amongst different ---", "9730 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, proliferation seems to sound so negative. I think I\u2019m thinking of extending more than one service provider as a good thing to most places because we want to rely on market forces. And from what I understand your calculation it\u2019s 92 percent -- 2012 numbers, I think, or \u201913 -- and therefore, perhaps as a strategy more broadly, not a regulatory strategy, that we should be trying to make sure to the extent possible that instead of having an 92 -- or an 8 percent gap that we reduce that over time.", "9731 MR. MALCOLMSON: Fair enough. And I would just -- if we were doing a survey of the landscape I think it\u2019s fair to point out that today there are 525 ISPs operating across the country with a mixture of facilities based in reseller, so it is a very ---", "9732 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "9733 MR. MALCOLMSON: --- competitive market.", "9734 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. But they\u2019re not always evenly distributed.", "9735 MR. MALCOLMSON: Correct. ", "9736 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019ll now turn to some issues that fall under the disability category.", "9763 With respect to VRS implementation, there seems to be a little bit of nervousness to make sure that the providers will be ready for that. ", "9764 And I know, Mr. Daniels, you\u2019ve been very active in this front and we thank you for that. I was wondering how your group of companies is getting ready for that implementation? ", "9765 MR. DANIELS: So, before I answer, and forgive me for giving this caveat, you\u2019ve heard the same from another director who appeared before, we call ourselves -- I sit on the board, as you know ---", "9766 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. ", "9767 MR. DANIELS: --- for the CAB and that all of us have promised that we are going to say that before we speak, that I am speaking as a director of -- not -- I am a director of CAB, but I am answering now in my role as a representative of Bell, not the CAB, and I won\u2019t use any CAB confidential information. ", "9768 Okay. Caveat and legal out of the way. ", "9769 To answer your question, so the way VRS works for the most part, there\u2019s nothing from the TSPs to do in terms of getting ready with the exception, I\u2019m going to come back to the very issue you were just actually asking about, which is the wireless plan. ", "9770 And the reason why I say that is because VRS is funded nationally. It\u2019s going to be set up in the way that the TSP just provides a broadband access service and it\u2019s a broadband access service that will work on a 5 and 1 service and even less. ", "9771 So VRS has existed in the States for a number of years at speeds well below 5 and 1. U.S., they -- in interrogatory to the CAB, they came back and said that it could work on speeds, but for video release service to work, it would need something less than 1, although high-definition could be as high as 1.3. ", "9772 So from a network perspective, an individual customer, all they do is they order broadband from us. We\u2019re blind to that. We don\u2019t fund it directly, know that that customer is using that service. ", "9773 The only exception I\u2019d say is that there\u2019s an expectation that VRS will be -- will allow -- will increase the data usage on wireless handsets, which you heard about. And that\u2019s specifically why we are coming up with a program to have a deaf and hard of -- to address for deaf and hard of hearings who use VRS, not that it would be limited to low -- to use of VRS, but that we\u2019ve come out with a special pricing for deaf and hard of hearings in the expectation. ", "9774 So outside of that, generally there\u2019s nothing more that needs to be done. Specifically, though, there is -- there\u2019s some question about how VRS will work with a satellite. ", "9775 And so we volunteered, talked with Paul and reached out to the CAB proactively and said, why don\u2019t, you know, why don\u2019t we test? So we bought for it to be the test bed for VRS in the satellite community to see how that works as well. ", "9776 So outside of that, generally, no, there\u2019s, you know, ISPs don\u2019t have to do anything. ", "9777 THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. And from a -- and the recommended speeds that you\u2019ve put forward, particularly with respect to upload, would they meet the VRS user requirements to provide a high-quality experience? ", "9778 MR. DANIELS: So here again I\u2019m just quoting from the CAB interlocutory U.S. and that -- and the answer they came back, they said that there\u2019s an appropriate quality of 737 kilobits. So that\u2019s both ways because it\u2019s a dual conversation, but a high quality would be 1.3 megabytes. ", "9779 So our proposal of course is for 5 and 1. And that\u2019s not 1.3, but on the other hand, hopefully it would be -- we certainly -- VRS will work with a 5 and 1. And, in addition, point out that it\u2019s -- VRS has existed for years in the States at speeds that are a lot less than 5 and 1. ", "9780 THE CHAIRMAN: Thank you. A basket of other issues. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a theme to these, so they\u2019re just a little bit everywhere. So there are other matters under my heading here. ", "9781 MR. MALCOLMSON: Mr. Chairman, can I, just before we move away from accessibility, can I ask your indulgence? We\u2019ve -- I just -- I would like Myl\u00e8ne to talk about the efforts we\u2019ve been making lately with deaf and hard of hearing organizations to assist members of that community with customer service. It won\u2019t take long, but I think it\u2019s --- ", "9782 THE CHAIRMAN: Absolutely. Because they\u2019re listening so it\u2019s -- and following the hearing, so it\u2019s important to make sure that they -- that community -- accessibility community gets full information about your efforts. ", "9783 MR. MALCOLMSON: Thank you. ", "9822 MR. DANIELS: Mr. Chairman, I ---", "9823 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes? ", "9824 MR. DANIELS: And I just -- I can't help but say -- and we have a tactile phone that we just launched just at the end of February for blind people. We have two different types, one that's entirely tactile for exactly that market, to serve that. ", "9825 So for the previous intervenor, we have a phone to sell you if you're ready to for to have a phone. ", "9826 THE CHAIRPERSON: If it was any other clientele, I would have asked for a fee for the advertisement. ", "9827 So I have a series of questions on other matters before -- I think we'll take a break and then I'm sure my colleagues will have some questions, but it's a series of questions, so we're not quite done. ", "9828 The first one relates to your proposed reallocation of the voice subsidy from the current National Contribution Fund towards broadband. Is there understanding -- could you explain me how much or in what circumstances your companies currently benefit from the voice subsidy? ", "9829 MR. DANIELS: So specifically, in Bands E and F, we receive $11.5 million annually, and in Bands G and H-1, we receive $14 million. That's 3.8 in Band G and the rest in H-1, which is NorthwesTel territory. ", "9830 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And I can't help but be concerned under your proposal, and maybe if you can explain it to me better, because what you're saying is, we'd remove that subsidy, but over time, prices would be allowed to go up in steps, and that that pool of money could be used to extend broadband as you've proposed it. ", "9831 I can't help but be worried that there may be customers that will see their voice costs go up without the arrival of better broadband. ", "9832 MR. DANIELS: Well, our starting proposition is twofold. One is that just looking at voice itself, no one should receive a subsidy who could afford basically like, whatever a just and reasonable rate is. And we're saying that we think a highest approved rate in the country that you have approved in one area, which is $37.29, should apply elsewhere before anyone receives a subsidy. ", "9833 So that -- but we -- our three-year step is because we realize that there is issues about raising and the transition and it's consistent with what has happened elsewhere. ", "9834 But -- so from a consumer perspective, we're looking at it and saying that we think that $37.29 is a just and reasonable rate, and that there's no need to subsidize generally an area unless people are being charged that rate for home phone service. ", "9835 It's not connected directly to whether that person -- some of those people who are receiving those subsidies are -- they have broadband; many of those people have broadband today and have broadband that exceeds five and one and so it's not a direct relation from that consumer, oh, we're increasing your bill; it's a question of should there be a subsidy? ", "9836 Furthermore, as you know from our proposition, our proposal, we don\u2019t think any subsidy is required in Bands E and F any more, and so that's why we're suggesting that money should be removed and redirected to a place where it is required, which is Bands G and H-1, is our proposal, but nonetheless, in any event, for broadband.", "9837 THE CHAIRPERSON: I wasn\u2019t suggesting there's a one-to-one relationship, but there is a possibility that somebody would be facing higher voice prices over three years but not necessarily whether through the -- not in your proposal, but through other mechanisms -- may not be getting any broader -- better broadband access either. ", "9838 MR. DANIELS: I agree that there's -- there could -- someone could see a rate increase now who's not receiving five and one and it would take a couple of years to get the five and one to the -- before that community is built out; that is, I recognize what you're suggesting in that, that that's a possibility. ", "9839 But generally, we think as an overall construct, this is a solution that will serve Canadians everywhere and that people who we're suggesting should see a rate increase, it's because that is a just and reasonable rate and there shouldn\u2019t be a subsidy -- there's -- for someone who living in a territory that for some historical reason, is only being charged $31 where someone in the next community is being charged $37. ", "9840 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm almost tempted to ask you your home phone number so that irate customers can phone you directly. ", "9841 Some -- a lot of intervenors are commenting on the quality and experience of the Xplornet solution, and at the same time, we're hearing about upgrades to the capacity of throughput satellites. ", "9842 As experts, are you confident that that solution will pan out? ", "9843 MR. DANIELS: So I don\u2019t think we can speak to someone else's technology or experience in the sense of (inaudible) let Paul to talk about a little bit his experience with direct-to-home. ", "9844 But what I would say is that under our proposal, the question that we asked ourselves was if we believe in technical neutrality. Where does satellite -- direct-to-home satellite fit in? And we think it's important for the Commission to articulate as to whether it does or doesn\u2019t, would they be eligible and the reason for the criteria, why it wouldn\u2019t be, for example, to bid.", "9845 In Connecting Canadians, direct-to-home was not counted as an area in the maps that have been filed with -- the broadband maps that have been filed with the CRTC. Direct-to-home options weren't counted because they had national coverage, but we do think it's in -- you know, it would be important for the CRTC to comment or to, in articulating whatever criteria it is and who's ever eligible, that issue has been -- I'll let Paul talk. ", "9846 MR. FLAHERTY: I think the quality of service, obviously, Xplornet would have to speak to that directly themselves. But if you look at where they offer service, it should pose an opportunity. ", "9847 I was in Iqaluit last Wednesday and Thursday and I had a number of people talk to me in Iqaluit that they have Xplornet service and seem to be happy with the service they have there. ", "9848 When you get into some of the more remote areas, for Nunavut, for example, one of the challenges is having qualified people to install the service. And so the costs of actually getting it installed or getting it installed at all in a timely fashion become a big issue.", "9849 So I would suggest territories like Nunavut, it's probably less practical. Maybe individual communities like Iqaluit that are big enough that can sustain maybe permanent installers, but I would say outside of those areas it's probably less practical. ", "9850 If you get into areas of other parts of the country, again, assuming that Xplornet can deliver on the quality they say they say they can, it should be a practical solution. ", "9851 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, and you're not persuaded by the arguments, and I can't remember who it was, but it was a group from the north, that suggested that maybe that problem of having to fly in and out qualified technicians could be overcome by training locally folks that could support telecommunications more generally in the more remote communities.", "9852 MR. FLAHERTY: It\u2019s a potential. As you know, we serve all of those remote communities, and one of the challenges we have is the volume of activity. So a place like Hall Beach we may have three trouble tickets in an entire month, so it\u2019s very difficult to have someone trained and have them remain current in that technology if they have very little work to do. So I think you\u2019ve got that practical reality, is there enough volume to sustain skilled people in specific locations.", "9853 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "9854 Earlier you said that you endeavour I think to make sure that your customers are well-informed about their choices. And I was wondering if a customer has chronic overages month-to-month what is your practice?", "9855 MR. MALCOLMSON: I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Scott. But the starting point is we do have an online tool where the customer can go monitor his or her own usage and presumably if they see a pattern of chronic overages, as you say, they would call us and see if there\u2019s a better plan for them, if there\u2019s an unlimited option for them. We sell unlimited options. And similarly, we notify our customers as they are starting to reach their data cap. So that\u2019s how we communicate with them.", "9856 Scott may have something else to add.", "9857 MR. BARRETT: No, I\u2019ll just reiterate that we notify our clients from a wireline overage perspective at 90 percent and when they reach 100 percent of their cap. We notify them both via email and what we call a captive portal, a little pop-up on your screen when you try to browse a webpage just to get your attention. And it provides some information to let the customer know, you know, you click here to look yourself, or give us a call and we\u2019ll address potentially moving up to a bigger package if this is going to be a regular occurrence for the customer or if it\u2019s a one of then let them know what any potential overage charges will be at that time.", "9858 MR. MALCOLMSON: We also did a little homework to ask ourselves, as we heard the discussion around overage charges, what percentage of our customers that are on data plans actually experience overage charges, and in the periods we looked at it was about one percent of those that had data caps exceeded them.", "9859 MR. FLAHERTY: The other thing that I can speak on behalf of Northwestel, we have 10 different levels of notification. Obviously in our world data caps are important. So we start at 50 percent, 75 percent, 95, 100, then it goes 110, 120, 130, 140, 150 and then 200. ", "9860 If we run into customers who have had overages continually month-after-month we\u2019ll talk to them about what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re using, make sure they understand. We are finding -- back to your point of education -- that some parents, for example, aren\u2019t fully aware of what others in the household are doing, and so some of that education helps. If it\u2019s a situation where they have got to a place where they can\u2019t afford it we\u2019ll either downgrade them and/or make a payment arrangement for them to pay over time. So we try to be as accommodating as we can.", "9861 THE CHAIRPERSON: So you\u2019re saying the Northwestel territory your practice is somewhat different and you do proactively ---", "9862 MR. FLAHERTY: That\u2019s correct.", "9863 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- do it when there\u2019s month-to-month repetition?", "9864 MR. FLAHERTY: That\u2019s right. And during the month, similar to what Scott mentioned ---", "9865 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. The notifications, I get that, but when you have ---", "9866 MR. FLAHERTY: But we\u2019ll also call people in the month as well if we see them going over.", "9867 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would it be possible for you to provide the Commission with an example of your standard retail home internet contract?", "9868 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes.", "9869 THE CHAIRPERSON: And of course there\u2019s probably cross-references to some associated documents, so if you could include those, things like fair use policy.", "9870 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes.", "9871 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Thank you.", "9872 As I announced earlier, I think we\u2019ll take a break. Those were my questions right now. And I\u2019m sure the panel would like to have a break, and I\u2019m sure that this panel would like to have a break as well. So why don\u2019t we do that and come back at 3:55.", "9873 Thank you.", "--- Upon recessing at 3:40 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 3:58 p.m.", "9874 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: \u00c0 l\u2019ordre s\u2019il vous plait.", "9875 Just before I pass it on to someone else, just to be clear, I mean, your Exhibit 5, which we\u2019ve just received, we may not have had time to fully absorb it, so would you be okay if we had questions, and I\u2019m not saying we do, but if we had questions that we would do so through a request for information put on the record?", "9876 MR. MALCOLMSON: Absolutely. It\u2019s a dense document.", "9877 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. And we wouldn\u2019t do it justice if we were trying to do it too quickly.", "9878 Vice-Chair Menzies please.", "9879 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Just a few, hopefully, quick questions.", "9880 I just want to clarify something starting with VRS. And I may have misheard, but did you say that 1.3 was the requirement for upload for VRS?", "9881 MR. DANIELS: Just give me a second to get the -- sorry -- I want to make sure I got the right numbers here.", "9882 So what I said is the CAV\u2019s answer, so they -- I\u2019m just quoting an undertaking that they gave in response to a question for this proceeding so this is just on the record. CAV said for appropriate quality it would be 737 kilobits per second. So that\u2019s what you need to use VRS. But then they did say that for high quality it would be 1.3 megabits per second needed both ways symmetrical.", "9883 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. So, I mean, VRS is something that people will use for like 911 and that sort of stuff. Should we not be ensuring that there\u2019s high quality there and going to the higher end?", "9884 Because it seems to me like, you know, if we\u2019re fudging with one and that sort of stuff that that\u2019s not necessarily responsible.", "9885 MR. DANIELS: Well, I just -- I guess what we want to be careful in terms of saying like -- if your question is so therefore should we mandate that the definition of basic should be five and 1.3, for example, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s necessary or appropriate because VRS has been used for years with a lot less than one meg up, and in addition, it\u2019s certainly appropriate quality.", "9886 So I think the CAV in terms of that number is sort of saying well as we look out maybe that\u2019s something in terms of for the best quality.", "9887 In addition -- and I could ask Stephanie to talk about -- we actually had some concerns about how they reached some of their numbers, but if you want us to go into that, but from a high level at the end of the day I think appropriate quality of saying it\u2019s less than one means that the basic standard of five and one will make sure that everyone\u2019s served and able to use VRS.", "9888 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. You haven\u2019t convinced me but you did answer the question.", "9889 MR. DANIELS: Well, there\u2019s also -- and I hesitate ---", "9890 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: There\u2019s actually not much point in me fighting with you about it, you have your position and I had the question.", "9891 In terms of the poverty groups, I understand your position that this is an issue for government, but is there any reason why a company of your size couldn\u2019t use its considerable clout to -- and your industry for that matter -- to be willing to take on a little bit of a leadership role in terms of giving profile to this issue or expressing an openness or willingness to work with governments if they were to be convinced -- you give the example of Yukon on the phone -- to work in that area that you would be willing to message to them a willingness to work with them to help address these issues?", "9892 Because I\u2019m just getting tired of telling people to do things, to be honest. It\u2019s just really a lot easier if people actually show some enthusiasm for good work on their own that doesn\u2019t really necessarily cost them any money.", "9893 MR. MALCOLMSON: I think we would be prepared to engage in discussions with other members of our industry as to how we might collectively recommend how to deal with the issue of -- and it's a poverty issue in the context of the services we offer.", "9894 So certainly prepared to have a discussion with our industry and see if we can come up with a collective thought process.", "9895 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. That would be good. Maybe you could -- I don\u2019t want to give you an undertaking on that but it sure would be good to hear back in some form, in some way from -- I'm not just talking to you but from others in terms of how we might work with government. I'm not asking you here to offer up a subsidy in terms of that but to express a willingness to go there. Anyway, enough of that for the moment.", "9896 In terms of accessibility, Mr. Daniels, you mentioned the TAC telephone. Did that -- and it's sort of within this context. I think you have $25 million in deferral account funds for various initiatives including mobile accessibility initiatives to wrap up by 2019. Did that TAC telephone come from that objective?", "9897 MR. DANIELS: Yes, it did.", "9898 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks.", "9899 So what plans do you have beyond -- that $25 million has to be spent by 2019. What plans do you have beyond 2019 to leverage the footprint that you've put in place? In other words, after 2019, is this going to stop or is it going to continue?", "9900 MR. DANIELS: Part of the money that's being used is to create a product lifecycle to be able to renew. And so part of our proposals that have gone through and part of our funding requesting is to be able to fund it in a way that it can be renewed on a going-forward basis. I don\u2019t mean by coming back and asking the Commission for money. I mean to be able to ---", "9901 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Because please don\u2019t.", "9902 MR. DANIELS: What I mean is that the people who went and designed our proposals for the deferral account on the mobility side were very much concerned about product lifecycle. A phone generally doesn't last that long in a product. So they've built been into the budget over the next few years and I think it extends even beyond 2019 in terms of that there would be some lifecycle, so replacement, continuing to do source and find new phone.", "9903 I can't say to you that -- like I think what we're trying to say is we try to set it up in order to be able that we can see out the next five years and have the next five years covered.", "9904 After that, hopefully the business will just continue to do it because it will be part of its setup. But, you know, we -- but we designed our program to be rather than just using it right away the money and the very first year put out a bunch of phones was to try to have not just the support but to have a lifecycle so that the cost of actually sourcing and getting a new phone and keeping it up to date and so on was built into the project for the next few years.", "9905 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So that's yes?", "9906 MR. DANIELS: Yes.", "9907 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Great. Thank you.", "9908 Just again with the Community Hub in Toronto initiative with United Way, just to follow up on that, is that in Toronto only? It's not that it's not a good initiative but it's in Toronto only.", "9909 MR. MALCOLMSON: Yes.", "9910 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Any plans to expand that? It was just when you said it, I was thinking of the -- ah, I unfortunately forget her name, the woman who was in the Dartmouth office last week who had eight kids and that sort of stuff. So any opportunities you're looking at to expand that sort of initiative to other centres?", "9911 MR. MALCOLMSON: I think as we build in other centres, I would think that thought would be given to replicating the idea. It seems to be working well in Toronto. So is there a plan today? No. Is it a good idea that seems to be working? Yes. So it's something we would certainly look at.", "9912 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sure, and that's a good place to start. But, you know, Rogers has their issue which they've just expanded, announced that they're expanding outside of Toronto, but I would never want to say that it's not good to see Toronto well served but it is a national system and it would be -- if it's good work there, it would be, I expect, inspirational to you to continue to do good work elsewhere too.", "9913 In terms of the subsidized rates that you're talking about in particular to the north and remote areas and that sort of stuff, do you see those -- because you talked about having the retail rates at a sort of comparable -- comparable rate. Do you see those rates staying fixed for a while or do you see them moving with the market?", "9914 MR. DANIELS: We see them moving with the market, whatever direction. But again, the point is we don\u2019t see this as a standalone here's my product for -- just take the area, put it into our regular offers. Our offers are generally province-wide or territory-wide. So the rates, you know, would move with the market and when I say that, let's be clear that there's two different things.", "9915 We have lots of customers who are on grandfathered plans. That's the rate they bought. A new customer comes on, they may not necessarily get that rate. So I just want to be clear that I'm not trying to say that everyone\u2019s rates would change as we change our rates. They would just be treated like all other customers are in the province.", "9916 We have generally province-wide pricing and so to the extent that they were on an equivalent rate of 5/5, as that rate would change for new customers who sign up, new customers in that territory would get the advantage of whatever that new rate was.", "9917 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "9918 And maybe for Mr. Flaherty, because I've asked others and these folks are arriving next week, there's interventions on the record regarding the potential impact of low-orbit, low-latency satellites who propose to fix everything. So prior to their appearance, it's only fair to have response and other views of particularly from somebody who is well versed in the satellite challenge.", "9919 MR. FLAHERTY: Thank you very much for the question.", "9920 Very much we're looking at that as a possibility. Of course, there isn\u2019t any today that we can actually test and try out. So we've engaged in a discussion with one particular company that we're trying to look at what we can do from a virtual perspective in terms of modelling what the virtual possibilities are, but we've only just begun this.", "9921 So probably within the next year we'll be in a much better place to answer that question but it's hopeful at least if anything close to what they offer comes through.", "9922 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you. I think that's it for me. Thank you.", "9923 THE CHAIRPERSON: Appears to be all our questions then. So you had to work over lunch but you get to finish early today. Thank you very much.", "9924 So we're adjourned until 9 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning.

Order, please. ", "9928 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. Good morning. ", "9929 We will now hear the presentation of Roslyn Layton. Ms. Layton is appearing by Skype. ", "9930 Ms. Layton, you can hear us well?", "9931 MS. LAYTON: Yes, thank you. ", "9932 THE SECRETARY: Perfect. You may begin your presentation. You have 10 minutes. Thank you. ", "PRESENTATION", "9933 MS. LAYTON: Yes, good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to present today.", "9934 My name is Roslyn Layton, and I'm a PhD fellow at the Centre for Communication Media and Information Technologies in the Department of Electronic Systems at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, Denmark. ", "9935 I'm honoured to share my thoughts on the important topic of basic services in Canada, and I want to commend the CRTC on its inclusive process to solicit feedback from a diverse group of stakeholders.", "9936 THE SECRETARY: Ms. Layton? ", "9937 MS. LAYTON: Yes? ", "9938 THE SECRETARY: Can you please talk slower for the interpretation? Thank you.", "9939 MS. LAYTON: Of course. ", "9940 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. ", "9941 MS. LAYTON: So thank you, CRTC, for this process that you have used to solicit the diverse group of stakeholders and all of their views and your effort to commission a report about how Canadians use the internet. ", "9942 My comments today offer a critical academic view of the debate and assumption of basic services policies. My goal is to offer creative, out-of-the-box thinking to achieve policy goals in a more effective and perhaps unorthodox way.", "9943 These points have been published in a peer review academic journal as well as in a magazine for ICOM, the leading professional association for regulators. ", "9944 I speak on this topic at various conferences and events in a pro-bono basis to fulfil my academic requirements at the university. ", "9945 Some telecom policy can benefit users tremendously, while bad ideas can be terribly costly. Exhibit A is the Universal Services Fund and lifeline programs in the United States where tens of billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse have been noted. ", "9946 However, when done right, telecom policy can help lift the poorest and least fortunate among us to an improved quality of life. Few, if any, technologies or industries have the potential to create so much good for so many. ", "9947 But resources are limited and as such, policy-makers need the courage and fortitude to test their assumptions.", "9948 Simply copy pasting ideas from the past will not necessarily solve today's problems. My purpose is to provide inspiration and I represent myself and do not speak on behalf of any other party. ", "9949 First, we need to start with a discussion of a popular service. In recent years, as more and more users access Facebook with mobile devices, the company has re-engineered its mobile platform, decreasing average monthly data use from 14 megabits down to one. ", "9950 Not only does this lower the long-term operating costs for Facebook, it improves the user experience and it takes less data from their subscription. Better service design also improves the throughput on the network.", "9951 The point of this story is that when it comes to basic services, we tend to think very much about the broadband network or whatever telecom network's there, but we really should be focusing on the third-party services and how to optimize them. ", "9952 In my remarks today, I will address two of the assumptions of basic service policy and some of the shortcomings and these premises are that high speeds are needed for essential services and applications and that people in remote areas are somehow limited in their participation on the internet because of only having a single provider. ", "9953 To craft the best policy, I suggest to the CRTC that they should focus on the specific applications that belong in what I call a \"basic services bundle\". ", "9954 Your March 30 report indicates what those services could be, for example, mailing, reading news online, medical information, banking, and government websites. ", "9955 Rural residents also mention the importance of voice, social media, education, employment, and shopping.", "9956 Thus, ensuring that the basic bundle is available on all networks, ideally with an optimal service design along with the appropriate network management, is a defendable basic service policy. ", "9957 Operators could then offer packages, market and disclosed as for basic services, ideally at a competitive price.", "9958 Importantly, entertainment and other discretionary services are not appropriate for the basic services bundle, and those should be priced and managed flexibly. ", "9959 So the first faulty premise that I want to address is that essential applications and services need high speeds. ", "9960 Now, if we look back in the past in the basic -- the history of basic service and universal service, the finding of policy was relatively easy because there was just one network and one service to provision, voice over the copper wire. ", "9961 But today there are near infinite number of services, many networks, so the notion of (inaudible) and what held true for the telephone service onto every other network is not tenable. ", "9962 Given the inherent technical and economic differences between networks, it makes far more sense to focus on the services that run across them. After all, people don\u2019t adopt networks, they adopt services. Demand for broadband is not for the network itself, but for the services it delivers, also called derived demand. ", "9963 Of the essential services Canadian mentioned in the CRTC report, none of them require high speed broadband connections. Moreover, the CRTC report said at least 7 in 10 Canadians are satisfied with the reliability and speed of their home internet service, and only 1 in 5 or fewer are dissatisfied. ", "9964 In addition, this proceeding has noted the deaf and blind communities' need for prioritization and quality of service, which are not related to speed. ", "9965 As such, the focus on the network speed as a measure of basic service is somewhat off the mark. The speed that a user experiences is not a function of the network so much as it is of the user's device and the user's application. ", "9966 Building new wire-line networks is the most expensive, cumbersome solution to improve basic service. The same objectives could be achieved across a range of solutions, such as compression technologies, local storage, deployment of wireless networks, and upgrade of service software protocols. Moreover, it is far more cost-effective to focus on service design and delivery, and far more flexible.", "9967 I submit that the call to high speed is an implicit appeal to inherently emotional issues. It creates a sense that the only way to support quality digital services is to support extensive regulatory intervention with subsidies, obligations, and mandated contribution programs. ", "9968 At best, this represents a misunderstanding of basic services' actual requirements, and may also represent a desire, on the part of broadband advocates to assert an idealized view. While laudable, it doesn\u2019t synch with the way that people use their services in practice. ", "9969 At worst, it's a deliberate tactic used as an emotional appeal to advocate for a preferred policy that is otherwise not supportable by the technical requirements. ", "9970 Moreover, a misguided focus on speed does not address the key reason why people don\u2019t adopt the internet in the first place. As studies from Pew and the Centre for the Digital Future attest, that low adoption of the internet is not related to cost dispute at all but rather concerns about usability, relevance, and online harms.", "9971 If Canadians find no reason today to adopt the internet, offering them a higher speed connection is not an incentive to start. ", "9972 The second faulty premise I will address is that people in remote areas have limited participation in the internet because of their location or the presence of only a single provider. ", "9973 It's a fact of the matter that being in a remote location would actually increase the likelihood of adoption, and there is no more relevant case for Canada than Greenland, where digital health and education services have had near-universal adoption for almost a decade. It is the user-friendly design of the service which drives its adoption, in spite of the prevailing speed of only one megabit per second. ", "9974 If you have been to Greenland, you will know that there's no calling 9-1-1 and waiting for an ambulance. As such, digital health is extremely important, therefore, telling Greenland the monopoly provider prioritizes network for medical services. ", "9975 I suggest that Canadian providers be allowed the full leeway to manage the network in a socially responsible fashion. ", "9976 What is basic and essential should be prioritized and delivered most cost effectively. Thereafter, discretionary services can be offered with flexible management and pricing. ", "9977 Similar limitations such as low bandwidth environments can actually drive innovation, as my colleagues in India are working on videoconferencing solutions on just one megabit environments. ", "9978 In conclusion, I want to thank you for the opportunity to share these points. I hope you will see the merit of the view that the focus on service delivery and design is a more cost-effective way to create universal service. Network metric requirements, while appearing authoritative, are, I submit, inferior to creating the social value to which the CRTC is so committed.", "9979 I opened my remarks with a story about Facebook. Now, let me give you one more quick example. There is an emerging model of basic service now enjoyed by 25 million new internet users around the world; it\u2019s called Free Basics. It\u2019s a platform optimized for future phones and low-bandwidth environments to deliver essential services for messaging, news, health, and weather. ", "9980 In barely one year, the program has grown across 37 countries with no cost to public coffers. I\u2019m hard-pressed to find a similar regulator-produced basic service policy which delivers so much adoption so quickly at so little cost. ", "9981 The point of this example is simply to demonstrate that with no regulatory requirements at all telecom operators and service providers can work together to participate in the important project of digital adoption and universal service. If the goal is to maximize the social value of basic service policy, there is no reason why the relevant application providers should not be part of the solution. ", "9982 The example should be a source of inspiration for Canadian innovators to make their own optimized platforms with Canadian apps, services, and devices to be marketed and bundled in a compelling way. This could also address price concerns by offering cost-optimized bundles for basic service; such a bundling is win-win. ", "9983 Canadian users, especially the 13 percent who have not adopted the internet, would have an incentive to try. Canadian app providers and device-makers could strengthen their audience through complementary network effects and Canadian broadband providers would have additional means to conduct price and service competition.", "9984 Good telecom policy is rarely simple. As such, the CRTC should resist the pressure to make binary interpretations of the world where critical views can ultimately deliver better social outcomes.", "9985 Thank you very much for this opportunity to present and I look forward to your questions.", "9986 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much, Dr. Layton. ", "9987 Commissioner from Alberta and Northwest Territory, Dr. Linda Vennard, will ask you questions first. Thank you.", "9988 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good morning. I\u2019m not sure what time it is there but good afternoon, good evening, whatever time is there.", "9989 MS. LAYTON: Three o\u2019clock.", "9990 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Three o\u2019clock. Good afternoon. It\u2019s morning here in Canada.", "9991 I\u2019m also an academic and I would -- I read your paper with great interest and would really like to have an academic discussion with you. And I\u2019m looking forward to that one of these days. But right now I\u2019m mindful of the fact that we are looking at regulation here. So I\u2019m going to converse with you on a little but different level.", "9992 Having said that, I would like to just get your thoughts on one sort of basic thing. We\u2019ve been thinking about how to look at policy. We\u2019ve been thinking about how to frame something like a strategy; we\u2019ve been thinking about how to frame something like a basic service objective. And your own thinking actually lines up very, very closely with the way I think about things and that is that you -- you sort of outline this in the paper that you provided -- that you asked to provide. ", "9993 And we basically are moving into an area where we started off with a set -- in terms of a society, we started off with a set of social commitments of some kind and then we move in to using technology to leverage and support our social commitments. And now we seem to have gone around a corner where the technology itself is the social commitment. Do you have thoughts on that?", "9994 MS. LAYTON: I think that\u2019s a very compelling idea. I understand that evolution that you\u2019re talking about.", "9995 What I would -- and I\u2019m glad that there\u2019s an opportunity, maybe, to exchange it on an academic level. I\u2019m happy to send you some academic references that discuss this sort of, what you might call, a synthesis or some kind of evolution. ", "9996 I understand the technology being a social commitment. What I would also say is though, from a regulatory perspective -- as you have said, this is important to this discussion -- but I\u2019ll give you the example of the regulations in Denmark. There was actually a process here that dismantled much of the Telecom Regulatory Authority, and replaced the employees across four government agencies on the idea that the expertise of the regulators was better deployed in the various public sector functions.", "9997 So they had a notion that of course the technology is important but the expertise was needed to help, for example, the hospital, the education deployment, transportation -- intelligent transportation, smart cities, and what have you.", "9998 So I would certainly agree the importance of the technology but it also is that the technology is not an end in itself; it is the enablement of the technology for some kind of a social outcome or some social value. So my only academic critique of that is to say yes, while I agree with the technology, we all have to bring it back to what is the social value to be delivered and the outcome. ", "9999 So I think then when you look at an everyday-basic service policy, you know, yes, you can create a fee requirement and deliver it to the speed but does that really mean that you are delivering the social value? So you know, I think maybe there\u2019s an additional place to take the discussion.", "10000 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, I agree with you and I think that that\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re all wrestling with is that idea of the -- you know, what comes first? It seems like sometimes we prioritize the technology and we forefront it and -- but it has become -- in terms of what we\u2019re dealing with here in our Commission, it has become the social commitment. ", "10001 And within that social commitment is embodied the responsibilities that we have for our society. For example, a really good example of that would be towards the disabled community and so on. So that technology, that broadband, actually embodies what our social commitments are at this time. And I think that we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re not there yet but I think we\u2019re concept -- in terms of just conceptualizing what it is that we\u2019re doing and the broad sort of framework that we\u2019re looking at. ", "10002 I think it\u2019s a rather provocative idea and it\u2019s definitely one that I picked up the underpinnings for in your paper as well. So that\u2019s something that you might want to actually give a little bit of thought to as well because I certainly saw that all through your -- the paper that I read.", "10003 Now, if we start from the point where we say the technology -- the communication technology is actually the social commitment -- and in fact it is the social commitment that we\u2019re -- I mean a social obligation that we\u2019re dealing with here on the commission. Then we would probably benefit from a set of principles that might guide us towards our regulation in terms of the way we think about how we should even regulate something like this.", "10004 And of course the starting place for this is needs versus wants or speed; there\u2019s all these other different sorts of things. So perhaps I can just ask you to give us your thoughts on the difference between the needs and the wants. What do you think the needs are and what should be the wants? ", "10005 And of course you\u2019ve alluded to that when you talked about basic services should be for -- think of basic services in one way and then discretionary services which people can purchase as they can any other product if they want. So what are your thoughts on needs and wants?", "10006 MS. LAYTON: Certainly. Well, first of all, as I mentioned in my remarks, I wanted to applaud the CRTC to have -- to do the report. I think that that was a very important first step. What\u2019s (inaudible) to me as I\u2019m sure it was to you, that it is a case, you know, certainly what maybe of value. But this also says to me that it does require really examining all the (inaudible).", "10007 I think that in many respects this idea about technology that we sort of get caught up in sort of managing to the network but not really understanding what\u2019s the value that\u2019s running across. And I think as your hearing has demonstrated, for example, the needs of the deaf and blind community are not the same as -- there are many communities who have different needs.", "10008 So often the important thing is the flexibility that operators will need to have to deliver the kinds of quality of service for different kinds of services and that whatever regulations are there that they don\u2019t constrain the ability to deliver those services. So in theory you could have unlimited kind of wants; if your network was (inaudible) managed, it could in fact do that.", "10009 I think that to the most degree you can improve the design of the application, the more (inaudible) that you\u2019ll have on a network, the more capacity you can get from your network. So I mean, for example, if we went back 150 years and you said, \u201cWell, as the Horse and Buggy Commission, we need to make sure that there are lots of those\u201d and had only managed those, we wouldn\u2019t have imagined that something else might come about.", "10010 But my point is to say that human needs may be delivered in a variety of ways and so what we might be able to pin down today whether the wants or whether the needs. That may shift over time very quickly as we find different ways to address that.", "10011 So what I would get -- what I would come back -- my sense is that it would be important to have done the surveys that you did to understand that there\u2019s a lot more that the service providers can do, that is to say the application provider. They have incentives to improve the design of their service.", "10012 What I can say from -- what I know from my colleagues in the engineering section where we work with compression technology, that most providers of video, maybe less than 20 percent, actually do the appropriate video compression so that the networks that we have today could actually be utilized much better and have much better throughput if the application providers did a better job.", "10013 So, you know, I would say you could actually address a lot more needs -- a lot more of these things by having a better design of the application; you could use the network better. And it theoretically could allow many more possibilities. That can exist without regulatory requirements. ", "10014 We have already seen, and therefore I want to use the example of the Free Basics and Facebook. Facebook is just an open platform and people said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s try it.\u201d And the key thing about that platform is that the applications continue to be -- how would you say -- simplified to deliver the key services that people need. So lots of superfluous things are going away, and they really focus on what the end users want. And it ends up making them much better services being adopted by more.", "10015 So I\u2019m (inaudible) to exactly answer your question other than to say there\u2019s a lot of input that need to be part of this question. And that I was talking against boiling things down and saying, well, if we have this XYZ speed requirement which (inaudible) because in reality there\u2019s, you know, a lot more going on. And you should also involve a lot more of the parts of the ecosystem to contribute to making a better utilization of the network.", "10016 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: But don\u2019t you think that there needs to be a standardization and an obligation that people have a certain speed and a certain quality of service on a network in order to get up to that service level?", "10017 MS. LAYTON: Well ---", "10018 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: You know, that\u2019s one of the basic things that we have to look at here is ---", "10019 MS. LAYTON: Sure.", "10020 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: You know, because if we sort of take it apart and we say we have to look at the network, we have to look at the broadband network or the cable network or whatever, the entire network. And that has to be, you know, equal for everybody in order to get up to the level of the services and the discretionary services and thinking that might go on in that level.", "10021 MS. LAYTON: Right. Well, I certainly appreciate -- I appreciate where you\u2019re coming from. I recognize you have this important social goal which you want to deliver. When I read the statistics about Canada I had a sense that there\u2019s actually quite a bit of satisfaction of users from their speed.", "10022 So what I would weigh though -- well, my view -- is that I would say that in terms of the social value, to -- at the cost of making everything equal for everyone you may actually make a greater value by let\u2019s say focusing on those who are hurting the most, for example.", "10023 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. ", "10024 MS. LAYTON: And I think this is the question right now they\u2019re addressing in the U.S. with Lifeline Program. They submit that Lifeline, giving a $10 subsidy to let\u2019s say 40 million households, or it could be a $30 subsidy to two million households. There\u2019s a huge difference there. And in fact, the latter option would be better to address fewer households with more money but they\u2019re taking the former option.", "10025 So what I would say is I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s important that everyone has to be -- that this service has to improve everything equally across the board. I think the idea would be to focus on those who need the most help because in many respects Canada is so far ahead of countries around the world that I think you do tend to look at everything from the winner\u2019s position where you\u2019ve accomplished so much. ", "10026 And I would say that, you know, the improvements to be made are quite marginal, you know, especially when you look at the perspectives of some of the other countries who have nowhere near the success and accomplishment that Canada has made.", "10027 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: In your submission, and also in your paper, you are quite critical of classifying or defining something like streaming video and so on as a basic service. It seems that you consider it to be entertainment. And would you say that that should not be part of the basic service, the capacity for that? Or how would you fit that into the mix that we\u2019re dealing with here?", "10028 MS. LAYTON: Sure. Well, entertainment is a very challenging issue because in fact it has many substitutes. You know, maybe one person wants to read a book, another person wants to watch a movie, someone wants to play checkers. You know, there are many -- so entertainment is really hard to define.", "10029 However, there are things like applying for a job where we don\u2019t have another option than to use the internet. So the use of an IM (inaudible) entertainment is in the sense that it\u2019s not essential. It\u2019s highly elastic, it\u2019s highly differentiated to people. ", "10030 However, the things like emailing, getting news, applying for a job, government, those are things where the internet is the only option and those have to be -- those would definitely be something one would classify as essential. ", "10031 So I think this is a challenge where, in my opinion, the CRTC needs to make a decision. It\u2019s hard to make decisions. There are probably some companies who are not happy about that. ", "10032 On the other hand, this is also an innovator\u2019s opportunity. There are kinds of contents that are essential for Canadians, the Canadian citizens (inaudible) their taxes and so on, and there could be a case that those things could be important. And also, it could be a reason to say could the video platforms be improved so that they could be delivered more efficiently?", "10033 So, you know, what I would say is I could see arguments for socially beneficial entertainment. This could be (inaudible) that we know that\u2019s valuable for all Canadians. It\u2019s something very different than what Hollywood might consider Canadians should see. So I believe that there\u2019s a distinction. ", "10034 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "10035 There\u2019s also a space there where -- and you mentioned innovation yourself -- where innovation operates too. So even though something might not be absolutely essential to a person\u2019s health or their banking or whatever, if you look at -- and staff cleverly pointed this out to me -- that when it comes to things like streaming video and so on where, you know, we\u2019re able to have this conversation with you because of that. ", "10036 So in a sense through your paper you\u2019re sort of critical of the very thing that is enabling us to have this conversation with you, and expand our views, and search out different ways to think about things. ", "10037 So when it comes to innovation if there isn\u2019t room to innovate -- in the same way, I mean, we talk about innovation as sort of like the optimization that you mentioned with engineers. They design to the constraints. ", "10038 And innovation in some ways I think is exactly the same thing, where if you constrain then different things will happen, but yet on the other hand you can constrain too far too. ", "10039 And that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re dealing with here too is that we want to be able to look into the future. We want to be able to prepare our country for the future, not just right now and what\u2019s the minimum now, what\u2019s the ceiling now sort of thing. Where we\u2019re trying to establish a floor, if you will.", "10040 So what would you say about when it comes to innovation? If we constrain things too tightly and we define basic services too tightly then where do we go with it?", "10041 MS. LAYTON: Right. Well, so as we know, (inaudible) can also be a constraint. There are many constraints then. Maybe perhaps it\u2019s a -- (inaudible) is a question of constraint optimization about so many things that we\u2019ve been looking at.", "10042 One of the things to keep in mind would be (inaudible), and I believe I discuss this in the paper, this position that what we\u2019ve seen is the existing networks we have continued to accommodate more throughput because of the various technologies that they employ.", "10043 And I think certainly from the broadband providers\u2019 perspective, the ability that they can squeeze more throughput out of the network is so much better for them if they can offer more services, sell more subscriptions, and so on. So it\u2019s absolutely in their interest as well.", "10044 But what I would say is, in my estimation, that to date the application providers have not done enough. We have essentially had a sort of regime that people indiscriminately put their content on the internet and expect it all to be delivered and so on. ", "10045 And I believe that the application providers bear more responsibility than they have in the past and that they should do a better job in design; they should pay more for the delivery, and so on. We have seen this in the broadcast industry where they have done much more to lower the cost to the end user. ", "10046 So I think that it\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not fair that it should be the sole responsibility of the broadband provider and then the cost goes on to the consumer. I think that the application providers also need to be a part of the equation.", "10047 But the other thing I would say is -- and one of the challenges if you look at basic service policies around the world, you know, I have colleagues who study these in different countries but the focus is very much on the telephone network. But the way that we have been delivering connectivity has been through mobiles, where we haven\u2019t had basic service requirements at all in many places. ", "10048 So the real question is, what is -- is the innovation, is it of the market forces that are allowing the competition and the dynamism prefers to serve the market needs, or is it the, you know, the regulatory policy that enforces it? ", "10049 Now I\u2019m sure we can have a lot of discussion about that, but what I would say is that it\u2019s not clear to me that the essential services the Canadians want -- need more than five megabytes. But I think that that\u2019s a defendable level. If you look at other countries, in Denmark there\u2019s only a one megabyte universal service requirement. ", "10050 So I think that that\u2019s a defendable number. I don\u2019t think that it needs to be higher than that, but it\u2019s also an opportunity for the innovation to come from the application level.", "10051 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So in your view, even though you don\u2019t necessarily think that the thing to focus on would be speed, but we need to consider in a very real sense some of these numbers, do you think five and one is something that would be adequate for a basic service for people?", "10052 MS. LAYTON: I didn\u2019t get the last part.", "10053 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you think that five and one would be something that\u2019s adequate for a basic service objective? The speed?", "10054 MS. LAYTON: Yes.", "10055 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "10056 MS. LAYTON: Absolutely.", "10057 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: What other dimensions of the network should go into our thinking? Quality of service, you mentioned jitter, you mentioned latency, packet loss I believe also came into your discussion in your paper. How -- what else do you think is important when we\u2019re looking at that?", "10058 MS. LAYTON: Well, what I would say, you know, I -- because I think -- and as your proceedings have demonstrated, there are very diverse group of different needs among the various communities. What I\u2019m concerned about is too much constraint on the operators being able to deliver the requested prioritizations that the users want, the different levels of, you know -- and even what they left. With more internet things you will have many devices that won\u2019t need to have, you know, that won\u2019t need to have, you know, the -- their requirements are much less.", "10059 So I would say this is very important to me is that the other -- the basic service should be very crisply circumscribed. And that only those things that we know today are essential should be part of it. Precisely because so many of the other services, we don\u2019t know what the business case is, we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to be used, and we\u2019re not even sure what kinds of dimensions will be necessary. I wish we all had a crystal ball and we knew in the future what that would be, but we don\u2019t today.", "10060 So I mean, I think you do have good evidence that there are a set of things that are extremely valuable for Canadians that should be accessible by all. But we don\u2019t -- it\u2019s very difficult to say what is important for internet and what for every deal and so on. I think that you should leave those things alone and let them evolve. And if it\u2019s that time that it becomes important, then take it up. ", "10061 But it seems that what you could -- what is defendable and what would be the, you know, what is a modest and I would say a realistic way to deliver the same for all Canadians would be a five one.", "10062 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And do you think we should have other quality of service metrics that we should consider as well when it would come to our formal definition?", "10063 MS. LAYTON: In that case I think that -- in that example I think maybe the better approach is to allow whatever the specific -- whatever the -- rather than generalize it around a feed, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a someone and they need a certain kind of package. The lesser operator sell that package with all of this associated requirements. And then regulate to that requirement for that package, not for everything across the board. And so that you can allow those offer to exist and it doesn\u2019t -- so that what they, you know, the -- the problem is, you put everything in a bundle, it\u2019s not allowing so that the video component will tend to overshadow the other things, that they don\u2019t get the kind of service level they need. ", "10064 What I would say is to allow the various offers to take place and then regulate them as they\u2019re disclosed. If you need to have, you know, a symmetrical prioritized service, this is the package to buy, I want these features, and then regulate from that contract, rather than impose something from the very beginning.", "10065 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So and that would be at the service level then? The network would be -- because you tend to be -- through your -- our discussion and also your paper you tend to divide those two things up into sort of the delivery and then the service level and the discretionary basic -- there seems to be different divisions that are going on there. ", "10066 So you think that that\u2019s something that should be dealt with depending on what the needs of the user are in that community?", "10067 MS. LAYTON: Absolutely. I think there should be more flexibility for the user to, you know, to get the specialized service that\u2019s needed. And then that can be, you know, provided on that individual situation rather than to assume that one standard will take care of everything.", "10068 I recognize the beauty of having one standard that fits it all, but in practice, I know that that doesn\u2019t work, that there has to be more flexibility.", "10069 Now granted, network for the future will become better and better at doing that. As we\u2019re moving from 4G to 5G, we\u2019re getting more flexibility. That will become easier on its own. So I don\u2019t think that the regulatory requirement will do that better than the network dynamics in any case.", "10070 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I just have one or two shorter questions for you.", "10071 In your research, have you been able to ascertain whether residential and small enterprises have similar needs in terms of quality of service or are there different needs? And in part I think you\u2019ve addressed that.", "10072 MS. LAYTON: Well, so the -- so looking at the example of Greenland, which I think is definitely a special case when you\u2019ve got 55,000 people in this extremely remote environment. So there, I mean, I would say it\u2019s a very out of the box way to solve the issues but it\u2019s relevant for the people there. And this was something architected, you know, going back to 2008 and before. ", "10073 So if we truly understand the application design can take the form that it needs, are there -- are issues around the changing of devices and the configuration. If you just had assumed five -- you know, five megabytes service, it wouldn\u2019t address the needs in case of Greenland because they have work stations that are set up with the spirometers and ECGs and what have you. So there\u2019s a lot of things required on the device in that particular case.", "10074 So that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say is depending upon the community and their particular needs, they may find a way to solve the problem accessibly and that just simply saying a speed number or a latency number may not address what they need.", "10075 So there -- as I said again, the flexibility is important.", "10076 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So I have just one more comment that I\u2019d like you to comment on. And of course, I can\u2019t leave you without going back to the beginning of where we started where I suggested that perhaps the technology itself is the social commitment that we\u2019re making.", "10077 Throughout your paper and your submission, a few times, you know, I certainly picked up that you seem to suggest that the technology is sort of taking over. It\u2019s sometimes being putting the cart before the horse or any other -- of these other clich\u00e9s. ", "10078 So I\u2019d like to just hear your comment on one thing. And of course, you\u2019ll recognize who this is too. I\u2019m wondering, has the servant become the master?", "10079 MS. LAYTON: Well, I mean, what we could -- I hope maybe we could have another chance to talk because we have a number of classes on social constructions of technology and, you know, the various philosophers and how -- I mean, what I would say is I can find examples of every one of these different interpretations of is technology in charge and who\u2019s not in charge and so on. ", "10080 And so I would say, you know, all of these things going on at the same time, the -- I would say what does it mean for regulators? I think the important thing for regulators is because you have such an important role, there\u2019s a tendency I think to overthink the role and say oh, we must do everything in the most magnificent, beautiful way, as opposed to doing something at a modest level that is justified by the technical requirements, that\u2019s justified by what the needs and evidence say. ", "10081 It may not be, you know, the headline in the New York Times, but it\u2019s meaningful for what, you know, for the everyday user. And so I submit that that is a far more noble and important way to deliver the regulatory and social commitment. Not by, you know, reinventing the internet but by, you know, ensuring that the basic needs are addressed for all Canadians.", "10082 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Well, those are all my questions and comments and it was nice talking with you this morning.", "10083 MS. LAYTON: Same here. Thank you.", "10084 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Thank you.", "10085 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much, Dr. Layton. Those are our questions and thanks again for having participated in the hearing. And as you know, there\u2019s a further -- at least one further phase in the proceeding so you might want to participate in that as well. Thank you.", "10086 MS. LAYTON: Thank you.", "10087 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.", "--- (SHORT PAUSE) ", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "--- Upon recessing at 10:58 p.m. ", "--- Upon resuming at 11:16 p.m. ", "10570 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. We will now hear the presentation of Axia Netmedia Corp. Please introduce yourself and you have 10 minutes for your presentation.", "10571 THE CHAIRPERSON: If you press the little button the mic light will come on and we will hear you better.", "PRESENTATION", "10572 MR. PRICE: All right. Thank you.", "10573 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "10574 MR. PRICE: I\u2019m Art Price, Chairman and CEO of Axia Netmedia and we\u2019ve made a submission which I\u2019m sure people have had a chance to look at. ", "10575 I thought given the Chairman\u2019s comments about the purpose of the hearing that I would take a bit of a shot in the opening remarks at the bigger policy questions and invite any questions, of course. ", "10576 So if your core question is does Canada have a national broadband strategy, I would say -- the purpose of a national broadband strategy is to enable Canada to compete in the global marketplace and against that test Canada has no broadband strategy.", "10577 Not to worry too much, other countries do not. Example, the United States has no coherent national broadband strategy. Neither does the United Kingdom. ", "10578 On the other hand some do, but they failed at execution. That would be Australia.", "10579 They would say they have a major broadband strategy, but it\u2019s a mess and it\u2019s failing. Yet others have efficient high performing compelling broadband strategies. Two examples of that would be Singapore and France.", "10580 I\u2019ve personally been in sessions like this in France, Spain, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada and the United States, and I thought it might be useful to just kind of reflect on what is actually working and not working from a policy point of view around the world where essentially we\u2019re talking about developed competing economies as opposed to underdeveloped economies.", "10581 So what do we need? We need a ubiquitous digital connectivity that is fit for a purpose and does not rely on ongoing subsidies from government. That\u2019s a core tenant to a competing framework.", "10582 What are the fundamentals of winning strategies? Well, first of all, it\u2019s customer focused, focused solely and put at the top of the list the customer and subordinating the historical industry to that objective.", "10583 Around the world the industry is a legacy industry and frankly it needs transformation in order to allow a companied infrastructure to compete, so winning policies put the end user ahead of the industry.", "10584 Secondly, to set up a regulatory framework for a new sector, which in our paper we call new basic infrastructure. It\u2019s fibre as infrastructure in its own right. And make it viable from a framework point of view to new kind of capital called infrastructure capital. That creates new players. And so the policy framework is not reliant on legacy, telco and cableco discretionary cash flow and the regulatory parties negotiating subsidies in order for them to invest their money. So that\u2019s the second tenant of the real winning policy frameworks.", "10585 The third is they don\u2019t mix social needs agenda with the private sector focus. So the government has a job of providing support on a social support basis but the winning policy frameworks put that in the social support category not in the network broadband basic infrastructure category. They don\u2019t funnel it through the private sector network investor.", "10586 When Axia considers investing in another country our first question is is the digital connectivity a priority at the national leadership and if it\u2019s not we pass; our second question is does the leadership agree that the countries and users interests are more important than the historical telco, cableco interest, if they don\u2019t agree with that we pass, because both those things pull you back into a history.", "10587 This is because digital connectivity and web service debate. And what I mean by web services is everything digital that travels over a network, so a video is web service, a telephone call is web service, all of them that travel over a digital network we call web services. That concept of ubiquitous digital connectivity and web service availability is not an incremental decision from the old it\u2019s a transformational change to the industry and the marketplace.", "10588 So the regulator and the government must be committed to the end users lasting interest. The Government of Alberta took some of the challenge -- of this challenge 10, 12 years ago and used this approach to partner with Axia and the result of that is on your CRTC map where Alberta clearly leads the rest of the country in terms of digital connectivity all using this same basic new approach.", "10589 So in this approach, a bit about the question about roles. So what is the role of the CRTC in this context? It would start by strategically unbundling web services, cloud, telephone, TV, radio from the new fibre and wireless infrastructure. Secondly, it would create the new sector alternative in both fibre and wireless infrastructure and in web services to different sectors.", "10590 What\u2019s the new sector? It\u2019s the guys that bring new capital, not historical cash flow, and justify their investments based on a standalone investment criteria.", "10591 The result is making the telco and cableco\u2019s compete with the new sectors. The new sector doesn\u2019t replace them they just compete with it. Give the customer choice. Let the new basic infrastructure be sponsored grassroots up from the municipal or provincial level.", "10592 What would be the role of the industry sectors? So there\u2019s the wireless sector. Compete from a level playing field using access to new infrastructure, fibre and towers. Fulfil obligations on coverage and broadband performance or lose their licence.", "10593 The new infrastructure sector would create these open access fibre grids and towers deployed within the infrastructure framework and meeting private sector economic discipline. ", "10594 And on social access and affordability, the government would fund that direct to the customer, whether that\u2019s provincial, federal, or municipal, as opposed to trying to indirectly fund it through the facilities themselves.", "10595 What about rural remote versus metro? See how far the private sector infrastructure plus wireless new ecosystem can go without financial support, than consider whether financial support is necessary to extend that infrastructure further.", "10596 This kind of framework basically pulls you into two fundamental decisions. The first is do you separate web services, which is all digital services, from the network transport or not, and if you do you get to go it on one path and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re kind of in the historical path. The second is set the framework so that new outside telco, cableco capital outside that historical sector is a player or not. And then -- and so the question is do you rely on cableco, telco cash flow prioritization or not. ", "10597 After those two decisions a lot becomes quite clear. The focus would be on fibre and wireless. Copper would not get any funding. Under this kind of framework the old telco copper is over and done. Everybody in the industry knows that, even the telco\u2019s know that because they put in fibre to replace the copper. It\u2019s just where they have to or where they want to as opposed to whether the copper is good enough.", "10598 You would develop new regulatory recognition of this fibre infrastructure sector. It would be -- have to be private. It would have to be open and equal access. It would have to stay out of the web services sector. And it would be viable for private sector infrastructure capital, and you would see how far it can go without any financial support.", "10599 A third point is looking at 5-1 -- five down one up. In this policy framework I would say it\u2019s old copper centric and the old copper is over. So it should not be a core tenant of a broadband strategy it is a tenant of a social support strategy.", "10600 So I pull the two apart and say 5-1 is not a broadband strategy because if we had 5-1 in Canada and that was our broadband strategy we\u2019d be hopelessly behind and non-competitive almost every industry, so it can't be a broadband strategy; it has to be a social support strategy. ", "10601 The CRTC map, Alberta stands out, actually, and the government applied these new principles. It's what actually does in France, Singapore, around the world, and we look at it bringing new infrastructure capital to the table as opposed to old Telcom capital. ", "10602 So with those remarks, Mr. Chairman, I welcome your questions. ", "10603 THE CHAIRMAN: Well, thank you very much for as well following the hearing and adapting your comments to where we're at in that hearing. That's very much appreciated.", "10604 So I'll put you in the hands of Commissioner MacDonald, who will start us off.", "10605 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good morning, and thank you for being here. I think it's important that you're here because we really do want to draw on some of your experience, not just in Alberta but also around the world. ", "10606 And as I understand your proposal, it's similar to what you're doing in Alberta right now, so I just want to make sure I have a correct understanding.", "10607 So your end clients that you have today would be predominately public sector large enterprise or other carriers that you provide services to? You're not currently providing any residential services to individuals? ", "10608 MR. PRICE: We actually have two segments to the business. We look at the fibre infrastructure business as two pieces. The piece between the communities, we call that a community interconnect grid. Some people call it backhaul or IX. That, we've called the Alberta SuperNet and is partnership with the Government of Alberta. ", "10609 So that grid is the grid that extends to the schools or the hospitals within the community and is available to everybody else at a point of presence in every community. ", "10610 That's one grid, and that solves the distance dislocation issue because High Level, which is 200 miles north of Edmonton, looks like it's in Calgary or Edmonton. So that's the purpose of that community interconnect grid. And the government is a customer of it, so the school system is on a province-wide grid. The health system is on a province-wide grid, and so on. ", "10611 So that's called -- we call that the -- actually SuperNet. It's actually SuperNet Ltd. is the company that does that. ", "10612 And this other sector we do through a company called Axia Connect, it does fibre to the premise within the communities, and we're doing four of those right now. ", "10613 So this second one is fibre to the premise and the first is the interconnect grid. You can't do the fibre to the premise as an independent without the interconnect grid to get you back to the world.", "10614 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And maybe the answer is different, depending on which section of your company we're talking about, but what do you offer in the way of services? Is it a pure dark fibre play? Are you simply providing wave-length services? Have you lit the fibre and you're providing ethernet services directly to government or residential services directly to consumers or are you mainly concerned about the pipes? ", "10615 MR. PRICE: Well, we put the pipes in, but we provide services. We go up to the internet gateway level --- ", "10616 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. ", "10617 MR. PRICE: --- broadband, wavelengths. Fundamentally, we're willing to do dark fibre but the marketplace hasn\u2019t advanced to dark fibre, so we provide the end user a digital connection to the global gateways. ", "10618 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. ", "10619 MR. PRICE: Right. ", "10620 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that additional information. ", "10621 With respect to your submission, you noted that in this day and age, speeds anywhere from 25 megs to a gig download were what's needed in the marketplace.", "10622 Can you shed some light on how you come up with those numbers from your international experience, because we heard from Bell yesterday and other large ISPs and they definitely hold a different view of what speeds are required.", "10623 MR. PRICE: Yeah, so I think there's this word need, required, want, and long list of that. ", "10624 We go at it from a -- since we're only in fibre, so we only have fibre infrastructure, our fundamental difference in cost of 5 megs or 25 megs is not a big difference. That's the technology character of the fibre infrastructure. ", "10625 And 25 megs -- and when we talk megabits we're talking about synchronous up and down. We don\u2019t have a -- like, a download five and a upload one. A lot of our customers rely as much on the upload as the download. It\u2019s the residential video consumer that's on the download side, but industry is more on the upside. ", "10626 So all our business is synchronous. Twenty-five (25) up, 25 down is the lowest we offer in the residential SME business market. And then we take to a gigabit. ", "10627 And then on the interconnect grid, the wholesale offering, it -- we do sell smaller components so that the customer doesn\u2019t have to buy 25 megabits, so an ISP can buy one megabit from us. That's to enable the ISP to be more competitive because they can buy it at an increment. ", "10628 So what is the need? We would say, if you can get fibre infrastructure within the same monthly spend as the old copper infrastructure, then it should replace that old copper infrastructure because it's simply way better.", "10629 And so our company invests in that where we can see that work. If we can't see fibre working, it doesn\u2019t help us to reduce the megabit capacity because we're only in the fibre business in the first place.", "10630 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So at those speeds -- and you also suggest, you know limitless downloading caps and other aspects of a service like that, does that -- I mean, obviously the capabilities of fibre are limitless, but the same isn't always said about equipment. Upgrades need to happen to be able to force more information through the pipe. ", "10631 With that type of proposal at those speeds, unlimited usage, does that create any problems from a transport standpoint on your network, or would it create problems if it wasn\u2019t -- if you weren't supplying an all-fibre network, if you had satellite in your system or wireless technologies in your system?", "10632 MR. PRICE: Or some old copper? ", "10633 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Or some old copper?", "10634 MR. PRICE: Right. That particular attribute is because it's 100 percent fibre network and it's why the progressive countries around the world are saying, \"If I can get the fibre to replace the old copper, then I have all those advantages at no more cost.\" ", "10635 So the history of this debate has been the fibre is way more money. That's been the history of the Telco-Cableco debate. It's too expensive. Everybody can't afford it. ", "10636 I would just say the reality of that is, there's lots of markets where the fibre's no more money than their current ARPU that they charge on their old networks. ", "10637 And around the world, people are saying, \"How do I put a framework in so I can transform the old copper to fibre within the current ARPU spend of the customer? Because if I could deliver that dividend, why wouldn't I?\"", "10638 So we -- it starts with unbundling all those services that are part of the bundle. We don\u2019t sell telephone, we don\u2019t sell video, we don\u2019t sell TV or any of these things. We go right to the core basic fibre infrastructure and light it up for digital traffic. ", "10639 And our residential 25 megabit rate is $59 and our customers can buy that and add whatever else they choose to add to it and their bundle costs are less than the old bundles. That's why they switch to our service. ", "10640 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: With respect to the symmetrical service that you're suggesting -- and I understand that fibre can do that, and I certainly understand the advantages of a symmetrical services requirement for governments. It's a requirement for large enterprise, the MUSH sector. ", "10641 I understand the benefits that that provides, but is it overkill in a residential application? Like, what will the -- an individual consumer receive with full symmetrical service?", "10642 MR. PRICE: Well, if they run a photography business, they would way rather have symmetrical than not because they'd be uploading their video and photography, the whole world of local security and local surveillance, and as health care moves to in-home surveillance, all those are all upload. ", "10643 And if the symmetrical upload doesn\u2019t cost you materially, why not build it in so that all those future services are already taken care of? You\u2019re kind of future-proof. It isn\u2019t more expensive on a fibre network to have synchronous. In our view it\u2019s no more expensive. ", "10644 So since the future includes a whole bunch of surveillance type upload activities, not counting gaming and so on which is a big sector in the residential market, in the old topology, upload was fundamentally compromised technically; on a fibre grid it\u2019s not. So build it in.", "10645 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: While on the topic of building it, can you speak to the practicality of having an all-fibre everywhere network in a country the size of Canada with a population of about 35 million people? I don\u2019t know off the top of my head was spent on the SuperNet in Alberta. You can probably provide us with that figure. But is a full-scale fibre deployment across the country realistic in the median term or long term?", "10646 MR. PRICE: So we would that into two categories. The fibre grid between the communities, one category. Should everybody community be on fibre? Well, it\u2019s less money than putting in a road, power, water, sewer, and everything else. So somehow we have a view that a community should have running water, should have natural gas, should have power, and we build that into the cost of a community. We build the road to the community socially. The fibre is less than all that. ", "10647 So if that community wants to compete it should be on fibre. And it isn\u2019t that much money. Not that interconnect piece, which is just the piece between the communities. We did every community in Alberta for $250 million, right. That\u2019s what it took to do every community in Alberta. ", "10648 Now that isn\u2019t every resident in Alberta at all, right. So now that\u2019s the grid between the communities. What does that do? It turns loose the wireless guys and the fibre to the premise guys, so it\u2019s a combination of the two. You take the fibre as far as it can go economically and the wireless guys take over off the end of that fibre. ", "10649 The wireless guys are way more economic and high performing if they\u2019re backhauled on fibre than if they\u2019re on copper or wireless themselves. So that interconnect grid creates more competitive higher performing mobility, more competitive point-to-point wireless. That\u2019s what the interconnect does. And it also allows a community to elect whether to go fibre to their premise or not.", "10650 So I\u2019d say it starts with the community interconnect grid. We\u2019ve got that in Alberta; we did that. And that\u2019s why our point-to-point wireless guys are so much more competitive replacing copper than anywhere else in Canada. They have that fibre backhaul grid. ", "10651 The fibre to the premise piece, you let that work in the market under a framework that doesn\u2019t require financial support.", "10652 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So only the backhaul of the transport piece would require financial support and then let market forces deal with the service on a community-by-community basis?", "10653 MR. PRICE: Right, because the image is that community is 300 miles or kilometres north and small. How does it pay for the fibre from Edmonton to that community? Northwest Territories or Nunavut would be a good example too. How do you charge the local residents all that capital? You didn\u2019t charge them for the road, you didn\u2019t charge them for the power. You didn\u2019t charge them for it. Okay, put this in that category. ", "10654 The social infrastructure spending would be get the community on independent fibre, job one. That accomplished, set a framework which allows the fibre to the premise and the wireless guys to stretch broadband coverage as far as you can go without financial support. And it can go quite a ways if it has the first part.", "10655 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So since you\u2019re talking about it in a social infrastructure statement -- you\u2019re comparing it to roads, you\u2019re comparing it to water services -- I assume that you think that this should be -- or at least the transport component of this solution should be government funded?", "10656 MR. PRICE: Well, it will always -- to the extent that a community\u2019s rates won\u2019t support it, the gap should be government funded. ", "10657 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "10658 MR. PRICE: That\u2019s the transport interconnect fibre. ", "10659 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "10660 MR. PRICE: That allows that community, no matter where it is, to not be distance based away from technology. Now it\u2019s just a local access question not a long-distance question. ", "10661 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And would this, under your proposal, only be in areas of the country that are underserviced today? I assume government wouldn\u2019t be called upon to fund a fibre link between Toronto and Montreal when we know that the various service providers already have built those fibre links. ", "10662 MR. PRICE: (Inaudible) underserviced or not available to independents; I would add that.", "10663 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. ", "10664 MR. PRICE: Right? So if it\u2019s a proprietary fibre grid that\u2019s not available to independents it should be made available or, like, literally we built fibre links because otherwise the market wouldn\u2019t have access to them. ", "10665 Now that\u2019s a regulatory rate policy question, which you guys are tackling in another arena. So that\u2019s why I was saying if it\u2019s not available -- it doesn\u2019t help to say it exists if it\u2019s not available.", "10666 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. But if there was a service provider that, you know, through their carrier department was willing to sell service or sell connectivity between -- or dark fibre, whatever the platform is -- between communities then government support wouldn\u2019t be required to rebuild that link? ", "10667 MR. PRICE: I would say 99 times out of 100 if the fibre exists then it\u2019s not. No support is needed. It\u2019s where the fibre does not exist.", "10668 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Is there any concern -- and maybe you can speak to the Alberta experience -- of when you build it perhaps they don\u2019t come? What happens if the community is -- a link is built to a community and then there\u2019s no interest for whatever reason on the part of the public sector to continue to build out services to the (inaudible) perhaps based on the economic reality of the community or the size of the community; has that happened? Or is there any concern in that regard? ", "10669 MR. PRICE: We have not experienced building -- so there will always the sort of extreme example, right? Very small community and many hundreds of kilometers so, yeah, that\u2019s that extreme that you guys are dealing with all the time.", "10670 So what I\u2019m saying is in Alberta we haven\u2019t experienced it. We went to every community. If you take a community way up in the northeast over a whole bunch of muskeg we used microwave instead of fibre. For that community that microwave looks like fibre because that\u2019s the size of that community. So there is a way to get high performance digital connectivity. Normally it\u2019s fibre. Certain circumstances you might use microwave. ", "10671 The key question is does the end user have access to it at rates that are like postage stamp rates? I may be in High Level but it looks like I\u2019m in Edmonton. Then the whole application and end-use world works. ", "10672 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: All right.", "10673 MR. PRICE: That\u2019s a rate card and a capacity question, which normally is covered by fibre, sometimes covered by wireless.", "10674 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. So since you\u2019re suggesting an open-access network obviously whoever manages that would have an obligation to provide connectivity to any ISP that wanted to go into that market and provide service. ", "10675 But if they\u2019re ultimately riding on the government-funded government-built network and are availing of the benefits of that, should the end service provider that wants to go into the small community in rural Alberta -- should they carry with them any type of obligation to serve all of the residents in that community if they are -- if that service provider is benefiting from government investment to provide that connectivity to the community?", "10676 MR. PRICE: Well, that service provider is investing his own money in an economic framework. So the business model we use in Alberta, and it\u2019s the same one in France and elsewhere we use, we create a marketplace that we want to function and it\u2019s the economics of the marketplace that works for them. ", "10677 If you superimpose an obligation on them and that obligation is an uneconomic one, from their point of view, you lose the attractiveness of them chasing the market.", "10678 So none of our guys would turn down customers within their footprint. The economic drive is to get customers and the revenue. I wouldn\u2019t see -- we wouldn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t have the challenge of attaching an obligation. The obligation went with Axia to make this available at these rates. The obligation to the marketplace is take advantage of it in a competitive environment; right? They haven\u2019t got a franchise. They have no rights. They just have a competitive market to compete in.", "10679 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay. Are there any best practices that you can take away from the Alberta example or the dos and the don\u2019ts as to how such funding should be provided and how the relationship should be managed between the government that\u2019s funding this and the organization that\u2019s in charge of managing it?", "10680 MR. PRICE: Okay. So the \u201cit\u201d let me just pull apart into these two pieces again. There\u2019s the community interconnect job, which is interconnecting all these communities and getting them on to a fibre grid at a rate card that does not depend on size or distance; right? Take size of the community away, take distance of the community away and get them access to a fibre grid rate card.", "10681 I would say the Alberta -- and that\u2019s the interconnect grid part. The best practices, we pretty much nailed it for that purpose. We solved that.", "10682 The next question is, what do you do off the end of it? We turned loose a wireless marketplace. What\u2019s the best practice in that? The person that has the interconnect grid should not be in wireless competing with our customers. So Axia doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s just Axia\u2019s best practice.", "10683 We\u2019re not in the wireless sector. The wireless sector is our customer. And that creates a functional marketplace in the wireless connectivity. So that\u2019s good.", "10684 That sector never got any sustained funding. So from the government\u2019s policy point of view, they didn\u2019t sign on to a liability, a perpetual liability in the future. And then what you find is, where do the marketplace parameters not work? Because it works for all those green dots, but there\u2019s places without green dots.", "10685 It allows the government to then say we\u2019ve gone as far as the market can go without perpetual subsidies. What do we do now? Maybe nothing, or maybe take additional step. But you don\u2019t have to do it before you take advantage of as far as the market can go without it. So from a taxpayer point of view, that was good.", "10686 What I would say has been complicated is all of this was done without really a regulatory framework that proposed it or sanctioned it. It\u2019s okay. Everything we\u2019re doing is okay. But we\u2019re always in the debate about where our regulations\u2019 going because we\u2019re kind of riding under the radar, so to speak, of the policy debates. So that ends up being a debate in its own right.", "10687 The other thing I would say is it\u2019s very hard for this structure to have perpetual character; right? Because it\u2019s a specialized structure. If it\u2019s not under our regulatory framework, it then is under our contractual framework that needs to be reviewed because it\u2019ll have a time attached to it.", "10688 So I\u2019d say the -- and that\u2019s the other thing we\u2019re talking to is not an intervention or regulatory framework, but a framework that recognizes if you do things in this way that the future regulatory framework will respect it.", "10689 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Have there been any complications created because in some aspect it\u2019s government money being used to create a new monopoly in the province, at least with respect to transport services. Has that created some complications? Or is that all handled through the -- your interactions with the government and the rates you can charge to service providers?", "10690 MR. PRICE: Right. So it\u2019s not just government money. So --", "10691 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Yeah.", "10692 MR. PRICE: -- there is government money but not just government money. And there is government money in every telco and every cableco. Even though they like to say there isn\u2019t, there is.", "10693 So the way it\u2019s handled given it\u2019s not under the regulatory framework, our regulatory framework is our contractual obligations to our partner, the Government of Alberta. And that\u2019s handled by open access, rate cards and everybody has access to it. That\u2019s our obligation and that\u2019s what we do.", "10694 So I would say obviously there\u2019s always a debate because competing commercial interests are always debating leverage and advantages and disadvantages. It is the right answer, but it\u2019s not without the debate because there is the other debate; right?", "10695 But everybody has equal access to it. The government funding literally reduced the rates and made it viable. The government funding did not go into Axia\u2019s pocket. Didn\u2019t even go there. It reduced the rates on the cost of this infrastructure for the benefit of the end users.", "10696 And when it\u2019s that focussed, you know that happens. That\u2019s the advantage of not being conflicted with other parts of the bundle. ", "10697 Like you guys have a huge challenge, in my mind, sorting between all these different issues when the party in front of you is in everything. And it is crystal clear to us everywhere we go that the policy framework makes so much more sense when the party doing this part of the business, this infrastructure part of the business, is only doing that. There is no other charges, priorities, intercompany charges don\u2019t exist if you\u2019re only in that business.", "10698 And around the world, that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s doing because their regulators told the government there\u2019s no way for us to properly regulate this new web world integrated with the media world integrated with the telephone world. If you want us to regulate it, we got to get to a single purpose focussed infrastructure space and then let these other guys compete in the market.", "10699 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: In your proposal and I want to make sure I\u2019m understanding this correctly, you\u2019re suggesting that once this is built, once this is set up, that regulations would prohibit other parties from going in and building their own fibre transport or tower infrastructure? Am I reading that correctly?", "10700 MR. PRICE: Okay. So if you look at this from a point of view of infrastructure and the cost of that infrastructure to be amortized over a market, then the logical thing is amortize it over the whole market so that it\u2019s the lowest cost infrastructure.", "10701 As soon as you subdivide that market it\u2019s not infrastructure anymore. It\u2019s a proprietary asset and now you have two proprietary assets competing with each other sort of, maybe. And the market has to pay for both of them.", "10702 So the parties that -- when it\u2019s in a regulatory framework that makes it infrastructure, it\u2019s not so much prohibiting it as not funding the competing infrastructure, not supporting the competing infrastructure; right?", "10703 The idea -- it\u2019s the only industry I\u2019ve ever heard of infrastructure based competition is the telco industry. There are no others. Because those two things are oxymorons. Infrastructure, competition, they don\u2019t go together.", "10704 Infrastructure is to be shared, low cost, one. And competition is multiple, competing, proprietary. Around the world they may not take the view that you can\u2019t, they just don\u2019t support it. ", "10705 So it\u2019s more like taking us literally there, if a small town wanted the best chance at infrastructure, you would limit the infrastructure to one party. You\u2019d make them compete to offer it at the best price. And then you would agree that the market would use it. That\u2019s what you would agree. That will get the end user the best price is agreeing that the market would use it.", "10706 Who\u2019s against that? Who\u2019s against that concept? It\u2019s only the legacy telco, cableco. They\u2019re the only ones against it. So that\u2019s what I mean by subordinating that interest to the customer\u2019s interest.", "10707 If you want to be refined and at the limit, you would say five years after that, since the telco has the opportunity to use that fibre and, after all, the Telco builds its own fibre in the big cities so they recognize the copper\u2019s not good enough there so -- and they turn off the copper in their big city, so why isn\u2019t that copper turned off when that fibre is better?", "10708 Like, in Alberta I\u2019d say turn off the coal generating plant. Why? It\u2019s old, outdated technology; natural gas is better and it\u2019s free and it\u2019s there. So this would be that. Whether the regulator chooses to do it or not is, I would call it, fine tuning. ", "10709 It\u2019s not mandatory but if the regulator did, the cost of that infrastructure would be lower to the end user in that market because the investor would say, \u201cI will have 80 percent adoption instead of 60 and I can amortize that infrastructure over a bigger market so I\u2019ll charge less money.\u201d That would be the outcome if you did.", "10710 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: And I take the point that it makes more sense to build one highway going into a community if that one highway can support all of the residents. But just I\u2019m clear, you\u2019re suggesting that if a provider did want to go in and build that highway into the community they could if they wanted to; it just couldn\u2019t be funded through the program so it would be on ---", "10711 MR. PRICE: Yeah.", "10712 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay.", "10713 MR. PRICE: Sure.", "10714 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: So we\u2019re not talking about prohibiting investments on the part of the providers and the spinoff benefits that those investments may create ---", "10715 MR. PRICE: No.", "10716 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: --- by building the highway a second time?", "10717 MR. PRICE: No.", "10718 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay.", "10719 Just a couple more questions before I hand you back over to my colleagues. You suggest a pilot; that makes good sense. You suggest it happen in Alberta and I\u2019m just wondering why you chose Alberta because Alberta is relatively well served in comparison to other regions of the country. So what was the rationale for choosing Alberta versus Nunavut, for example?", "10720 MR. PRICE: Well, there\u2019s two things. The pilot we\u2019re talking about is for the fibre to the premise within the community, that infrastructure framework. The reason we can do it in Alberta is because we have the interconnect grid already. So you can do it anywhere in Alberta; you don\u2019t have to look for where the fibre interconnects the community in the first place, that other spend that has already been done in Alberta by the partnership between the Alberta Government and Axia.", "10721 So you can see how the fibre to the premise local access piece works in Alberta; we\u2019re already doing it, just not under a sanctioned regulatory framework, so to speak. ", "10722 Secondly, well, we\u2019re from Alberta; we\u2019re already operating there. So -- and you have other pilots you have going on in Ontario and Quebec and that isn\u2019t in Alberta so we would say include Alberta in a pilot for this purpose. If you want to go further than that, that would make sense, too.", "10723 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Just one final question -- and this may tie back to your relationship and experience with the Alberta partnership but what\u2019s done from a government standpoint because they did provide, to your point, not all of the funding but some of the funding. What does the government do, or what do the contracts state, around quality of service and mean-time to repair, and aspects like that that you must provide for over the course of the contract term? Does the government monitor it or report on it, for example?", "10724 MR. PRICE: We monitor it and we report on it to the government.", "10725 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay.", "10726 MR. PRICE: And the class of service/quality of service issues -- because this was done back when the internet was still being even debated and the carriers were trying not to do the internet, we started with a visionary-type set of objectives which has carried on.", "10727 Axia fundamentally is competing to get people on the network; nobody committed to come to the network. So all our QOS -- we lead the industry in QOS, mean-time to repair and so on because we are competing to get the business on the network against the Telco, Cableco Networks.", "10728 So I will be happy to give you what are current NTRs and latency, jitter and packet loss rules are but they always are evolving from a competitive point of view.", "10729 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay, I think that would be helpful if you can maybe file that as an undertaking ---", "10730 MR. PRICE: Sure.", "10731 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: --- by May the 5th.", "10732 MR. PRICE: Sure.", "10733 ", "UNDERTAKING ", "10734 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: That would be appreciated. And those are my questions.", "10735 MR. PRICE: Thank you.", "10736 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Thanks.", "10737 THE CHAIRMAN: Thank you.", "10738 Commissioner Vennard?", "10739 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good morning, Mr. Price.", "10740 MR. PRICE: Good morning.", "10741 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: I have a couple of questions for you. The first thing I\u2019d like you to address is the question of a subsidy on your model. And I\u2019m wondering if you could -- if you could explain to us for our record what the subsidy model in France is that I think is pretty much the same model.", "10742 In taking apart the various pieces, then, that also allows subsidy to be quite targeted to certain areas as well. And I\u2019m wondering if you could again, for the purposes of our record, just explain to us.", "10743 MR. PRICE: Sure. So France has a similar challenge to Canada in the sense that it\u2019s a big country, not nearly as big as Canada but big in Europe and small places, big places, the challenge of remote little -- you know, in their world they call it remote and I call it not so remote, but it still has all that dynamic. ", "10744 So what the government did is they set a framework of national regulatory framework saying, \u201cThe copper\u2019s not good enough; we\u2019re going to move to fibre; and they way we\u2019ll move to fibre is we\u2019ll create a framework under which people can propose fibre in a local region, a town, a department.\u201d As long as they follow this criteria, then they -- in France they qualify for funding financial support.", "10745 The industry bids the outcomes. So we bid the rates of access to this infrastructure. We bid the coverage of it. It\u2019s all fibre. There\u2019s the fibre map; there\u2019s the coverage; you drew a circle around this saying, \u201cThis department wants fibre here.\u201d We bid a rate -- we don\u2019t bid the rate; the government basically tells us the rate they want as an outcome. ", "10746 So in your context I\u2019ll use fibre to their premise in France is 13 euros a month is an outcome they want; and that outcome they want no matter where you\u2019re bidding. So their policy decision was, \u201cI want this outcome.\u201d ", "10747 And then the constraints are we\u2019ve got to put a physical asset in; it\u2019s going to take X dollars. How much financial support do we need to deliver that rate? So the competition is around the financial support necessary to deliver the rate.", "10748 And sometimes you don\u2019t need financial support. And if you bid -- if somebody says, \u201cI don\u2019t need it\u201d and the other guy says, \u201cI need 10 percent,\u201d the guy that needs 10 percent doesn\u2019t win. The guy that says, \u201cI can do it without financial support\u201d wins.", "10749 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So in that sort of model, then, a region, a community, an area, they could go together if they wanted? Say there were 10 or 12 communities that decided that they wanted to come together and that they would -- they wanted a particular outcome, the residents decided they wanted to, you know, spend 12 euros. And then they would put that out? Is that ---", "10750 MR. PRICE: Actually, the Government of France has said 12 euros.", "10751 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so that is set by ---", "10752 MR. PRICE: For everybody.", "10753 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "10754 MR. PRICE: If you\u2019re going to do it this way, the infrastructure party has to bid 12 euros ---", "10755 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "10756 MR. PRICE: --- and then the government will allow -- will provide financial support to make up this gap if it actually costs more than 12 euros. Right?", "10757 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "10758 MR. PRICE: So they get a standard rate card. We\u2019re in 28 regions in France, some as big as the City of Calgary or bigger. We\u2019re in 28 regions in France; they\u2019re all on the same rate card.", "10759 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay.", "10760 MR. PRICE: Our rate card is the same everywhere whether it\u2019s way south of France, Bretagne, it doesn\u2019t matter.", "10761 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay.", "10762 MR. PRICE: But the amount of financial support varies. And what triggers it is the ground up. The local community says, \u201cI want this fibre infrastructure.\u201d They don\u2019t have to do it.", "10763 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: Okay.", "10764 MR. PRICE: It\u2019s not like a minimum \u201cYou have to do it.\u201d It\u2019s a fiscal program that says, \u201cIf you want to at the local government level have this fibre infrastructure, then do it under this framework and you can qualify for financial support at the national level.\u201d", "10765 CHAIRPERSON MacDONALD: So other providers then would be free to go into the area as well and do what they want, and if they assumed that there was going to be customers for their product and ---", "10766 MR. PRICE: Other fibre providers?", "10767 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, or wireless, or just other providers of ---", "10768 MR. PRICE: Well, what happens is somebody wins this fibre footprint ---", "10769 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "10770 MR. PRICE: --- and that doesn\u2019t prohibit other people from investing in fibre. But this one got the financial support and is ubiquitous. ", "10771 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "10772 MR. PRICE: And the reality is it\u2019s better than every other answer.", "10773 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Right.", "10774 MR. PRICE: So when we do this Orange, France Telecom, and Americable there are customers on these grids.", "10775 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "10776 MR. PRICE: As well as the independents. And the strength of it is it\u2019s the new guys that drive it. The old guys don\u2019t drive it. They have to compete with the new guys.", "10777 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And that\u2019s what you were referring to before when you were talking about bringing other people, opening the market up to the competition ---", "10778 MR. PRICE: Yes.", "10779 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- from some new players? Okay. ", "10780 MR. PRICE: Because otherwise the incumbents say I have this cash flow, I have my dividend growth obligations, I have my priorities for mobility and the raptors or whoever, and down here is discretionary fibre money.", "10781 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "10782 MR. PRICE: And you open up the market to the capital markets and the capital markets will bet fibre infrastructure money under a framework. And then we come and say, well, I\u2019ll use that infrastructure because it\u2019s more economic than me doing it and it\u2019s there. So the question is how do you get that framework going?", "10783 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. And then that player just plays in their yard and ---", "10784 MR. PRICE: That\u2019s it. They aren\u2019t allowed to be in the other stuff.", "10785 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, okay.", "10786 MR. PRICE: They\u2019re not in pay-per-view, or telephone, or sports, or anything else.", "10787 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Another question that I have for you is how do you see this as being -- do you see this as being scalable to a national level to your model? Would that be increased, you know, sort of puffed up to include the whole entire country? Or do you see that as being a series of provincial initiatives, or how do you see that working?", "10788 MR. PRICE: Well, I think the strength of it not mandating the requirement to do it because that turns loose a whole bunch of government obligations to fund, right. The strength of it is the other way we\u2019ll create the framework and then we\u2019ll see who\u2019s willing to invest.", "10789 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Right.", "10790 MR. PRICE: Not see whether just the Telco and the cable co will invest, and have those negotiations.", "10791 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "10792 MR. PRICE: And end up with the Prime Minister and the media guys having to fight in the public, right.", "10793 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "10794 MR. PRICE: Let the new guys set the investment threshold in this infrastructure model and see where it pops up. Let it be ground up as opposed to top down.", "10795 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Top down.", "10796 MR. PRICE: Set up the framework. And if a town anywhere in the country says, \u201cI want to do that\u201d there\u2019s the framework. If you do it this way then we sanction that. See how many don\u2019t need any financial support at all.", "10797 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "10798 MR. PRICE: Right? Because our model in Alberta doesn\u2019t depend on financial support.", "10799 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "10800 MR. PRICE: We\u2019re doing it without.", "10801 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "10802 MR. PRICE: But you were saying France -- see, what France did is they said if there was no financial support it wouldn\u2019t be 12 euros; in some communities it would be 40 euros.", "10803 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "10804 MR. PRICE: So we want to level the playing field policy wise and we will make up the difference. We\u2019ll use the private sector to minimize the grants.", "10805 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "10806 MR. PRICE: Put up the capital and minimize the grants.", "10807 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Now those two things come together in my mind. I\u2019d like you to comment please on how well this model might work in the northern part of our country where we have, you know, extreme problems up there.", "10808 MR. PRICE: So my point here is there\u2019s one way to get the lowest cost on the table and then there\u2019s another way of how do you fund it? But if you don\u2019t get the lowest cost on the table you\u2019re perpetually funding something else. ", "10809 So any remote area first question is how do I get from that remote area to the world? That\u2019s that backhaul piece. I would say that should be common property. Someone should do it and make it available, and the government should write off the capital on it.", "10810 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you see it as a possibility for that -- and we\u2019ve heard that -- and here I\u2019m thinking of the satellite-dependent communities. So would you see an equivalency there in that transport piece of the satellite being equivalent to fibre and this model being able to be used or thought about in that way? ", "10811 So for example, if the government were to buy up pieces of the transport part and basically make an infrastructure of some kind, although clearly not fibre, but conceptually an infrastructure where this model could be used? ", "10812 MR. PRICE: I would say when the community is big enough and profile enough for whatever reason to have access for fibre why not?", "10813 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Why not? Yeah. ", "10814 MR. PRICE: Right? Because it\u2019s the homerun future proof thing. And of course it\u2019s a taxpayer question of how far that goes. But I would say take that as far as possible because then you\u2019re just down to this local access within the community issue.", "10815 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. ", "10816 MR. PRICE: And local access within a community doesn\u2019t look much different wherever that community is actually. Not local access within the community. Then there\u2019s the rancher that\u2019s not in the community, in the town.", "10817 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "10818 MR. PRICE: That\u2019s wireless or satellite. Satellite or terrestrial wireless.", "10819 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "10820 MR. PRICE: But take fibre as far as it can go. It\u2019s a 40-year future proof technology with no limitations on throughput. Just take it as far as you can make sense of it.", "10821 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So for example, in the Northwest Territories where there\u2019s the Mackenzie Valley Fibre project something like this could happen up there too because there\u2019s ---", "10822 MR. PRICE: As soon as the Mackenzie Valley Fibre project is in.", "10823 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "10824 MR. PRICE: If the party at the other end doesn\u2019t have to pay the capital of it, right, because if they have to guess what? ", "10825 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "10826 MR. PRICE: It\u2019s not even going to be competitive. ", "10827 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: It doesn\u2019t work.", "10828 MR. PRICE: It\u2019s not even economic, right?", "10829 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "10830 MR. PRICE: So somebody built that fibre. It would be government that funded that piece but then turn loose this other framework. Local access fibre on the ground is it economic in its own right? It\u2019s way more economic than people think if it isn\u2019t dependent on the incumbent Telco\u2019s backhaul.", "10831 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Right.", "10832 MR. PRICE: If that fibre backhaul is in somebody else\u2019s hands it\u2019s way more economic than people think.", "10833 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, well, thank you very much. Those are my questions.", "10834 MR. PRICE: Okay. ", "10835 THE CHAIRPERSON: Vice-Chair, Menzies?", "10836 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thanks. ", "10837 In order for this to work there would have to be some enthusiasm from provincial governments, would there not, in terms of that?", "10838 MR. PRICE: At least municipal or provincial.", "10839 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah. And I\u2019m just trying to get your sense of whether there actually is because I haven\u2019t really seen any. And it might be there and I\u2019m not aware of it, but any provincial initiatives for going back a few years now regarding buildouts they\u2019ve kind of left it to the federal governments. ", "10840 I mean, and there were about four provincial budgets in the last couple of weeks and I\u2019ve been too busy to dig into the documents but, I mean, Newfoundland doesn\u2019t have any money. Alberta is spending lots of money but I\u2019m not sure if they even targeted anything to, like, what they\u2019ve been thinking about completing the build of the SuperNet. And I\u2019m not sure about the other two.", "10841 So do you think there\u2019s the political or intellectual capital out there to move an idea like this forward anywhere but here?", "10842 MR. PRICE: In Alberta they already spent the money. SuperNet is already there. And ---", "10843 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And we\u2019re talking about finishing.", "10844 MR. PRICE: Yeah. But the fibre to the premise piece doesn\u2019t require any financial support period, right. Then you say how many -- let\u2019s say a third of the communities get fibre to the premise without any financial support because then economics just work. Why not take that dividend? It was free, it was there. At least they got through into the new world. Then people can say, \u201cWell, is it interesting to go any further and would it cost some money?\u201d ", "10845 But what we\u2019re actually proposing here is not financial support for fibre to the premise. We\u2019re saying a framework that allows a fibre to the premise investment, that investment status. No financial support, right? And what portion of the market do you get, let\u2019s call it from a public policy point of view, as a freebie? No support, no financial support. ", "10846 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I understand that. I was just trying to get a sense of whether anybody was buying what you\u2019re selling within government ---", "10847 MR. PRICE: End users are.", "10848 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Eh?", "10849 MR. PRICE: End users are.", "10850 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I know. Within government I was ---", "10851 MR. PRICE: I would say government in Alberta isn\u2019t on this topic because they think it\u2019s a national topic.", "10852 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "10853 MR. PRICE: Right? So there is this jurisdictional -- you know, why are you coming to me to talk about this policy? That\u2019s in the hands of the federal government, right?", "10854 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "10855 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "10856 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. I have questions about your access proposal but first I have some questions on transport.", "10857 I understand what you\u2019ve presented as the model. We\u2019re not beginning here. You know, I think one of the challenges is that there is a lot of the broadband network is built. There\u2019s a lot of fibre transport out there.", "10858 How do we go from where we are to where you would suggest?", "10859 I mean, right now, through this hearing, and the record, I\u2019m hearing some kind of confusing information about our transport network. Some have suggested there is discoverability issues with knowing where it is and what capacity is there. Some have suggested there are some issues around proprietary networks and whether you can get on or not. Some say it needs augmentation, some say it doesn\u2019t.", "10860 So I understand your model I\u2019m just trying to understand where you see us today and what might be the regulatory actions that are required to open up that transport, ensure it\u2019s full and available.", "10861 MR. PRICE: So the transport between the communities, that regulatory policy, I would say, from a third party user\u2019s point of view, is not functional, right. And we kind of proved that in Alberta, because when we put the other one in all those independent guys are customers of ours they\u2019re not customers of the old network.", "10862 So we put that -- so -- and we don\u2019t buy on -- we only buy wavelengths on other people\u2019s networks, so we get into an easily understandable transaction and that sort of spot we really only get access to wavelengths where the cableco is competing with the telco -- sorry, the cableco --- ", "10863 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So, just to understand, are you seeking access and you can\u2019t get access? Is that what you\u2019re saying to me?", "10864 MR. PRICE: On total -- on commercial terms that work and are functional in the market, adding all that, right, price, distance, market, commercial terms, willingness to sell ---", "10865 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But the goal here can\u2019t be to overbuild if it can be addressed in a more economical way for society.", "10866 MR. PRICE: For sure, but that means --- COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So -- yeah, okay, I\u2019ll let you go. Tell us ---", "10867 MR. PRICE: That does mean that ---", "10868 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Tell us what are the regulatory actions, if any, that would be required to ---", "10869 MR. PRICE: I would say the regulatory approach to access to incumbents fibre in Canada it\u2019s never been aggressive enough to make it functional as compared to these other jurisdictions where we have access to the incumbents\u2019 ducts at numbers that relate to the actual operating cost of the duct.", "10870 So if you want this to work then the incumbent can\u2019t be the one that\u2019s controlling the prices of access to their network. And I would say, on balance, that\u2019s what happens now. All in. By the time you\u2019re doing business with them terms and conditions, everything that goes on, you can\u2019t make a business competing with the incumbent using the incumbent\u2019s network, right.", "10871 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Is it your sense where there\u2019s duplicate transport facilities -- like is this issue where there\u2019s not competition in transport or ---", "10872 MR. PRICE: It\u2019s pretty much the way the incumbents do business.", "10873 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Even when there\u2019s two of them?", "10874 MR. PRICE: If there are two of them they\u2019re ---", "10875 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: They both do that?", "10876 MR. PRICE: One typically -- more typical than not the telco is less willing to do business than the cableco, more often than not, but the cableco has a smaller ---", "10877 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Have you ever come to the regulator in any way to seek access?", "10878 MR. PRICE: I know what the challenge is. The challenge is how much money and time can I spend to get access to a $2,000 a month wavelength.", "10879 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So then what do you do; do you build?", "10880 MR. PRICE: Well, if you\u2019re doing that all the time -- so in our world, Axia\u2019s world, whether it\u2019s in France or here, we aggregate our own backhaul network, we do not rent it. We can\u2019t make the business work renting it.", "10881 And from your point of view you have a big challenge setting those rates because it looks like they invested a lot of money in that network, right. ", "10882 In reality, we have our own backhaul network in France, we have our own backhaul network in Alberta, and that allows all the stuff on the end of it to be competitive, and that network is competing with the incumbent, and that\u2019s okay because now the incumbent is more competitive.", "10883 I would never try and build a business buying from the incumbent to compete with the incumbent. You\u2019re ---", "10884 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I understand if you\u2019re going into a new area, but all I\u2019m saying is from where we are today ---", "10885 MR. PRICE: M\u2019hm.", "10886 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I don\u2019t think you came here suggesting that we overbuild all transport under the super net model in Canada, right?", "10887 MR. PRICE: No.", "10888 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No, no. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of transport out there ---", "10889 MR. PRICE: So when we put the super net model together we bought fibre from the incumbents. We purchased it. We would never be able to rent it or buy services over it ---", "10890 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "10891 MR. PRICE: --- and still make it work. And I don\u2019t know how you could regulate it otherwise.", "10892 Now, that\u2019s the IX, right. That\u2019s the between the community distance based link. You still have distance based charges. They charge by distance. There is no community they can pay by distance, right. So you still have -- how far is that -- what range is that community in, what\u2019s the distance from where, and the rate card looks like this.", "10893 We don\u2019t differentiate pricing based on distance so we can\u2019t buy ---", "10894 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But the Alberta government helped you create that model.", "10895 MR. PRICE: The Alberta government helped them create their model, and so did the Canadian government help them create their model. None of these guys funded these networks with their own capital from day one, none of them. So everybody ---", "10896 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So do you have a recommendation for us in what we might do?", "10897 MR. PRICE: I would say on this -- on what is useful, frame the community interconnect grid, I think that\u2019s more provincial level thinking than national level thinking. You\u2019re doing your best to regulate ---", "10898 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: How can you -- that really confuses me, because if something might be national it would seem to me it would be the transport network that connects Canada.", "10899 MR. PRICE: Right. Okay, if -- you\u2019re either in the world you\u2019re in now or you get bold and say we will fund the creation of a nationwide interconnect grid, and the way we\u2019ll do it is we\u2019ll franchise somebody to buy from incumbents strands where they exist and build where they don\u2019t. That\u2019s what you actually do.", "10900 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So there is no way we can take advantage of the entire network that exists there today ---", "10901 MR. PRICE: I\u2019m just saying ---", "10902 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- and the proposal is to ---", "10903 MR. PRICE: There\u2019s ways but ---", "10904 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- abandon it to the incumbents and build new?", "10905 MR. PRICE: No, building new ---", "10906 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Is that ---", "10907 MR. PRICE: No, building new is building where it doesn\u2019t exist and buying where it does exist, but get it out of the incumbents\u2019 business model.", "10908 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I see.", "10909 MR. PRICE: Because as long as it\u2019s in their business model having access to it is their rate card, their structure, and the new world that\u2019s just wrong. That\u2019s the old world. The new world that\u2019s just wrong.", "10910 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "10911 MR. PRICE: So the right answer is don\u2019t overbuild, franchise that to be created ---", "10912 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Expropriate.", "10913 MR. PRICE: --- and -- no, don\u2019t even expropriate.", "10914 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No, I\u2019m kidding. I\u2019m kidding. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.", "10915 MR. PRICE: But, to be frank, you know, we did it in Alberta by buying from the incumbent when they knew we otherwise would build, and the incumbent sold us fibre, not all of it, six strands here, eight strands there. The power of fibre is that\u2019s enough. You don\u2019t need it all. ", "10916 So if the issue is franchised and there is going to be a national interconnect grid, the incumbents will come fighting and screaming because they\u2019re losing control of the backhaul grid that is their leverage in those markets. So they\u2019ll come screaming and -- but franchise it and then they will sell fibre to it if the party has the capacity to overbuild it. If the party hasn\u2019t got the capacity to overbuild it good they\u2019re still number one, the other guy is number two.", "10917 In Alberta we had to start overbuilding in order for them to sell us fibre. We had to prove to them we wanted to buy it, we were willing to pay for it, they didn\u2019t want to sell it until we started building, then they thought, you know, my fibre isn\u2019t going to be worth very much if it\u2019s overbuilt, so we bought it from them.", "10918 So they got the money, they got their shareholder capital back in spades, and now they just have to compete. Nobody expropriated anything.", "10919 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I shouldn\u2019t have used that word.", "10920 MR. PRICE: No, no, it\u2019s a fair word because that\u2019s what they argue is happening.", "10921 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "10922 On the issue of the access, your model for access being separated from the transport free up and unbundle it from the services, there would be nothing today that would prohibit a company with private capital from doing that, correct?", "10923 MR. PRICE: That\u2019s true, right. Yeah. So we voluntarily do it in Alberta.", "10924 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And you said you were doing that in four communities?", "10925 MR. PRICE: With four in the last year, yeah.", "10926 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And so the model is working?", "10927 MR. PRICE: Well, we\u2019re ahead of schedule on adoption but we\u2019re not finished yet. We just started but we\u2019re ahead of all our plans on adoption. ", "10928 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Did you say you voluntarily do it?", "10929 MR. PRICE: Yeah. We don\u2019t have a regulatory requirement to do it.", "10930 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, of course not because ---", "10931 MR. PRICE: We set up our business framework.", "10932 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Because you\u2019re taking advantage of the business opportunity to build fibre to the prem in these communities that are ---", "10933 MR. PRICE: And it is within your regulatory framework for us to do that. It\u2019s just that ---", "10934 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Exactly. And that\u2019s really what I was going to ask, like, is there something that would prohibit this model from going forward today?", "10935 MR. PRICE: It will go forward on a certain pace today. What I\u2019m saying is if a framework sanctioned it, let\u2019s say formally, then every time we have a discussion provincially or locally when they say, \u201cWell, the regulator doesn\u2019t say this makes sense\u201d and the regulator\u2019s having hearings about how they\u2019re going to regulate this stuff in this future. So how do we know that this even works? ", "10936 And we say, well, it does work because we did it in Vulcan, and we did it in Nanton, and we\u2019re doing it in Barnwell, and we\u2019re doing it in Nobleford. But when they look for a regulatory understanding it\u2019s kind of just not stated, right? It\u2019s fine. We\u2019re totally legal in everything else. ", "10937 If you sanctioned it then the shareholder capital would say that\u2019s a sanctioned regulatory framework that will last, as opposed to us right now betting that it will last.", "10938 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Are you building or are you operational in any of those communities?", "10939 MR. PRICE: We\u2019re operational in three and building in another. ", "10940 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And who is offering services over your network?", "10941 MR. PRICE: Right now it\u2019s just us. We offer an internet service. And it\u2019s because of the size of the scale of this. It\u2019s not because the incumbents aren\u2019t eligible; they aren\u2019t interested.", "10942 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you.", "10943 Thank you, those are my questions.", "10944 THE CHAIRPERSON: In the exchange you were having moments ago about the transport group with Commissioner Molnar and you said, I think, we have to get the incumbents out of that whole business. That we have to think differently going forward. How different is that from what the Australians did?", "10945 MR. PRICE: The Australians have done everything as long as they had Telestar\u2019s agreement. ", "10946 THE CHAIRPERSON: But at one point they stopped agreeing trying Telestar\u2019s agreement and took it over, right?", "10947 MR. PRICE: They took it over as a national Crown corporation which still had to have Telestar\u2019s agreement.", "10948 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, so you\u2019re talking about something different than that?", "10949 MR. PRICE: What we\u2019re saying here is get -- you can\u2019t change the business practices of those companies. That would be a herculean task. So identify the new investment critical assets and put them in a framework, not transform the old framework.", "10950 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "10951 MR. PRICE: Too hard to do. It\u2019s there, a bunch of things have happened. My point is that old copper is irrelevant now in a futuristic now. It\u2019s not irrelevant in your world but it is irrelevant. It\u2019s fibre plus wireless so how do you -- since the fibre is not there, the fibre I\u2019m talking about doesn\u2019t exist right now. You can create a framework for that fibre that does not exist. It\u2019s not interfering on anybody because it doesn\u2019t exist.", "10952 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "10953 MR. PRICE: Create that framework. Whoever invests in that fibre infrastructure under that framework is within your framework. ", "10954 Right now everybody argues over access to fibre, access to local access fibre, access to backhaul fibre, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s in the old world. And I know there\u2019s a bunch over there but there\u2019s very little fibre to the premise actually there. ", "10955 And the future is fibre premise plus wireless. Wireless isn\u2019t in that old framework so that\u2019s good. Only fixed wireline is in the old framework. So get the new fibre infrastructure under a new regulatory framework going forward.", "10956 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Earlier you said there\u2019s public money in every tel co; can you unpack that for me?", "10957 MR. PRICE: The regulatory framework takes money out of my pocket and puts it in somebody else\u2019s pocket under that tel co framework. ", "10958 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, so you\u2019re including public money in terms of subscriber money, not just public tax money?", "10959 MR. PRICE: Regulatory transfer of money.", "10960 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, right. I get that.", "10961 Describe the situation in other jurisdictions. I just want to be clear in my mind. In Alberta do the incumbents like Shaw and TELUS use the SuperNet?", "10962 MR. PRICE: TELUS some, Shaw more. Not big customers. Logically they\u2019d use their own network.", "10963 THE CHAIRPERSON: To what extent then?", "10964 MR. PRICE: TELUS buys wavelengths from us in remote Northern Alberta where they don\u2019t have fibre. Shaw buys wavelengths from us in places which enhance their network. Both of those are logical decisions.", "10965 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "10966 MR. PRICE: Right. They have their own network. I\u2019d do the same; use your own network first. Now, where is it that can I add to my network more economically than building? And Shaw and TELUS do that. ", "10967 THE CHAIRPERSON: So after having built their own backbone they will extend a little bit ---", "10968 MR. PRICE: Well, they will first go to Ottawa and see whether they can get more money to add to their own backbone.", "10969 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "10970 MR. PRICE: Because that\u2019s still theirs. And only after the answer is no do they come to us.", "10971 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. There have been the suggestion -- speaking of going to Ottawa for money, perhaps in a different sense -- there have been some suggestion of accelerated capital cost allowance being something that we -- well, we don\u2019t do that obviously but we could recommend others to do that. What is your view on that?", "10972 MR. PRICE: I would say that\u2019s an enhancement to the incumbent cash flow. It\u2019s not available to the industry.", "10973 THE CHAIRPERSON: And you don\u2019t ---", "10974 MR. PRICE: Because that ---", "10975 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- therefore?", "10976 MR. PRICE: I just say a tax credit to us. When we\u2019re going to a new community we have no taxable benefit there.", "10977 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "10978 MR. PRICE: The incumbent has his long history of revenue expenses and taxes and so on. A tax credit to them is a grant.", "10979 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "10980 MR. PRICE: So tax credits favour the guy that\u2019s already there with taxes and are against the guy that\u2019s investing new capital.", "10981 THE CHAIRPERSON: And a CCA accelerated is only, in your view, a cash flow issue and there is no need for cash flow?", "10982 MR. PRICE: I would say it\u2019s helpful CCA acceleration, but the nature of the business is actually a long-term investment.", "10983 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "10984 MR. PRICE: And it would be better to line it up with long-term capital, and accelerated tax write off as opposed to tax credit. If it was only against the new asset -- but you see they never work against just the new asset, they work against the corporate profile.", "10985 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "10986 MR. PRICE: And so you write it off against other income. It\u2019s way more valuable to the guy that has a whole bunch of current taxable income than the guy who doesn\u2019t.", "10987 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you go so far as to propose accelerated CCA is not actually from an economic perspective neutral and efficient because the capital structure is -- the historic position of incumbents perhaps get an advantage?", "10988 MR. PRICE: I would say in a regulated franchised industry that\u2019s true. You\u2019re the new guy and you\u2019re competing with the regulated franchise guy.", "10989 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, that was the extent of my tax knowledge so perhaps we should stop at this point.", "10990 Okay, thank you very much. I believe those are our questions from the Panel. Thank you very much for having participated. ", "10991 And we will take a break. I have to do math now. That\u2019s too soon.

I'll be asking questions in English and feel free to answer in whatever language you choose. ", "11032 MR. RAMSAY: Yes. ", "11033 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you've made one very clear point about the printed directory and I'll get to that in a second. I just want to go back first to -- I think it's your second slide on terminology?", "11034 MR. RAMSAY: Yes. ", "11035 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: On that slide, in the speaking notes you provided, you make a comment that the broader Canadian regulatory framework applicable to directories generally is difficult to understand and should be clarified. ", "11036 Could you clarify for me --- ", "11037 MR. RAMSAY: Yes, absolutely.", "11038 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- what you meant there?", "11039 MR. RAMSAY: Yeah, absolutely. ", "11040 So I guess we are all clear that as far as residential directories are concerned, there is a discussion relative to entitlement. So basically, it's delivery on demand, if you will. That's the applicable regulatory regime as it applies to that. ", "11041 Relative to Yellow Pages, and in both the classified section as well as in the alphabetical section of business listings, there remains a requirement for mass distribution as part of the regulation, so that's the current framework. ", "11042 So basically there is a more onerous requirement for mass distribution of business directories, if you will, compared to residential directories, which are only required to be delivered on demand. ", "11043 Is there -- does this --- ", "11044 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I'm going to take that back just to clarify with our folks. ", "11045 MR. RAMSAY: Okay. ", "11046 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, so at this point then, it is not on demand as you understand it for business listings? ", "11047 MR. RAMSAY: For -- well, our current understanding of the regulation is that mass distribution is still required for Yellow Pages. ", "11048 Yeah, maybe, Sunny?", "11049 MR. HANDA: Permit me to -- well, perhaps attempt to clarify further. ", "11050 So if you divide the two directory types into two distinct buckets -- one residential, which we'll call White Pages, and the other, the business pages, which we will call Yellow Pages, the current framework is that White Pages are on demand, so if a consumer or customer of an ILEC, for example, would want them, they could phone or otherwise go on the Web and ask for the delivery of these things. But the Yellow Pages are delivered to everybody's -- everyone who's got a phone listing. We're talking about printed copies.", "11051 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: A printed copy of Yellow Pages --- ", "11052 MR. HANDA: Yes, correct, and --- ", "11053 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- as you understand, is required to be delivered --- ", "11054 MR. HANDA: Correct.", "11055 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- to everyone? ", "11056 MR. HANDA: Correct. Now, there's been some confusion in terms of nomenclature that's been used through various CRTC pronouncements over the years and if you sort of track them back, different words have been used: residential, White, Yellow, business, and the current proceeding uses the term \"local directories\". ", "11057 And so that's why that slide was inserted there, just to make sure that we had an opportunity to clarify what we believe the rules are currently or how they're currently structured. ", "11058 But it's slightly fragmented, and if the Commission goes through the various decisions and exchanges of letters and pronouncements over the years, we believe that you'll come to the same conclusion, that it is White that is on demand and Yellow business, which goes to everybody and is mass distributed. ", "11059 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, thank you for that. I was trying to understand that because it had been my understanding that directories were available on demand, and that's not your understanding and I'll accept you\u2019ve done more homework, I suppose.", "11060 So if it was to be harmonized that it was both -- that it was all listings available, a printed copy of all listings available on demand, would that go a long way to addressing your concerns as it relates to print? ", "11061 MR. RAMSAY: Well, you know, the current context of these hearings is about, you know, providing access to Canadians to broadband, if you will. And you know, I think the understanding that we have is that the majority of people looking for local information is already online. So it would seem to us that it would only be consistent with how society has evolved, if you will, that this requirement may be made to mirror what is actually the behaviour of a majority of people out there. ", "11062 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And one would think, given that the directory is available on demand, if it wasn\u2019t a requirement of the consumer, they wouldn't demand it. ", "11063 So I'm just asking, if we were to clarify or otherwise change a requirement that mandated delivery of the Yellow Pages, and in fact, the only requirement was to deliver a print copy on demand, would that remove a lot of your concern as it relates to the carbon footprint and having citizens, consumers, angry to actually have been delivered a copy that they weren't expecting?", "11064 MR. RAMSAY: Well, actually, substantial effort is devoted to actually preparing, manufacturing, and then afterwards, organizing for distribution of print directories. ", "11065 So obviously, in the historical context of print directories, economies of scale, if you will, were used to leverage, if you will, the -- you know, the whole system as it existed and as it stood.", "11066 So you know, to be very candid, I think in the current context, we think that that framework, where there would still be on-demand print directories available, it would appear to us to be inconsistent when -- with where the market is going. It would seem to us that it would be out of synch, if you will, relative to where, you know, the, you know, Canadians are -- have already gone, if you will. ", "11067 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, fair enough. And I do understand well that the outcome you would most desire would be no requirement to print? ", "11068 MR. RAMSAY: Well, the result that we think we've put forward is the best result. We think that the notion of entitlement needs to remain. We think this entitlement needs to be a digital entitlement to a listing information.", "11069 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, I have just one more question.", "11070 One of the challenges that exists in some of the issues we're speaking of here is not just access to broadband, as we make, you know, in a new broadband world, but also adoption. ", "11071 And right now there's approximately 18 percent of the population who have yet to adopt broadband as -- and you know --- ", "11072 MR. RAMSAY: M'hm. ", "11073 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- and the internet. So what would you see to be the strategy to ensure that they continue to have access to listing information? ", "11074 MR. RAMSAY: Well, what I would tell you is that, you know, I've been working at Yellow Pages since 2003, and as I was speaking with people before, you know, we've seen an evolution of our practices relative to where the market was, you know, at if you will. And so I would suggest that we have not been necessarily on many of these items ahead of where the market was, but we\u2019ve been following the evolution of the market. ", "11075 If you think about back in 2005, we introduced bi-annual distribution for, you know, residential directories, white pages if you will, because we felt that, you know, Canadians were no longer requiring, you know, residential directories on a yearly basis. And so we did that between 2005 until 2010. And in 2010 we introduced on-demand for white pages, if you will, only. ", "11076 In 2015 what we did is we thought that, you know, Canadians were ready because of the information we have based on surveys that have been conducted on our behalf in areas where the print yellow pages were no longer being used. We said let\u2019s put the yellow pages in distribution boxes and see if this method of distribution better reflects the habits and expectations of Canadians at that time. ", "11077 So and actually it\u2019s proven a fairly good success. There have not been complaints, to our knowledge, relative to people not, you know, receiving the books that they wanted to receive in that context. ", "11078 So I think it\u2019s been our strategy, and it\u2019s certainly been our view that we needed to evolve in how we address market needs based on, you know, what the information that we got from the market in that context. So that\u2019s really how we see the evolution of all of this is kind of following on where the market is going, recognizing that in the context of this hearing. ", "11079 These hearings don\u2019t happen, you know, that often and so we need to think about how the market is going to evolve. And we think the direction in which the market is going. We\u2019re not going to go back to where things were as far as print is concerned, clearly. ", "11080 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: What do you mean by distribution boxes?", "11081 MR. RAMSAY: So what we\u2019ve done in Oakville, for instance, in the Toronto market is we\u2019ve put boxes, distribution boxes that oftentimes are used to distribute for instance magazines or newspapers. We\u2019ve put boxes where people could actually pick up a copy of the yellow pages. And so we\u2019ve done actually quite a few of these boxes in the Toronto market. ", "11082 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. And are you saying that\u2019s what you would continue to do?", "11083 MR. RAMSAY: Well, I guess what I\u2019m saying is we are monitoring the evolution of trends, of how people use this information and consume this information. And we are keeping in tune with how markets require those kinds of information. Yes, so we\u2019ll continue to do that as long as we see that it\u2019s a useful way for Canadians to get that information.", "11084 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. Those are my questions. And I will -- certainly we will take back clarity around this requirement to deliver a business listing to every consumer. Thank you.", "11086 MR. HANDA: We\u2019ll be happy to, yes.", "11087 ", " UNDERTAKING", "11127 THE SECRETARY: We will now connect by Skype. ", "11128 We will now hear the presentation of Harewaves Wireless Inc.

I\u2019m the owner and operator of Harewaves Wireless Inc. We are a small DSL and fixed wireless ISP in rural Alberta. I thank you for the opportunity to express some of our views and concerns. ", "11130 This hearing has really broadened my awareness of the challenges out there in other areas. I\u2019m feeling fortunate about the advantages that Alberta has with our provincial government fibre back home. ", "11131 I think the recently published map by the Commission identifies that advantage, but the advantage does not come without its own challenges. The lack of available licence wireless spectrum is a huge problem and although it\u2019s not part of a mandate of this Commission, it is something that needs to be considered. ", "11132 The emergency of video-on-demand application in the recent years has proposed a unique challenge for small service providers. ", "11133 A few years ago, it was a straightforward solution to providing basic telecommunications. There was sufficient wireless frequency to provide what consumers were demanding. With the exponential growth of video-on-demand, service providers are finding it more difficult to deliver with the consumer\u2019s demand. ", "11134 Video on demand is saturating our networks and is eroding what we feel is a basic telecommunications. But what is basic telecommunications? ", "11135 I\u2019m sure in Nunavut, the description would be different than in central Alberta. Regardless of what that is defined as, we know that the more Internet access given, the more uses are found from that access. ", "11136 Regardless of what basic telecommunications are defined as, consumers are unhappy with their service if they cannot do what they want on the Internet. In the past eight years, our prices have remained the same, but our service offering of speed and data have increased 5- and 10-fold. This has a serious impact on return on investment and the feasibility of delivering service. ", "11137 Small providers have been doing the work in rural and remote areas for more than 10 years. We get pressure from the federal, provincial and especially municipal government to expand into more and more remote areas. ", "11138 We have been trying to figure out the best way to accomplish this for many years on a slim return on investment. Rural service providers generally have a huge personal investment in their operations and it is usually the livelihood of themselves and their employees. Small rural providers do not get enough credit. And if they disappeared, there would be a gap in rural Canada. ", "11139 Cellular providers have access to wireless spectrum that is out of reach of small service providers, but it seems the return on investment is too small in rural markets for their large overhead. ", "11140 Even where they have developed, they can provide adequate speed, but have never given the adequate data cap for most households. ", "11141 As a small service provider, every time I hear of government involvement, it brings fear of what the implications might be for my company. It could be really good, but it also has the potential for disaster for us. ", "11142 As an example, a past grant program allowed other -- another service provider to build infrastructure right next to existing providers. ", "11143 It was not the intent of the grant to overbuild existing service providers, but it happened. It had the unintended result of only eroding the return on investment of the multiple existing service providers while not delivering any more coverage to unserved areas. It reminds me of the Chairman\u2019s analogy of pouring money into sand from his statement on Monday. ", "11144 Contrary to public opinions, many service providers are not making money hand over fist, but are in fact making very small margins and reinvesting back into their service areas and other unserved areas. ", "11145 Government involvement can have serious implications for a small operator. We do not have the office resources to manage a national subsidy program and would be a significant challenge unless it was just a fee we charged on behalf of the Commission and the subsidy was administered through some other mechanism. I\u2019m thinking of something like the Northern Living Allowance that you claim on your tax return if you are eligible. ", "11146 Basic service price regulation would also be a challenge as we need to have enough return on investment to be profitable and how could the Commission undertake to determine that threshold for each company? ", "11147 As a final thought, I mentioned earlier that the lack of available wireless spectrum being a significant problem for small providers. We do not have the capital to bid in the spectrum auctions due to the size of the tier 4 service areas. ", "11148 We are even in danger of losing the RRBS spectrum that we are currently using and it is a significant problem. Without tools to work with, there is no way we can move forward in remote and rural areas no matter what the economic implications are.

VAN DIRSTEIN: Well, it\u2019s a challenging problem I guess. We embrace, you know, government subsidies. It definitely can have a positive impact on our business. But I guess some things seem to fall through the cracks though, and I\u2019m not sure what the answer is for that.", "11169 You know, for us, we\u2019ve been a recipient of government subsidy before and it worked well to promote broadband in more remote areas, and then we\u2019ve also seen the opposite side where another rural provider came in and basically overbuilt over four or five other service providers which we felt kind of eroded our personal investment into these areas.", "11170 So I\u2019m not real sure what the answer is. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified to answer that question entirely.", "11171 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So would you suggest that the primary focus should be on -- and we\u2019ve had a lot of debate about what basic telecom services should be and what speed should be and whatnot, but is your viewpoint that the focus should be on ensuring at least one provider being able to service every Canadian at a minimum target versus directing funding towards overbuilding areas of the country that may already be serviced?", "11172 MR. VAN DIRSTEIN: Yeah, I\u2019m not sure if I would agree with just one provider, but I think any funds need to be targeted at areas that do have a real need and maybe more work could be put into determining whether providers are out there ensuring that, you know, we\u2019re not using public funds to overbuild where there\u2019s already existing providers.", "11173 In Alberta there\u2019s quite a number of, you know, service providers overlapping in a lot of the areas. It\u2019s the more fringe areas where it\u2019s hard to make a business case where those funds need to be dedicated to without bringing in new providers I guess.", "11174 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: In the geography where you operate, do you get the sense, in speaking with your customers, that they view themselves as being well-served, or are there still be it communities or individual homes without that territory that are not able to access broadband services?", "11175 MR. VAN DIRSTEIN: Because of the geography, there are issues where certain people not being able to get the service and I think the majority of them could get satellite internet. ", "11176 A large number of our subscribers and the people that we talk to are not real satisfied with the quality of the satellite service that they can receive, and then there\u2019s some, you know, fairly heavily bushed area where, you know, there\u2019s other issues with connectivity. ", "11177 But for the most part in -- you know, customers have at least six options for service in our particular area, not including the fringe areas where there\u2019s very low population density.", "11178 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: In your second submission of July 14th last year you provided some information about the number of households within -- that you service within your service territory that meet a current target of five megs down one meg up, but I found it interesting that you also noted that about half of your subscribers actually choose a slower package than the target package.", "11179 What is the rationale for that? Is that just a pricing consideration or are there other factors at play in their decision to choose a speed below the 5-1 target?", "11180 MR. VAN DIRSTEIN: A lot of people just don\u2019t need that amount of capacity so they don\u2019t see the need to pay an additional amount to achieve that 5-1.", "11181 You know, our base package is a 3-1 -- or a 3-5-12 or something like that, and it\u2019s sufficient for a lot of people\u2019s needs, especially the older population, you know, that are just surfing the web and checking their email and the odd thing like that, which is kind of what we typically class as, you know, your basic service.", "11182 The more advanced services and the people that are using the 5-1 are typically customers who want to do a lot of video-on-demand where they require that, you know, greater speed in order to do that. ", "11183 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that.", "11184 We have heard from different intervenors in the hearing that believe that we should place an increased focus and greater importance on transport and backhaul facilities in the country. ", "11185 And out of curiosity, in your particular circumstance have you had any problems in obtaining backhaul transport from one of the larger providers in Alberta?", "11186 MR. VAN DIRSTEIN: No problems in obtaining it. Competition is limited though, but at least we have a mechanism to get to the larger markets.", "11187 Up until the last year we felt pricing was out of line. There\u2019s been some changes made that allowed us to get better pricing. We were actually looking at getting service from one of the larger telco\u2019s in the areas we could just because we felt that the pricing model was out of line. ", "11188 But getting access in the communities that they\u2019re in is not -- it\u2019s not a problem.", "11189 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Do you think that there needs to be more competition from a transport standpoint, or do you think what\u2019s out there today is basically adequate to meet the needs and ensure reasonable pricing?", "11190 MR. VAN DIRSTEIN: I guess as a human being I\u2019m always looking for more competition because it drives the price down. I mean, obviously that helps our return on investment. I\u2019m satisfied with the price currently though. ", "11191 One of the -- I\u2019m not sure if I want to get into that. But I guess one of the drawbacks to having one main provider is the support or the customer service maybe is not the same as what you would expect from somebody who require competition to get your business. So that\u2019s been a struggle.", "11192 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Just to switch over to another topic for a minute. You noted earlier today the, you know, increased use of upstreaming and more demand on the part of your customers. ", "11193 Is it difficult from your standpoint to continually upgrade your facilities to ensure that you can meet your customers\u2019 requirements? Or is the technology that you -- without getting into specifics -- is the technology and the networks relatively easily able to be upgraded to meet growing demand or growing need? ", "11194 MR. VAN DIRSTEIN: Well, two main factors in that. Costing, one. The cost and evolution of technology is it\u2019s very costly. We\u2019re constantly reinvesting large amounts of our capital to keep up with new technology and more capacity. ", "11195 Secondly, wireless frequency space is very limited, which is a major problem for us. You know, two of our sites we just don\u2019t add any more customers to because we -- well, there\u2019s been a moratorium on the frequencies that we have been getting. And they\u2019re talking about removing those frequencies with the U.S. repack, UHF TV channels. ", "11196 So that\u2019s been the biggest problem, you know. We need to have a frequency to operate the equipment on before we can even entertain the cost of replacing that equipment. ", "11197 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just one final question. Setting aside the topic of spectrum, because of course that\u2019s handled by Innovation, Science and Economic Development, if you had one request coming out of this public hearing, what would you like to see us do if you could pick your top one or your top two action items? ", "11198 I know it might be unusual for someone sitting in the National Capital Region to ask this question but how can we help?", "11199 MR. VAN DIRSTEIN: Yeah. ", "---(LAUGHTER)", "11200 I\u2019m not sure I know what to answer. I think coordination with ISED is important, you know, our livelihoods are on the line here. And if we don\u2019t have a means to deal with some of these issues that we have I just don\u2019t see, you know, how we can continue on. ", "11201 You know, people are demanding more and more service, traffic, speed, but it\u2019s hard to know how to deliver it. And, you know, the video on demand is a want, I think, for most people and we\u2019re just trying to decide how to deliver that in a real way. ", "11202 You know, the fibre optic backbone in Alberta has provided the ability for service providers to get out into these remote areas, but we\u2019re kind of at a crossroads here on how to deliver the service. We\u2019re looking into fibre into smaller communities to offload off of our tower network. ", "11203 So I\u2019m just not sure what the answer is. ", "11204 And honestly, as a small provider, I\u2019m not sure what the implications are to getting into the fibre market. You know, we almost need a monopoly to be able to pay for the infrastructure costs for a certain period of time. And if regulations say that we have to, you know, give a wholesale rate to another provider, you know, those are concerns on my mind as well. So maybe that\u2019s the direction that the CRTC could look at as well.", "11205 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Perfect. Well, I thank you for taking part and for your answers to my questions. That\u2019s it from me. I\u2019ll hand you back over to my colleagues.", "11206 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. I\u2019ve just polled the other Commissioners on the Panel and legal and those were our questions. So thank you very much for having participated in the hearing. Very much appreciated.", "11207 MR. VAN DIRSTEIN: Thanks for having me. ", "11208 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "11209 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "11210 THE SECRETARY: I will now ask the Canadian Cable Systems Alliance to come to the presentation table. ", "11211 Please introduce yourself and your colleague. Oh, someone is coming. Please introduce yourself and your colleagues, and you have 15 minutes.", "PRESENTATION", "11212 MR. EDWARDS: Good afternoon, Commissioners. Thank you for this opportunity to speak. I\u2019m Chris Edwards, Vice-President of Regulatory Affairs of the Canadian Cable Systems Alliance.", "11213 With me, on my left, are John Piercy, President of Piercy Consulting Inc., who\u2019s assisting CCSA on this file. And on my right, Mike Fiorini, CEO of Cable Cable Inc., a CCSA member based in Fenelon Falls, Ontario. Mike is a director of the CCSA.", "11214 In many of the communities our members serve, broadband transport is available only from a single incumbent. The provision of this service has been forborne and, in such communities, the market does not provide competitive discipline.", "11215 As a result, we commonly hear from members that they are unable to determine where they can connect to or actually gain access to broadband transport.", "11216 In our written submission, we cited specific cases that, taken together, show a wide variance in the pricing of access to fibre backhaul depending on a member\u2019s geographic location and the incumbent from whom they must purchase the service. Those questions of access to and pricing of broadband transport remain our over-riding concern in this proceeding. ", "11217 If our members are to upgrade and extend their broadband networks, there must be some mechanism to ensure that they can secure fair, consistent and reasonable access to and pricing of transport services. In response to other parties\u2019 written submissions and to respond to the Commission\u2019s questions in the public notice, we will offer our comments on definition of the Basic Service Objective, including broadband; cost-effective access to broadband fibre transport facilities; and contribution and subsidy mechanisms. ", "11218 Many commenters support the premise that some level of broadband connectivity is essential to the use by Canadians of a broad range of on-line health, education, commerce, government services and personal communications.", "11219 In addition, the availability of broadband service is a critical enabler of small business activities in communities throughout the country. The existing 5 megabits downstream / 1 megabit up speed targets previously set by the Commission already are being overtaken by the bandwidth demands of available applications.", "11220 The 5/1 minimum may, at this time, remain appropriate for certain remote areas for which wireline networks may never be an economically possible solution. Otherwise, the targets, in our view, should be more in the order of 10 down and 3 up. Looking five to ten years into the future, reasonable aspirational targets might be 25 megabits downstream and 5 up. ", "11221 There is a significant challenge for smaller operators in rolling out last mile facilities that can deliver higher speeds to customers. As the SILEC Joint Task Force has noted, provisioning such facilities \u201cwould be cost prohibitive for private sector companies in the absence of funding from the public sector\u201d.", "11222 Given those challenges, we emphasize that some form of subsidy will be required to achieve those targets in many high cost service areas. In such areas, any obligation to serve should apply only to the provisioning of subsidized services.", "11223 Conversely, for high-cost areas that do not receive subsidy support, the speed targets could be established as being aspirational.", "11224 CCSA recommends that the Basic Service Objective be maintained, essentially as it is today but with replacement of the existing low-speed dial-up element with a broadband element at 10 megabits per second down and 3 up, subject to the availability of subsidies in high-cost areas to help providers achieve the target speeds.", "11225 Finally, we note the comments of the Joint Task Force regarding the importance of standards for technical aspects of the broadband service including elements such as jitter and especially latency. ", "11226 In our view, particularly with respect to lifeline applications such as e-medicine, latency is a key dimension of broadband service and a minimum service standard -- or a minimum standard should apply.", "11227 CCSA believes that for broadband service to be extended to more underserved and unserved Canadians, there must be a subsidy mechanism to construct transport and distribution facilities. ", "11228 That is necessary because existing federal funding programs have concentrated only on capital building projects. They do not address the high operating cost of access to transport facilities on a month-to-month basis. ", "11229 There are three distinct issues to address: discoverability of broadband transport facilities, wholesale pricing of such facilities, and access to those network facilities. ", "11230 With respect to discoverability, the Commission's first role should be to identify, as it is doing, the priority underserved areas. ", "11231 That review should include an assessment of the state of competition and the provision of transport services to such priority areas. ", "11232 That review should include creation of a disclosure mechanism that would support discovery and mapping of the transport networks and connection points available to those areas. ", "11233 We understand that such information may be commercially sensitive and confidential. The Commission could obtain such information on a confidential basis and then act as somewhat of a matching agent with respect to access to that information.", "11234 That is, there could be an arrangement whereby a locally-based provider who is seeking access to broadband backhaul in a given area could say to the Commission: \u201cI want to upgrade or extend service in this community. To whom should I be speaking about backhaul access in my area? Where are the closest facilities and break-out points?\u201d", "11235 With respect to wholesale pricing, CCSA suggests that re-regulation of wholesale transport services would be a complete and effective response to the problems of discovery, pricing, and access in monopoly markets.", "11236 If re-regulation is not an option, then we support TekSavvy\u2019s suggestion that the Commission publish the routes of transport facilities that have been forborne. If the transport facilities are at least discoverable then potential wholesale customers have a starting point from which to work. However, that approach would not resolve issues with pricing and access.", "11237 We suggest that the Commission could go farther to establish a benchmarking process that would periodically establish the competitive market prices for both lit and dark fibre facilities in various fully competitive markets.", "11238 That could take the form, for example, of establishment of base competitive prices for provision of typical inter-community services in a given province or region, and then extrapolation to derive the incremental fixed and variable costs to provide service based on the number of kilometres over which transport service is to be provided.", "11239 The Commission could state its expectations that reasonable pricing of a wholesale transport service should reflect the incremental cost to deliver that transport service, and reasonable pricing for connectivity to non-competitive locations should not exceed the applicable benchmark set for the relevant competitive market by more than a given percentage.", "11240 The Commission could then apply those expectations to the resolution of any commercial disputes between providers and the incumbents that concern provision of such services. ", "11241 CCSA also notes that use of publicly funded and operated community networks such as the Supernet and the Eastern Ontario Regional Network has not been a viable answer to the problem our members have with the cost of transport services.", "11242 Access Communications, for example, advises us that it would pay roughly the same price for 500 megabytes of capacity from the Saskatchewan CommunityNet as it does for 10 gig of transport capacity from Toronto to Regina. ", "11243 Similarly, Cable Cable found that it could build and deliver connectivity for a business customer at a small fraction of the capital and ongoing costs that the customer would pay for connection to the publicly funded regional network.", "11244 With respect to access to transport facilities, the Commission could set rules concerning such matters as access rights to the incumbents\u2019 facilities for connection to transport services, service speeds that match those internally available to the incumbent, and expected service level standards in Service Level Agreements.", "11245 A number of parties have commented that targeted public funding is the appropriate response to rolling out broadband service to Canadians in unserved and underserved areas. ", "11246 We generally agree, but with the proviso that governmental funding programs, because they are time-limited and project oriented, tend to fund only capital projects. ", "11247 On the other hand, the Commission has extensive experience with, and a proven model for, subsidization of telecommunications services to high cost serving areas. CCSA supports implementation of a subsidy model for provision of broadband service to rural and remote areas based on the existing model for subsidy of telephone service to high cost serving areas.", "11248 The subsidy should be used to encourage physical network investment by facilities-based providers as necessary and also to support ongoing delivery of broadband service at affordable prices to high cost serving areas. ", "11249 We are convinced that such a subsidy model will, in fact, encourage network investment and extension by the smaller providers that serve many of the rural and remote areas of the country. Such a subsidy model would be efficient in that it would leverage the existing resources, skills, and networks of local providers who already serve or are adjacent to many underserved or unserved communities.", "11250 CCSA has developed an economic model based on the actual circumstances of Cable Cable, Mr. Fiorini\u2019s company, which is a small provider in the Kawartha Lakes region of Ontario. This model is based on a current actual network build being undertaken by Cable Cable. ", "11251 The project would extend triple-play service to a small enclave of 300 homes that is 8.5 kilometres from Cable Cable\u2019s service area -- existing service area.", "11252 The model is based on actual, present-day costs to provision fibre backhaul over 8.5 kilometres and build out fibre-based local access services to customer premises.", "11253 The model assumes retail service pricing identical to that offered to current customers and take-rates representative of similar builds in the same geographic area.", "11254 Without subsidy, assuming those take-rate and pricing considerations, the payback on investment would take 152 months, or just over 12 and a half years to realize. The five-year net present value of cash flows for the build would be a negative $167,000.", "11255 With a $15 monthly subsidy applied, the payback on investment reduces to 81 months, or 6 and three-quarter years, and the five-year net present value would be a positive $7,500.", "11256 The improved payback on investment that results from subsidy would encourage investment, accelerate projects, and improve smaller providers\u2019 access to third party project financing.", "11257 Cable Cable currently has about eight small communities to which it plans to extend service with similar projects. An appropriate subsidy could greatly accelerate those projects.", "11258 We also believe strongly that any physical network builds should be scalable. With average internet speeds increasing at 25 to 30 percent per year, it will be critical to ensure that any new subsidized network infrastructure should be capable of much higher speeds than the minimum \u201cneeded\u201d service. We suggest that subsidized equipment should be capable of supporting speeds in the order of 25 megabits per second or even 100 downstream.", "11259 We share Eastlink\u2019s concern with any subsidy that is structured in a way that risks stranding investment in physical network builds. We note, as well, the comments of a number of intervenors to the effect that any subsidy mechanism should prioritize investment in wire line infrastructure.", "11260 Finally, the funding should not be used to subsidize overbuilding of existing networks. The system cannot afford the efficiency of duplicating existing physical infrastructure.", "11261 Rather, to the extent any subsidy funds the building of new networks, it should focus on enabling facilities-based providers to develop viable business cases for upgrading service to existing customers to meet the BSO and extending their existing networks out to customers that presently it is economically prohibitive to serve.", "11262 With respect to the contribution side of the fund, CCSA acknowledges that the inclusion of internet revenues in the calculation of contribution-eligible Canadian Telecom Service revenues may be required to support this subsidy.", "11263 Having said that, we agree with CNOC and TekSavvy\u2019s comments regarding the relative uncertainty of the existing contribution regime whereby, once a provider\u2019s CTSRs exceed $10 million, all of the provider\u2019s voice-based revenues become contribution-eligible.", "11264 We agree with those parties that a more effective approach would be to collect contribution from providers who exceed the $10 million threshold, but only on the amount of eligible revenues in excess of the threshold. ", "11265 We suggest, as well, that, if internet revenues are to be included in CTSRs, the Commission should review and potentially raise the contribution threshold to reflect that larger revenue base.", "11266 For CCSA members, the central and critical issue remains that of access to and pricing of broadband transport facilities.", "11267 Until there is reasonable access to those facilities at affordable prices, our members are effectively restrained from upgrading and extending their networks into higher cost areas around them.", "11268 The solution is disclosure of available facilities and establishment of mechanisms that ensure fair and consistent access to and pricing of those facilities. Especially for priority unserved areas, that solution may include construction of new broadband transport facilities.", "11269 Beyond that, independent providers, in particular, require support in extending their existing networks to meet new previously unserved customers and provide affordable ongoing service in higher cost areas. Here again, a subsidization of the cost of extending service to and of serving customers in high cost serving areas would be an appropriate solution.", "11270 We think the Commission can play an important and productive role in both of those areas. ", "11271 That\u2019s our presentation. Thank you very much for your time and attention and we\u2019ll be pleased to answer your questions.", "11272 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you and welcome. But before I pass you on to Vice-Chair Menzies, I really want to say that my welcome is genuine before I say what I\u2019m about to say. You\u2019re just coming up at the wrong time but you\u2019re not being targeted by this.", "11273 Today there was a report issued by Employment and Social Development Canada that found the proportion of women in federally regulated companies has dropped from 46 percent to 41 percent in the past 20 years. And since we\u2019ve started this hearing we\u2019ve faced panels like your own entirely of men. As I say, I\u2019m not picking on you. You\u2019re not alone in this. But, you know, and where there have been women on the panels in these telecom proceedings, they don\u2019t have speaking roles.", "11274 Now I gave a short speech last year at the Canadian Women and Communications and Technology gala that, you know, applauds the work of women in that sector. And I noted that in the fall of 2014 we held 3 major hearings. A hundred and twenty-five (125) women appeared at that hearing -- in those 3 hearings.", "11275 And we calculated that of the 1.8 million words spoken, only 163,000 words were spoken by women sitting at the witness table. Fourteen (14) percent.", "11276 And I called on everyone, including the CRTC, but speaking to government, to the industry and even ourselves, that we can do better. ", "11277 On this panel, all the women appointed by the government as commissioners are here. The CRTC, we strive to make sure that we have staff that -- yeah, there\u2019s unfortunately only two -- that staff balance -- is balanced from a gender perspective.", "11278 In any event, I know there are women in your organizations. So I repeat the call. We can do better.", "11279 MR. EDWARDS: I certainly agree, Mr. Chair. I have the distinct privilege of being the only man in an office with 13 women. And I\u2019m very well trained as a result. So I will say that.", "11280 You know, the other thing that you have to balance off is that we are asked to come here with the people who have the expertise to deal with the questions.", "11281 THE CHAIRPERSON: Absolutely. And I didn\u2019t want to --", "11282 MR. EDWARDS: Yeah.", "11283 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- target you, but I do know that you\u2019ve got a wonderful leadership and they\u2019re obviously running the show. And that\u2019s good. And they\u2019ve sent the right people here to the hearing. It wasn\u2019t -- you just happened to be at the wrong time when this had been a repeated situation so.", "11284 MR. EDWARDS: And I would just say, for the record, we couldn\u2019t agree more.", "11285 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "11286 So Vice-Chair Menzies.", "11287 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So hi, guys.", "11288 Today is actually the -- this is your bad luck. Today is actually the centennial of the day women in Alberta got the vote. So there you go.", "11289 Anyway, let\u2019s move on because this is -- you guys -- yes.", "11290 Thank you very much for this. This oral presentation actually advanced and flushed out a lot of things that I was actually a little confused about from the initial but that\u2019s not unusual. So I\u2019ve kind of reorganized my questions quite considerably around that.", "11291 So can we start with the subsidy? I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m unclear whether you\u2019re promoting -- and this could be wording, funding or subsidy when you -- let\u2019s use the Fiorini example that you gave.", "11292 The -- there\u2019s a $15 monthly per subscriber subsidy that you were using for that example; right?", "11293 MR. PIERCY: That\u2019s correct.", "11294 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Was there any funding for the build?", "11295 MR. PIERCY: No. What we actually did here was we started off looking at this particular build to try to figure out what does the economics look like. As it stands now, Michael\u2019s company is doing this already. ", "11296 And I have an investment banking background as well as an engineering background. And when he told me it was 12 1/2 years payback on his investment, I told him you could not get that funded if you went to a bank and said you wanted to borrow money to do this. They\u2019d look at you like you were from Mars. But he\u2019s doing it because that\u2019s what they do. That\u2019s what our members do this for their communities around them.", "11297 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. That\u2019s an eight and a half kilometre build.", "11298 MR. PIERCY: It\u2019s an 8 1/2 kilometre build, plus a local build to 300 homes.", "11299 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Three hundred (300) homes with a take rate of what, 40 percent?", "11300 MR. PIERCY: So we assumed in this particular model a take rate of 50 percent for internet and then a lower take rate on the TV and telephony. But we actually took those revenues and applied that to get the payback. So this is a triple play service area and all the revenues are being used to pay back.", "11301 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. So an 800 kilometre build to a town of 90 people would have a return of about 125 years?", "11302 MR. PIERCY: Yes, sounds like that would be about right, yeah.", "11303 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. But thanks for that. So that model only conceives of a per subscriber subsidy of 50 -- you know, at a take rate of 50 percent at ---", "11304 MR. PIERCY: We applied that -- you could to this as a capital offset. You could take -- this is about a half million dollar build. You could, you know, take 50 percent of that up front subsidy and then the economics would look better than they do right now. So there\u2019s other ways of skinning the cat, but we were just trying to come up with a -- if there was a subsidy similar to the --", "11305 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah.", "11306 MR. PIERCY: -- voice contribution model, what does it need to be to get this to look like a decent ---", "11307 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It\u2019s actually really helpful to have a --", "11308 MR. PIERCY: Yeah.", "11309 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- sort of perceptual --", "11310 MR. PIERCY: Yeah.", "11311 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- example like that.", "11312 Other things in terms of this, you mentioned minimum latency standard. What was -- actually, let me back up a second on the subsidy. That\u2019s all you\u2019re recommending is that we do is that that sort of -- the subsidy at the subscriber end?", "11313 MR. PIERCY: I think this is a single model that showed a single number. I\u2019m not sure that that applies everywhere. Back to your example of a further off net, fewer communities, is it a different number. I think a subsidy model makes sense of some type and, you know, refer -- when actually and the media was up about in France where they set a price point and then said how much do we have to pay to get that price point. They had a certain economic model. ", "11314 I think we\u2019re the same. We think you need some type of subsidy model. And it can be either up front, recurring or a combination if you want to get these communities that are close to the network but not on network onto the network. Because if you wait for the economics to work right now for our members who are paying for it out of their pocket, it\u2019s going to be a very slow rollout because they just can\u2019t afford to be doing three or four of these at once. It just would bankrupt the company, let alone not be a very successful business plan.", "11315 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. And under that model you had, in that example, let\u2019s use that --", "11316 MR. PIERCY: Yeah.", "11317 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- easier in that -- more fair in that example. There was a positive net present value after 81 months.", "11318 MR. PIERCY: There was a break even. So that -- after 81 months you had gotten back the cash you had invested.", "11319 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. And the subsidy would end then?", "11320 MR. PIERCY: That\u2019s of one of the models and we didn\u2019t actually -- funnily enough, when we did the net present value, we took the subsidy out on the exit date. So the way the net present value was done is five years of cash flow and then a terminal value. The terminal value did not have the subsidy in it because we didn\u2019t think if you were selling this asset you could sell the subsidy. So we did remove it.", "11321 And it might even be a ---", "11322 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, I mean, that sounds fair because --", "11323 MR. PIERCY: Yeah.", "11324 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- especially when you\u2019re -- this is an example about filling gaps in a sense --", "11325 MR. PIERCY: Yes. Yes, it is.", "11326 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- rather than, you know, a major builds and it seems reasonable, especially when you\u2019ve got a fibre built in there that -- and the distance is relatively small, that that subsidy would end at some point. So it would be a subsidy to inspire the build and then disappear. Okay. Great.", "11327 MR. EDWARDS: If I may, just to be clear, that\u2019s -- this is a separate question from the whole question of funding long-haul back --", "11328 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Oh we\u2019ll get to that.", "11329 MR. EDWARDS: -- backhaul.", "11330 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: We\u2019ll get to that.", "11331 MR. EDWARDS: Yeah.", "11332 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You just had more examples in your oral so we\u2019ll back to that.", "11333 I just wanted to find out if that was in addition to or not.", "11334 What would be the minimum latency standard applied? You suggested there should be one.", "11335 MR. EDWARDS: It depends on the delivery network. If it\u2019s wireless it\u2019s considerably bigger; if it\u2019s fibre it\u2019s relatively nothing; coaxial in between somewhere in there. ", "11336 We do have an SLA that we could file an undertaking with you.", "11337 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, that would be great if you could file an undertaking with some numbers sensitive to technology.", "11338 MR. EDWARDS: Sure.", "11339 ", "UNDERTAKING", "11340 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Paragraph 26 of your oral presentation -- we\u2019ll get to the mapping idea a little bit here too. But the confidentiality in terms of mapping access perhaps this could be an undertaking as well. Would you mind sort of framing some legal wording around what that might look like for us?", "11341 MR. EDWARDS: I haven\u2019t given it a lot of thought but we can undertake to provide some sort of a description of a mechanism.", "11342 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I mean, it\u2019s nothing you\u2019re going to be legally bound to in a sense.", "11343 MR. EDWARDS: Right.", "11344 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It\u2019s an example that flushes out what that might get to. Because I looked at that and I didn\u2019t necessarily object or accept the idea, but I did think, oh boy, there\u2019s a whole bunch of regulation happening there.", "11345 MR. EDWARDS: Yeah, perhaps I could just amplify. You know, and I think this was in -- it was either TekSavvy or CNOC\u2019s submission as well. They had a similar proposition.", "11346 And the idea is that the CRTC already gets a fair amount of information in confidence. There may be some more data elements that they require, but there\u2019s no reason to actually divulge confidential information per se, I don\u2019t think. I think it\u2019s rather just helping people who are looking for networks know to whom they should be speaking and, you know, have some sense of the availability, the logical breakout points that would get them where they need to go. So I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s legal language required but we\u2019ll certainly do an undertaking to think about that.", "11347 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Why don\u2019t I take it back and say it doesn\u2019t have to be legal language?", "11348 MR. EDWARDS: Okay. It\u2019s more a mechanism?", "11349 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah. Yes, that would be fine.", "11350 MR. EDWARDS: Okay. ", "11351 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Just something that fills it out, fills out that process a little bit.", "11352 MR. EDWARDS: We\u2019ll accept that undertaking. ", "11353 ", "UNDERTAKING", "11354 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Because I looked at it and I thought, okay, you phone us and ask us, and we check back, and then we phone back and you say you should phone him. And he goes, \u201cFibre, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Right? And then you phone us back, and then we phone them, and you see where it goes? ", "11355 MR. EDWARDS: Yeah.", "11356 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It starts to become a -- I won\u2019t describe it but I think we\u2019ve all been there.", "11357 In paragraphs 53 and 54 of your oral presentation you suggested that any subsidy should prioritize wireline, and I just want to challenge you a little bit on that. Wireline as opposed to satellite when so far the record indicates that some of the most poorly served people are those in satellite communities. And some people might say you should start there and then go there.", "11358 MR. PIERCY: And I think the prioritization wasn\u2019t necessarily a timing prioritization. It would be if in a community you can find a wireline ---", "11359 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I see.", "11360 MR. PIERCY: --- carrier you should go there before you do a wireless or satellite because you get future proofing using that technology. You know a wireline solution, especially a fibre one.", "11361 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, I understand. ", "11362 MR. PIERCY: Yeah. ", "11363 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Thank you for clarifying.", "11364 So in an earlier part you noted that the Connecting Canadians program is restricted to capital costs and the lease of backhaul transport isn\u2019t included. And I take it you would like that changed so leasing costs are allowed as with Connecting Canadians satellite projects; is that correct?", "11365 MR. FIORINI: I think if the subsidy is applied on the access side that that will take care of a portion of the transport costs. Additionally, if there is some kind of action taken to look at the forbearance of transport costs in the discovery and availability of access then I think that would be -- that would take care of it all together.", "11366 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I take it you\u2019ve raised it in the past with the relevant officials?", "11367 MR. EDWARDS: So I\u2019m not completely clear on the question about the leasing side of it but I was actually thinking about something that was said this morning right now by the folks from St-Andr\u00e9, the Mayor.", "11368 And he\u2019d made the comment that maybe it\u2019s not as important as roads and bridges but infrastructure -- but communications infrastructure is important. And I was thinking as he said that I think it\u2019s at least as important and maybe possibly the most important piece of infrastructure right now. ", "11369 So our discussions with government are more about internalizing that idea that communications, telecommunications infrastructure is truly critical infrastructure for Canada going forward. And getting that idea as part of their thinking in infrastructure funding and directing the funding programs that they have towards that. ", "11370 As opposed to right now, you know, Connecting Canada is a separate sort of broadband fund or the new 500 million it\u2019s a sort of separate broadband fun. But we should be thinking about this as building necessary infrastructure. ", "11371 I don\u2019t know if that answers your question or not.", "11372 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, not quite but it does advance the conversation. Forget about the leasing aspect for a moment. When you have taken this issue to government, has it been understood and do you anticipate any changes in the way this is set up?", "11373 MR. EDWARDS: So I was interested to hear Bell talk about how pleased they were to see another commitment to 500 million. We were up asking for exactly the same thing in Ottawa, and so we\u2019re very pleased to see that funding come out. ", "11374 I don\u2019t know if it will be enough to get the job done but, yes, I think it\u2019s our message that you need to be thinking about; this as infrastructure spending and you need to be committing funds to it is getting a good reception.", "11375 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And specific to the ---", "11376 MR. EDWARDS: Our discussions have really been about dedicating funding to building new ---", "11377 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Backhaul.", "11378 MR. EDWARDS: --- transport facilities.", "11379 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right, okay, transport. Good, thank you.", "11380 Now, regarding your request for us to price regulate what we call intercommunity backbone facilities, can we just clarify exactly which services you\u2019re talking about? I think you mentioned dark fibre, the fibre Ethernet transport, IXPL, or everything?", "11381 MR. PIERCY: So the answer is yes. Yeah, I think the services that we\u2019re looking for and that our member companies are looking for to provide internet services in these areas where there\u2019s only a single provider, they\u2019re looking for a minimum of 100 megabits per second. But most are looking now for 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit circuits to get from that community back to the internet map somewhere where you can buy internet transit. ", "11382 And if you can\u2019t get those types of facilities at those types of speeds it\u2019s really hard for you to offer services, especially if the bandwidth of your service to your end user has a high number to it like a 10/3. Because you\u2019ve got to add up all of those in your community plus some overbooking, and that\u2019s what you need to get from that community back to the internet. ", "11383 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for and right now it\u2019s hard to find.", "11384 And I\u2019ll even make another point. You know, I think what SuperNet did was a wonderful thing. I think the EOWC network is a wonderful thing. But they put only 100 meg circuits in. And so if you want to buy a service now that\u2019s 1 gigabit per second you actually have to buy 10 100 megabit circuits at the tariffed rate of 100 megabits times 10 and it becomes more cost effective again. So you need to make sure whatever you allow for backhaul has that scalability element to support the increase in your internet speeds at the end.", "11385 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. All of the above. ", "11386 MR. FIORINI: If I may? I don\u2019t want to add any confusion to what John just said, but I think it\u2019s worth noting that we already had a fixed wireless licence broadband service covering this area. We felt that there was more of an opportunity to bring fibre into the community itself. I just wanted to add that.", "11387 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And just to backtrack on the disclosure of network facilities and the maps there. That apply to everyone and anything that\u2019s there or just ILECs? ", "11388 MR. FIORINI: I\u2019m willing to put my services on the map.", "11389 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. And that\u2019s the position that\u2019s widely held by the association. ", "11390 MR. FIORINI: I think I can speak for everyone in saying yes. ", "11391 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks. ", "11392 So when you talk about the inability to make some of these builds because of the lack of access to those networks or knowledge of where they are on the maps, do you have any estimate about -- of how much capital is -- might currently be sitting idle, waiting for this information so it could build out?", "11393 MR. FIORINI: How do you mean by capital? ", "11394 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, investment capital. Like, the people are anxious to build. It would be anxious to make a build and make a connection if they had access to this -- to the information you require. ", "11395 MR. FIORINI: Well, if I could speak from my perspective as a small system, there's no capital available. Banks don\u2019t like us. They don\u2019t -- they're not interested in --- ", "11396 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well then, why would I do this for you if you don\u2019t have any money? ", "11397 MR. FIORINI: I do it for myself and our customers. We pay for all for all our capital bills out of cash flow. We --- ", "11398 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: How (inaudible) pay out of cash flow?", "11399 MR. FIORINI: Yeah, we do not have huge bonus dividends, drive Lamborghinis, and I don\u2019t own the Raptors. ", "11400 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, I'm just trying to get an idea of what --- ", "11401 MR. FIORINI: So we've -- this is -- we've been doing this since 1983. ", "11402 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, I'm just trying to get an idea of if we do this, (inaudible) some sense of the size of the positive outcome. ", "11403 MR. PIERCY: There are 600 systems in the CCSA membership that are satellite-fed systems now, so these are systems that actually have a cable plant but typically don\u2019t offer internet because they can't get back to the internet. They're just using the cable plant to deliver TV signals, with which they source off satellite. ", "11404 So if we could solve even to half of those, the backhaul, they could light them up, because they have existing infrastructure (inaudible).", "11405 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And more Canadians would have better internet and be happier people?", "11406 MR. PERCY: Yes, and that's not done right now because they can't get backhaul. ", "11407 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Not that I was putting words in your mouth. Thanks. ", "11408 You also suggested -- and this was earlier; you may have mentioned it in the presentation as well -- that the central challenge we're being faced with is how to extend competitive broadband services to Canadians? ", "11409 Now, it's hard to disagree with that in the long term, but I'd like to get your view on whether or not it wouldn't be a good first step just to make sure everyone had reliable service of high quality, and then take the -- and then there's a hierarchy of needs there that --- ", "11410 MR. EDWARDS: I agree with that. The first task is to identify the places, the gaps in service, prioritize those gaps, and start working on getting the networks rolled out. ", "11411 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks.", "11412 Now, the 5 and 1 that others have mentioned, you pooh-pooh a bit and you've determined 10 and 3 as a minimum, which is somewhat more -- it's closer to what some of the accessibility groups and others mention, so why 10 and 3? ", "11413 MR. EDWARDS: I'll turn it over to John here in a second. He'll --- ", "11414 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: More specifically, in term -- because there's been a great deal of --- ", "11415 MR. EDWARDS: Yes, and --- ", "11416 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- comprehensive evidence put in front of us that says 5 and 1 is all you need. Government websites, et cetera, et cetera -- I expect we'll hear more tomorrow too. ", "11417 MR. EDWARDS: Just as a general statement, it's a target that fits today's needs, the applications that ride, as again, some of the witnesses we heard this morning talking about automated farming operations and so on. ", "11418 There's a lot of concentration on residential customers in this conversation, but there are business customers, there are home businesses, and so on. ", "11419 The up -- the one megabit upload probably isn't enough and -- but generally, the comment is, I think that's a reasonable requirement for what's required now, right John? ", "11420 MR. PIERCY: And I think also we're looking that this is going to take a number of years, two or three years to roll out, to get deployed, and at the internet growing at the pace it's growing, it would be a shame to get there, then find 5 by 1 is too slow and I got to go back and do it again, potentially and potentially change out gear to get to a higher number. ", "11421 So we thought if you're going to do a subsidy of some type, you should be going for a speed that's going to be more satisfactory in two to three years. ", "11422 Also, on the business side, we're seeing more and more demand from small businesses that want to get into the cloud-based services using cloud services for MRPA and customer relationship management. There's a lot of data that gets pushed around and if your upload's only one meg and you got five or six people working in your business using these cloud services, you'll find that upload untenable from a business point of view.", "11423 So we felt that a 3 meg upload was something you should be just, you know, looking for because it's going to be needed. ", "11424 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. (Inaudible) just two questions too (inaudible). ", "11425 MR. EDWARDS: If I can add one other thing; we were having a conversation yesterday and Michael was talking about what his call centre hears these days about upload. ", "11426 MR. FIORINI: We receive many, many, inquiries out of our -- from people not in our service area and people in our service area looking for more and more upload. The download speeds are already there. Technology exists for 10 megs now and it will in the future. It's the uploads that people require. ", "11427 If you -- with 1 megabit, you know, you'll strangle your downloads just by filling all that upload, so that's -- we get -- I don't know what the count is, but we're receiving many calls on a regular basis. ", "11428 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Actually, between the two of you, you answered my next three questions as well, so it's very efficient so far. ", "11429 Datacam minimums? ", "11430 MR. FIORINI: Perhaps --- ", "11431 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: We've heard quite a bit about --- ", "11432 MR. FIORINI: Perhaps --- ", "11433 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- you know, it\u2019s not so much the speed, its --- ", "11434 MR. FIORINI: --- (inaudible) those --- ", "11435 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- the whole package, and --- ", "11436 MR. FIORINI: Yeah, it's a -- I mean, right now we don\u2019t offer -- we don\u2019t impose data caps. ", "11437 However, with the onset of higher and higher usage, and you know, incremental costs, there may be the need down the road to look at a meter-type service. ", "11438 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, because we're anticipating -- your argument anticipates higher usage and --- ", "11439 MR. FIORINI: Yeah, I think with the --- ", "11440 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- new apps and that sort of stuff, two or three (inaudible)? ", "11441 MR. FIORINI: Yeah, specifically with providers in small remote areas that are using -- like, SaskaTel is a great example, and Chris can speak to that. They have very limited access to transport costs, so their customers are looking for more and more bandwidth. They're giving them as much as they can, but they keep using more and more. ", "11442 So -- and every incremental megabit that they have to incur or bring into that hub, it's an incremental cost to them. So it makes sense that they start looking at a metered basis, where the customer would pay beyond a certain usage. ", "11443 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks. ", "11444 Are you aware of any provinces in the broadband infrastructure funding business these days?", "11445 MR. EDWARDS: Well, certainly in our written submission we referred to a couple of examples where our members faced some high pricing in B.C. and the government stepped in to make that more reasonable, but we haven't looked across the provinces to see who has which fund. ", "11446 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, because I know you mentioned the federal. ", "11447 In terms of any funds, you -- funding that might be created for infrastructure or transport or anything else, I guess, in terms of that, but didn\u2019t apply, other than the subsidy that might apply to the subscriber, you mentioned that your members are more efficient, generally, than others.", "11448 So I just want to get a sense of what -- notwithstanding the other issue, the previous issue -- what your members' experience may have been with -- why that shouldn't have come out -- been more evident in the reverse-auction process or whether any of your members have benefited from the federal funding in that regard, and what they were able to achieve, if they did.", "11449 MR. EDWARDS: So I'm not sure I can speak to more efficient use of funds by members, if that's your question. ", "11450 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, no, it was -- you were generally more efficient, so I thought that in the reverse-auction process it might favour you. ", "11451 MR. FIORINI: I can tell you, we've participated in a couple of, I guess, programs and we just couldn't meet the timelines. The -- some of the requirements were onerous. ", "11452 For instance, a security bond on construction, that's huge for a small system to take -- undertake, even with a -- it's beyond a 20-day timeline. ", "11453 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Especially if the banks don\u2019t like you. ", "11454 MR. FIORINI: Yeah, especially if the banks don\u2019t like us. ", "11455 And you know, even a commercial letter of credit, which I'm sure we could scrape together somehow with the proper bank facility, even that wasn\u2019t acceptable. ", "11456 The timeline was, I believe, a month to submit the proposal, and the people I spoke to said you couldn\u2019t -- you could not become qualified inside that timeline.", "11457 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So for one reason or another it\u2019s fair to say that this funding has been inaccessible to your membership?", "11458 MR. FIORINI: Yeah.", "11459 MR. EDWARDS: Are we talking about Connect Canada funding here?", "11460 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah.", "11461 MR. EDWARDS: Yeah, so ---", "11462 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, I don\u2019t know about any others.", "11463 MR. EDWARDS: The digital 150 round, the one that happened over the last couple of years, CCSA actually retained a consultant to help our members apply for the funding. ", "11464 The red tape involved with the application itself we spoke with Industry Canada before that round actually started to happen and they actually reduced the complexity of that application process quite a bit after conversation with us.", "11465 So we retained a consultant. We had I think maybe about 80 applications for projects, and in the end I think our members got funding for about 42 individual projects. ", "11466 So that did work better, and we\u2019re hoping to continue working with Innovation and Science to get the process more easily penetrable by our members and to help them. And we\u2019ll continue to help our members through that process when these funding tranches come around.", "11467 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you again for a very precise presentation and for -- particularly today for filling in a lot of the gaps there. It really allowed for something much more targeted and we appreciate it.", "11468 So those are my questions. My colleagues may have some.", "11469 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "11470 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Good afternoon.", "11471 I want to go back to the business case. You mentioned in your business case that you assumed 50 percent adoption of internet, 40 percent of overlay services like voice and TV.", "11472 MR. FIORINI: The overlay voice and TV were significantly less. If we go into an area ---", "11473 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So are you planning to build in an area that\u2019s already served? Is that why you have those levels of adoption?", "11474 MR. FIORINI: Served -- so you brought up ---", "11475 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: They have internet access today?", "11476 MR. FIORINI: They have wireless, and that\u2019s through us and through Xplornet. But we find there\u2019s a market opportunity for bringing them in bigger bandwidth and through fibre to the home.", "11477 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you\u2019re providing wireless in that community already?", "11478 MR. FIORINI: Yes.", "11479 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you\u2019re looking here at an incremental business plan then over and above ---", "11480 MR. FIORINI: This is called a forklift upgrade if you want to. It could be called that.", "11481 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. So the business model you\u2019re looking at here is looking at upgrading from wireless to fibre -- fibre-coax?", "11482 MR. FIORINI: Yes.", "11483 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Fibre?", "11484 MR. FIORINI: Fibre.", "11485 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And by upgrading you\u2019re assuming 50 percent greater adoption of internet?", "11486 MR. FIORINI: Yes.", "11487 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I see. Okay.", "11488 And with your existing service -- wireless service -- is Xplornet wireless or satellite?", "11489 MR. FIORINI: Yes, Xplornet\u2019s wireless.", "11490 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Oh, so they have -- do they have -- are they using like an LTE technology in there?", "11491 MR. FIORINI: Not in that area, as far as I know, but it\u2019s coming.", "11492 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. And you\u2019re using -- give me an example of the service you have in there today. ", "11493 MR. FIORINI: For the wireless service we use a 3.5 gigahertz licence spectrum. We are ---", "11494 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And what are you offering to customers?", "11495 MR. FIORINI: We\u2019re rolling out LTE services as we speak. However, we currently have in place an RF-based wireless. It\u2019s a DOCSIS-based technology. So our speeds are three down one up and five down one up.", "11496 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking to upgrade to fibre?", "11497 MR. FIORINI: Yes.", "11498 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay.", "11499 MR. FIORINI: We just ---", "11500 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, it might be a little hard. I understand you\u2019ve done the business plan and making a commitment with your own money, but in a community of 300 to upgrade against competitive suppliers ---", "11501 MR. FIORINI: I\u2019m taking bets.", "11502 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Pardon?", "11503 MR. FIORINI: I\u2019ll take some bets on that. We\u2019re going to be just fine.", "11504 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah ---", "11505 MR. FIORINI: I\u2019m pretty confident.", "11506 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, and I\u2019m not suggesting you don\u2019t make the investment, but I can understand why it would be a harder business case to meet.", "11507 MR. FIORINI: Very.", "11508 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. And I know you\u2019ve discussed it with the Vice-Chair on the transport, but I have an interest in this transport because I\u2019ve asked a few people through this proceeding and some folks -- like I talked to TekSavvy and they talked about this issue of discoverability, and I talked to somebody the next day and they said no that\u2019s not an issue, so I\u2019m hearing different stories.", "11509 I\u2019ll accept that you consider it to be an issue even knowing what is available within ---", "11510 MR. FIORINI: I\u2019m relatively available. We play nice with our competitors in our area. I know where Cogeco has their facilities, and I know, to some degree, where Bell has theirs, and more along the lines with respect to Bell winning the Eastern Ontario Wardens\u2019 Caucus RFP, so that is public knowledge.", "11511 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "11512 MR. FIORINI: What\u2019s not public knowledge is the process or the pricing. It\u2019s very tough to get to. Weeks -- there\u2019s many -- there\u2019s a lot of delays. There\u2019s exponential non-recurring costs involved, and obviously the recurring charges are even -- they\u2019re escalated as well.", "11513 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So discoverability isn\u2019t necessarily the issue, discovering the place?", "11514 MR. FIORINI: In some cases with Cogeco because I -- just because I\u2019ve been working with them since forever whereas Bell I have not, so it\u2019s hard to tell where Bell\u2019s facilities are. We know where their central office is located and that is about it.", "11515 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "11516 MR. PIERCY: I would say that I think ---", "11517 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: This is a question I\u2019m going to ask others.", "11518 MR. PIERCY: It also depends on who you are and what territory you\u2019re in and who you\u2019re dealing with. So we have a number of examples mainly out west where our members have asked \u201ccan I get connectivity to this town\u201d and be told \u201cno, we don\u2019t have facilities\u201d and then we find out later they do have facilities and they just didn\u2019t want to enable a competitor.", "11519 Because what they are doing is you\u2019re buying from the person who you\u2019re also competing with in delivery of service or may be competing with and they\u2019re trying to get there before you. And so that\u2019s why discovery is a bit of an issue, not all over and not with every one of our members but with a large number of our members.", "11520 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I\u2019ll need to do some background on here -- on this, but as I sit here I really am not sure I understand why it has to be competitively sensitive who has facilities -- backhaul facilities or transport facilities through Canada. I mean ---", "11521 MR. FIORINI: I agree. I don\u2019t know why it has to be so sensitive ---", "11522 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No.", "11523 MR. FIORINI: --- and so quiet and hush-hush, but ---", "11524 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I understand we don\u2019t want to put it all on a map and show the points, you know, for the world to see.", "11525 MR. FIORINI: Why not?", "11526 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, maybe we don\u2019t want that, but ---", "11527 MR. FIORINI: Something close to that.", "11528 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But, yeah, it isn\u2019t clear to me. ", "11529 You don\u2019t know why it\u2019s competitively sensitive?", "11530 I\u2019m going to ask some of the people that are holding these facilities too.", "11531 MR. FIORINI: They\u2019d be the ones to ask.", "11532 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah. And so where there is one provider it would be your view that that should be a regulated product?", "11533 MR. EDWARDS: I mean, our presentation said that we thought that re-regulation where those markets are non-competitive would be an answer. I guess we\u2019re not certain that that\u2019s practically available as a regulatory response and so we\u2019ve tried to suggest other mechanisms that might work.", "11534 But certainly, in theory, if there\u2019s no competition in a market and those facilities are not becoming available as a result or not equitably priced as a result then yeah re-regulation would be the thing to do. ", "11535 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And as we\u2019re talking about some essentially fibre -- I mean that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking here -- fibre transport -- is there any reason to believe that the costs in these non-competitive routes would be that much different, the actual cost if they should be that much different than they are in other parts of Canada?", "11536 MR. FIORINI: Well, from our perspective, I think that they know that where the high cost serving area is and low cost serving area is, and it\u2019s easier to get more competition into a low cost serving area.", "11537 Toronto is filled with fibre providers. The Kawartha Lakes is ---", "11538 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I know, and I don\u2019t want to -- I understand that the price is less in Toronto, but actually installing fibre, you know, I mean it\u2019s distance sensitive, but not hugely distance sensitive so ---", "11539 MR. FIORINI: The economies get better as you add more mileage.", "11540 MR. PIERCY: We don\u2019t think there\u2019s significant difference between, you know, a build to a non-competitive area or the cost to provide a service there into a competitive area. It\u2019s the same fibre, you use the same labour. ", "11541 There\u2019s mileage sensitivity to the build, we understand that, but the electronics on there, the cost of the fibre that\u2019s standard. They don\u2019t charge different, so. ", "11542 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Exactly. I mean that\u2019s the wonderful -- I can\u2019t even say that. That\u2019s the great world of digital; right? ", "11543 MR. PIERCY: Yes, yes.", "11544 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You know? You get rid of some of these distances so ---", "11545 MR. EDWARDS: And that was really the thinking behind this concept of benchmarking, is you look at fully competitive markets, you know, what\u2019s the pricing there.", "11546 And realistically we can\u2019t think of a reason why, you know, in these non-competitive markets it should be 100 percent more costly to provide those facilities, for instance. ", "11547 Maybe 10 percent but ---", "11548 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You have provided a pretty interesting example here with Access, so I suppose maybe there will be people coming forward later, such as SaskTel who runs the community net too, who can maybe explain why there would be such significant differences in costs or prices.", "11549 MR. EDWARDS: So I think John can speak to this better than I, but I guess the point I wanted to make is we\u2019re not necessarily alleging an anti-competitive practice here. ", "11550 I think it\u2019s more about the technology upon which those networks were built and it\u2019s just a fact of how it was done.", "11551 MR. PIERCY: All of these networks were built eight years ago. I think Super-Net they said 9-10 years ago. ", "11552 And when they did this 100 megabits was considered to be blazing speed, so they were designed and built to deliver 100 megabits circuits to the end-user.", "11553 So now when you need a 1 gigabit circuit you\u2019ve got to buy 10 of these 100 megs circuits and put a device in to aggregate it back up to give yourself a 1 gig circuit. ", "11554 So it\u2019s almost we picked the wrong technology and we should have bet on a 1 gig becoming the norm, but we didn\u2019t and now what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re saying if you want 5 of these 100 megs circuits it\u2019s 5 times the price. ", "11555 And you know with bandwidth typically 1 gigabit costs you about the same price as 250 megabits. As you start going up in speed the cost per bit goes down significantly. ", "11556 That doesn\u2019t happen in these community networks, because they\u2019re built on $800 per 100 megabits connection and so if you need multiple you just pay multiple times $800 and it gets very expensive.", "11557 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay so you have actually confused me now. ", "11558 When you say they were built on those connections --", "11559 MR. PIERCY: Well they were -- they were ---", "11560 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- one of the promises of fibre is it is scalable and future-proof.", "11561 MR. PIERCY: But a lot of these networks when they committed to what we deliver to a third party, it was I will do an $800 100 megabits connection and that\u2019s what these were launched more than 10 years go..", "11562 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes, so it\u2019s the pricing, it\u2019s not the cost.", "11563 MR. PIERCY: But a lot of them then deployed equipment where the line cards are all 100 megs line cards. So they actually deployed physical infrastructure that doesn\u2019t allow them to offer a 1 gig circuit or a wavelength connection, because that was never envisioned when these networks were designed.", "11564 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But it\u2019s scalable?", "11565 MR. PIERCY: Well the backbone is infinitely scalable. ", "11566 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You can replace line cards.", "11567 MR. PIERCY: You\u2019ve got to replace line cards or put in new electronics and --", "11568 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "11569 MR. PIERCY: -- I just heard actually the ER network has been asking for an upgrade amount to do that, to actually upgrade it from 100 megs to 1 gig. ", "11570 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Well thank you. Those are my questions. ", "11571 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. ", "11572 Well that conversation opens up a field I wanted to deal with. I mean, ideally we should always be planning for the future within reasonable predictability. ", "11573 Sometimes I wonder if, you know, I wish a few years back when I had built my house I had put in a 240 plug in my garage so that it would make more sense to have a rechargeable vehicle, but I probably wouldn\u2019t even have thought of that even if somebody had said that\u2019s something I should do.", "11574 But it brings me to the comments I was making earlier this week about maybe having to think about all regulatory role within a broader context and of a strategy -- a Canadian strategy.", "11575 And I appreciate that with your large membership, turning around a presentation last minute would have been a bit of a challenge.", "11576 And plus, you know, we give you a certain amount of time to make a presentation and you had regulatory points to make. I appreciate that. ", "11577 But I will ask you if you had some thoughts on a broader strategy in which we should -- we have a part, we\u2019re not the only players but there are others and what should that be?", "11578 Now you could -- if you\u2019re saying to me that, you know, we need a little bit more time, that\u2019s fair and we can do it through an undertaking.", "11579 But this morning I was asking, you know, when you do public policy and strategies overall, you look at the current state, you probably do a swat analysis of some sort, you look at the environment, then you think about where you want to be, you know, within a reasonable timeframe. Then you do a gap analysis between current state, future state. I mean, businesses do this as well. It\u2019s not just a regulatory policy.", "11580 Then you create specific action plans, some of which will be the CRTC\u2019s, some of which maybe someone else\u2019s to address that broader gap analysis and then over time you evaluate how you\u2019re doing to getting to that objective and do some course correction if required. ", "11581 So thinking of that and all the issues I identified earlier this week, as I say they\u2019re not always CRTC bailiwick, but some have called on us to maybe give recommendations to those that maybe are responsible for these.", "11582 I was wondering if you have anything to share at this point or later on?", "11583 MR. EDWARDS: So I guess, you know, the first couple of stages of that cycle you just took us through, are really looking -- defining what the problem is and prioritizing elements of the problem and so the mapping exercise at the start is very important.", "11584 At a certain point you do run up against what is the CRTC\u2019s jurisdiction versus other governmental bodies and so on.", "11585 I certainly see a role in ---", "11586 THE CHAIRPERSON: But just on that, let\u2019s make sure that ---", "11587 MR. EDWARDS: Yes.", "11588 THE CHAIRPERSON: In the past we have given reports, more broad reports.", "11589 MR. EDWARDS: Yes.", "11590 THE CHAIRPERSON: On the state of play, even though we may not be the ones actually implementing the regulations. ", "11591 MR. EDWARDS: Yes, exactly.", "11592 THE CHAIRPERSON: It was quite common in the nineties. We recognize that we have limited jurisdiction. ", "11593 MR. EDWARDS: Exactly and I think that\u2019s a key element of where I was going is, you know, it\u2019s looking at the unserved, underserved areas, making sure you know where those are and then it\u2019s prioritising as best you can.", "11594 And then I do think probably that takes the form of some sort of reporting to the line departments and government or to parliament, however that goes. ", "11595 So that they understand -- and that becomes a first step in hopefully developing some sort of coordinated approach among the various governmental bodies. ", "11596 So for instance settling on standards for speed, latencies, other technical characteristics; you know?", "11597 A report could recommend that industry Canada when it\u2019s doing its funding programs needs to -- you know everybody needs to be working to the same standards and the same objectives and hopefully to the same prioritized list of the regions, or communities, or whatever it is, that that government wants to approach.", "11598 So I think the CRTC can play a tremendous role in defining that part and then you get up to the level of -- and so then there\u2019s the stage of, you know, Industry Canada and the CRTC. ", "11599 For instance coordinating, you know, operational subsidy versus capital building programs and so on. That\u2019s all fine and I think that works.", "11600 The part where I think it gets trickiest is when the provinces and the municipalities -- when you consider the sorts of programs they\u2019re running, the initiatives they\u2019re undertaking and how do you get that all coordinated so that right across the board the resources are being applied consistent with the recommended plan that came out of the CRTC for instance and now has been adopted by the ministers or whatever it is, over by parliament. ", "11601 And I don\u2019t know how you do that part. That\u2019s what I keep bumping up when I think about it. And I think if some of these examples we gave in our written submission where we say well a member was looking to apply for Connect Canada funding and then he realized, you know, he called up the incumbent and said what am I going to pay for bandwidth so I can serve these extra 250 homes and he found out there was no business case for it. ", "11602 And then somehow the province gets involved and the cost comes down to be reasonable, and so maybe something works, but that\u2019s a tremendously inefficient process. ", "11603 And the part I hadn\u2019t been able to get my head around yet is how you looped the municipalities, the wardens, the provincial governments all into a process other than some sort of conference where everybody buys into a plan. ", "11604 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "11605 MR. EDWARDS: Having said that, you know, much of what Mr. Price said earlier today was very interesting as an approach. I guess that\u2019s the other thing I ---", "11606 THE CHAIRPERSON: I appreciate that not everybody follows. It reminds me of sometimes you\u2019re in a group of friends and you\u2019re discussing where you should go for dinner and you waste 30 minutes figuring it out and rather than doing anything and it\u2019s because nobody\u2019s stepping up. ", "11607 Yeah, it\u2019s not ideal, maybe not everybody will go, but in the end, not deciding is worse than deciding on something that now everybody buys in because you at least have something. And that\u2019s a bit -- in the spirit I was raising my points the other day, is that there\u2019s a vacuum. ", "11608 And you folks or some of your representatives had participated, for instance, in the previous report process back in 2002, I think, \u201903, or something like that. Governor General Johnson authored at the end. But at least we have that. And I guess an action involves -- could include making sure we have the right governance around it to make sure that people are buying into it. ", "11609 But just saying it\u2019s too hard to fix because it\u2019s like herding cats -- herding cats is not impossible, it is actually -- it may be complex, it may be complicated, but I\u2019m sure we have the science for it. ", "11610 And it\u2019s a bit the same sort of call I\u2019m giving here because there are issues, I don\u2019t know if -- some people have raised poverty issues, skilled development in remote areas, literacy, digital literacy type issues, even knowledge of what people should have and mean because it\u2019s not intuitive at this point. ", "11611 There\u2019s a whole bunch of issues that we keep having, showing up on our shores because we run regular public consultations where it\u2019s open, transparent and there\u2019s very little barrier to entry in the hearing room or participation and there\u2019s a frustration, at least on my part, and I think my colleagues on the Panel here, that we keep having these issues wash on our shores and nobody is doing anything about it. ", "11612 MR. EDWARDS: So again, just thinking about, if I try and make it concrete to myself what a report to the minister would look like or department, one thing that can be done is to clearly carve away the social welfare issues from the issues that, you know, the issues that you -- that taxpayers or Canadians and citizens should be resolving as opposed to those that the industry and the Commission itself should be resolving. So that might be one way of delineating issues. ", "11613 There was something else I wanted to raise, and it actually goes to what the previous presenter was saying and another thing -- another area focus in the coordination realm is this whole question of public funds being used to overbill existing networks. ", "11614 And I think that\u2019s got to be a real focus. And so we\u2019ve seen some of this as well, I think some of the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, actually, overbilled Mike\u2019s area. So this is an inefficient use of resources given a limited pot available. ", "11615 And so I think maybe that\u2019s something else that the Commission could at least start the conversation on is why are we working against each other and how do we afford duplicating or overriding resources. ", "11616 And just the other part of that, I think, just quite a specific point I wanted to raise, the mapping exercise that\u2019s going on -- and we\u2019ve dealt with hexagons since back in the deferral accounts proceeding, there needs to be some sort of clear challenge mechanism for somebody, I guess publication and challenge mechanism. ", "11617 A lot of these small operators don\u2019t caught on to the fact that their area is showing up as served or whether it is unserved on a map when they\u2019re in fact providing some level of service there. Or it may just not quite meet the criteria that innovation and science has set for service. ", "11618 And so I think there\u2019s probably a requirement for some sort of publication and challenge process to make sure that we really do know where the surface is. ", "11619 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well certainly, from our perspective, we were open to that that it\u2019s supposed to be an Evergreen document so, if there is that. ", "11620 But I\u2019m -- I guess I\u2019m calling on you to help us figure out what that is. I mean, you bring me perspective that is rather quite important in light of where you\u2019re operating to this gap and so I very much would appreciate it. ", "11621 MR. FIORINI: Well, at the risk of getting another one from Chris, I really like the Industry Canada first come, first serve model. If they are competitors in the area with that same licensing, you can undertake a first come, first serve prior to them entering the market. ", "11622 So we did that. We did the 3.5 spectrum first come, first serve licence. We were the first ones to launch it in the area, then the auction came along. We maintain that first come, first serve spectrum and we\u2019re still enjoying it today. ", "11623 So that works on a micro basis. So you take certain hexagons on the map and you drive down into those -- further into those hexagons. There\u2019s areas that are not served, even though that hexagon is painted red or pink or whatever the colour is for served, it\u2019s not all served. So there are areas. ", "11624 So I was giving the example to these gentlemen earlier today, say well, there\u2019s a street with 25 houses down and our fibre goes right by it. There\u2019s an opportunity. ", "11625 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So conscious that maybe you didn\u2019t have time to consult as a group because you\u2019re an association, would you be able to undertake to propose, from your perspective, it\u2019s always from your perspective, how we could develop, or at least the issues we should consider to ensure a coordinated, collaborative, open, transparent broadband strategy? ", "11626 MR. FIORINI: I smell a working group. It might boil down to that. It seemed to have worked in several other hearings, so I\u2019m not opposed to that. But as a membership, I think that we can do something, put some kind of suggestion forward. We\u2019ll see, I guess. ", "11627 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. ", "11628 MR. EDWARDS: I\u2019m not sure if I can do this, but I\u2019m a little cautious about taking that on as an undertaking for May 5th, and I wonder if that\u2019s something we could address in our final comments, which come a couple of weeks later? ", "11629 THE CHAIRPERSON: You certainly can. This was going to be my second question. You\u2019re an expert in these proceedings. There\u2019s a page limitation for the final comments. Do you have any procedural suggestions for us? Because we\u2019ve sort of added a few issues. ", "11630 MR. EDWARDS: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. ", "11631 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you think you can address everything that I\u2019ve just asked in final comments with the page limitation? ", "11632 MR. EDWARDS: Yes. ", "11633 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. As long as that\u2019s clear. That\u2019s good. We\u2019ll see what others might think. Okay. Good. Thank you. ", "11634 I believe those are all our questions. Thank you very much. And please don\u2019t think I was just picking on you with my earlier comments. I certainly wasn\u2019t. ", "11635 MR. FIORINI: My mother, my aunts, my sisters, my cousins are going to thank you later, I\u2019m sure. ", "11636 THE CHAIRPERSON: Indeed. Well brought up. That\u2019s good too. Thank you. ", "11637 Madame la secr\u00e9taire? ", "11638 THE SECRETARY: Mr. Phillips is not in the room so his intervention will be on the public record. ", "11639 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.

Presenting with me is William Amos, Member of Parliament for Pontiac.", "11650 Together, our neighbouring ridings cover a territory of some 50,000 km, equivalent to about half of South Korea. Containing tens of thousands of square kilometres of non-organised territories and some 87 municipalities, our ridings are typical of rural Canada.", "11651 Chairman, digital infrastructure in the small communities dispersed across our ridings is a generation behind our urban counterparts. Every year, we fall another year behind and the gap between our constituents and other Canadians widens.", "11652 Furthermore, our social, economic, and youth retention problems are all compounded by the lack of proper network access.", "11653 Let me give you an example. In the town of Lantier, population 724, I have a constituent who recently had to drive to a friend\u2019s house at 10:00 p.m. to submit her daughter\u2019s homework in time.", "11654 In Notre-Dame-du-Laus, with 1,633 inhabitants, another constituent was telling me about driving 20 minutes to park downtown every few days in order to access news and e-mail.", "11655 Entire communities in our ridings have no broadband internet whatsoever, and many do not have cell phone signal either. For us, these issues are one and the same. The lines between telephony, television, and internet are so blurry in 2016 as to be wholly irrelevant.", "11656 In the age of convergence, our digital infrastructure needs to be considered holistically.", "11657 Will Amos and I submitted a brief on this topic back in February and I will not rehash all of it today.", "11658 But I will highlight that while single-purpose telephones and televisions continue their march toward obsolescence, in rural Canada where landlines and satellite dishes continue to be the principal connection to the outside world, a generation is growing up without adequate access to the technology that is bringing everyone else together. It is a situation that must be addressed quickly and forcefully.", "11663 Chair, in 2016, high speed internet is an essential service to participate in the modern economy, in modern culture, and in modern democracy. In 2016, proper internet access is a rite of passage into the information society.", "11664 It must, therefore, be considered a right and, as a baseline, anyone who has access to electricity must have access to high speed internet.", "11678 We have a responsibility to make room for all Canadians on the train of the digital revolution. I am proud to say that the government recognizes the transformational nature of the times. I am truly pleased by the $500 million investment for rural connectivity announced in the last budget, and even more excited by the promise that this is the first step in a long-term strategy that will truly address the problem.", "11679 At the same time, my colleague and I believe that certain adjustments on the regulatory front might contribute to bridging the digital divide. It is our contention that the CRTC and other relevant actors should consider a few actions aimed at equalising Canada\u2019s internet access.", "11680 Let me be clear that these suggestions are ideas for discussion and that they are formulated in our role as MPs, representing the voices of our constituents. They should be taken neither as the position of the Liberal Party nor as that of the government. They are ideas that we would like relevant stakeholders to consider.", "11686 That, as a general rule, no connection with a packet round-trip time in excess of 100 milliseconds to the nearest backbone should be considered high speed, as longer delays result in excessive latency limiting the usefulness of fast connections;", "11687 That no connection with a sustained capacity below 10 megabits should be considered high speed, and that this threshold should increase on an annual basis reflecting the reality of internet usage, much in the way the Consumer Price Index follows the cost of living. What is considered high speed today will no doubt feel like dial-up to our children;", "11688 That bandwidth caps should themselves be capped and regulated, and restricted to situations that are technically justified. A high speed connection with a 40 gigabit monthly cap was not adequate before the advent of widespread internet video, let alone today, but it is the norm in rural Canada;", "11689 And finally, that the myth according to which the free market, on its own, can resolve these problems be dispensed with. If it were indeed the case, we would have no need to be here today.", "11695 I salute the CRTC, my former employer, for the invitation and for the effort around this Let\u2019s Talk Broadband hearing. ", "11696 It\u2019s an important conversation. It is actually one that we did in our ridings have during the election.", "11697 It was -- this is a key issue for our small businesses, for our farmers, indeed for everyone in our riding. ", "11698 We know that the future success of our economies is distinctly related to the regulatory regime reforms, as well as the investments made by multiple levels of government.", "11699 I\u2019m proud that our government has made a significant investment through the budget and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the rollout of the expenditures. ", "11700 That\u2019s going to involve lots of consultation I\u2019m sure and I think that it\u2019s important to give that process time, but I\u2019m sure that the Minister of Innovation, Navdeep Bains, is ready to do a phenomenal job of identifying exactly how the Federal Government can best contribute with that half billion dollars towards the growth of our digital economy.", "11701 It\u2019s so important because at the end of the day this is, for the riding of Pontiac, this is about youth retention, it\u2019s about keeping our young kids in the towns they grew up in. ", "11702 It\u2019s about the isolation of seniors, it\u2019s about small business expansion, it\u2019s about agricultural modernisation, of course it\u2019s about democratic participation.", "11703 And I think that if you look at this in a macro sense, this is really about the reconciliation of what many people describe now as a rural urban divide.", "11704 So with respect to that threshold question of whether broadband access ought to be included in the basic telecom service definition, I think the answer is a resounding yes. ", "11705 And it is the case that high speed internet must be incorporated. ", "11706 But many other questions flow from that ---- what I think is a fairly trite conclusion. You know, how do you -- how do you get it to high cost areas, how do you finance digital infrastructure buildout.", "11707 The potential for low income subsidies and in Pontiac there are so many low income situations and that\u2019s -- it\u2019s just crucial for the -- for this Panel to understand that you know we have so many, so many individuals, so many families living on a net income of less than $30,000 a year. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a hard reality in Vall\u00e9e-de-la-Gatineau and in the Pontiac. ", "11708 I note that the -- that previous intervenors such as the Affordable Access Coalition were supported by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture in Cullen(Ph) for a contribution fund to include internet revenue with download speeds of at least 10 megabytes per second. ", "11709 That\u2019s something that I think is an appropriate direction, but I mean I\u2019m conscious of the fact that, you know, I don\u2019t represent government here and I do respect the independence of the CRTC to make its own regulatory decision to pursue the public interest pursuant to the legislative responsibilities that you have under the telecommunications Act.", "11710 So I would simply say that I would hope that the -- that an updated regulatory regime priorities two basic things. Expanded access to locations not currently served by a high speed internet and an effort to ensure that high speed internet access is affordable.", "11711 Those are the two main things that the people of Pontiac would want me to say if they were sitting here and able to do it themselves.", "11712 I think with that right mix of an updated regulatory regime and expenditures at multiple levels of government, then we can have small towns who are now suffering jump to that next level of being able to compete and able to take advantage of the fact that they\u2019re -- even though they\u2019re small, that they\u2019re able to participate in a digital economy.", "11713 Merci beaucoup. Thank you for your time.", "11717 Donc anything you can do to make our hearings more popular that\u2019s also very appreciated, apparently because we were dwindling in number of people following our hearings so far.", "11718 So you may have heard what I said earlier in the week, so I\u2019m not going to spend much time today asking you why it\u2019s important. ", "11719 I\u2019m going to take that as a given because you obviously think it\u2019s a given, so I\u2019m more in the mindset okay there\u2019s a problem how do we solve it and I\u2019d like to have your perspective on those things. ", "11720 I noted, for instance, Mr. Graham, you said we need to address this issue quickly and forcefully. Okay how quickly and -- well let\u2019s deal with that. How quickly?", "11721 MR. GRAHAM: If I could have everybody in my riding connected by yesterday I think we\u2019d be getting just about where we need to be.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "11722 MR. GRAHAM: Ummm ---", "11723 THE CHAIRPERSON: We\u2019re working on that.", "11724 MR. GRAHAM: We\u2019re working on that. There\u2019s no -- I can\u2019t give you a timeline. I can say that as fast as we can do it we should try. So how quickly, that\u2019s up to you, that\u2019s up to us, that\u2019s up to the Minister\u2019s office, that\u2019s up to all of us as partners in solving this problem.", "11725 THE CHAIRPERSON: And could you put meat around the word forcefully?", "11726 MR. GRAHAM: If we use the tools we have available to us and we\u2019re here not to talk about the government\u2019s investments; that\u2019s their department. ", "11727 We\u2019re here to talk about the regulatory changes that you can consider in acting, can contemplate, can discuss. ", "11728 And if you want to make regulatory changes that require or encourage different levels of service or better service in different places or investments in different manners, then I think that discussion should be had and I think that the regulatory approach is sort of the hammer approach but it is a forceful tool that\u2019s available to us.", "11738 THE CHAIRPERSON: Someone once said that arm's length doesn\u2019t mean you can't touch, and I'm always afraid that this notion of the CRTC's independence prevents alignment and coordination, and that's certainly not my philosophy. ", "11739 Certainly, the Commission in its actions, it's decisional work, has to be -- act in an independent way, but it has to do so in a coherent and coordinated way more broadly.", "11740 So I was wondering if you could help us? You know, you give the example of Sweden. Unitary states have the advantage of being unitary states and federations, it's even more complicated, particularly then -- and I think many people have recognized that municipal governments play an even more important role in -- than we may have thought of 150 years go, regional municipalities, band councils. ", "11741 I mean, the levels of governments are rich in diversity across the country, and yet in the end there's only one citizen and they get frustrated by this. And even the Commission, although independent, we're still part of the executive, the federal level. And I'd like to have your views. I mean, you must think about these things, because governance of Parliament has been the subject of some debate. ", "11742 In the end, people are wanting action and they're not going to trip up about who's responsible and who's not responsible. But the great risk is that the left hand doesn\u2019t know what the right hand is doing. ", "11743 Could you help us with that?", "11744 MR. GRAHAM: I'll start quickly by saying that our role isn't to connect the right hand with the left hand. Our role here, as Members of Parliament is to tell you what we're hearing. ", "11745 I encourage participation -- interaction between you and the Minister's office to the extent that you are both comfortable doing so, but that's not our role here as Members to speak to you. And that's where I'll start. ", "11746 If Will wants to continue?", "11747 MR. AMOS: I take your point that, you know, Canadians get frustrated when they don\u2019t have the internet access that they see as being a basic infrastructural right, and who feel that they're being left behind or having to leave their small communities as a result.", "11748 You know, the accountability gets spread around in different ways and I think, depending on where one sits, the -- you know, the -- that accountability can feel hotter. You know, the politicians certainly -- I'm going to be held accountable in my riding for the success of expanded internet rollout. I would venture a guess the vast majority of the people in Pontiac don\u2019t know or understand what the CRTC does, and they don\u2019t necessarily know what level of government is responsible. They just want to know that they're going to get internet. ", "11749 So that puts me on probably the hottest seat, and when it comes to you know, building a conversation, I think that the responsible thing for us to do is to engage in the conversation. ", "11750 How the CRTC should engage? You know, there are a lot of different ways, and as you mentioned, there are multiple levels of government that are involved. You know, a public dialogue, through opinion editorials; there's all sorts of ways that Canadians can better understand, you know, what are -- what the regulator is doing, what levers they have, in terms of encouraging the build out of internet. ", "11751 And you know, to the extent that the municipal and regional governments and Indigenous governments can be involved in this process and themselves better understand what they need to do in order to encourage broadband rollout, that's great. ", "11752 But I think the CRTC has a leadership role. Ultimately, that's fundamental, and you know, the federal government has important policy levers as well and funding levers, and I leave that to Minister Bains to lead on. ", "11753 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, because -- and I appreciate but, you know, although there is -- you do represent people with a great deal of expertise because of your own personal backgrounds, and I appreciate that -- but you've also heard a lot from Canadians in your ridings and elsewhere, and I tend to be a -- more than a glass half-full sort of guy, and I want to move to solve problems. ", "11754 The market forces have done a great deal to ensure the availability of broadband services in some places. We're now at the outer edges of where it hasn\u2019t worked, and that's -- it's strange, because we hold public hearings. We're very available. We reach out. We do lots of communications. And what happens is, even though issues may not be strictly within our bailiwick, in our remit and what we're responsible for, from a strict regulatory perspective, we have tons of people coming to us and saying, \"We have this issue.\" ", "11755 From digital literacy to poverty to health and safety concerns in the north, the list goes on, and I'm happy to think that you think we should play a leadership role on this, and we will take it up. But people have to come as well, and when other groups, provincial, federal, territorial -- and that's what I'm hoping that you could at least express some support when we occupy that field that we're not stepping on anybody's toes and that that's, in fact, the right way to do things.", "11756 Because we could -- on peut se regarder comme des chiens de fa\u00efence puis personne bouge, personne fait rien, et puis en bout de ligne, qui qui en souffre? Probablement pas nous parce que nous habitons tous dans des endroits o\u00f9 on a les services, puis on est suffisamment fortun\u00e9s, \u00e9duqu\u00e9s pour bien comprendre comment interagir avec, mais c'est d\u2019autres personnes qui en souffrent.", "11763 MR. AMOS: I want to be careful with what, you know, how I couch my remarks, because I really do want to stay within this box of representing Pontiac and not representing the government. ", "11764 I mean, I think the word \"leadership\" is easily misconstrued. The CRTC has a leadership function as an independent regulator. The Government of Canada has a leadership role in other aspects of investment, in terms of spectrum auction. I mean, there's a series of levers that both the federal government and the CRTC, as an independent institution, have. ", "11765 So I don't think it's a question of one level of -- one governmental entity being perceived as more of a leader than another. I think the more important thing is that we act, and the -- I think it's fair to say that, you know, the CRTC has, you know, among the most sophisticated understandings of how market forces have worked to engender broadband rollout and how market forces have not. And the CRTC is also in a strong position to assess how far market forces can be shaped by the regulatory tools available to assist in a speedy rollout. ", "11766 But I think that the key word here is speedy. You asked earlier how fast? I would agree with my colleague. Immediately.", "11767 Well, I mean when you have -- in Pontiac you don\u2019t just have, you know, median income levels that are tremendously depressed but you have towns that have shrunk by 50 percent, 60 percent and that they continue to go down.", "11768 You have demographics that are trending upwards. Why? Because the youth have left. And the only way to maintain -- to conceive of a strong future for so many small towns is by ensuring that they have the tools.", "11769 You know, back in the day it was a nice paved road. These days I\u2019d say that I have more residents of Pontiac knocking on my door and sending me emails saying we need high-speed internet now than they\u2019re saying please fix the potholes. ", "11770 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. By the way, I had a conversation -- and I know you folks have to get back to pressing matters across the river so I\u2019m going to keep my questions short, but -- or my comments short as well. But I\u2019ve always spoken about chair leadership, not individual or single. And I think that\u2019s the spirit I\u2019m asking the question in. ", "11771 I ask this question of others elected officials, whether they\u2019re municipal, federal, provincial. Filling the gap, whether it\u2019s our regulatory actions or government programs or myriad of activities at even purely provincial level, in the end whether the citizen is wearing his hat as a taxpayer or as a subscriber there\u2019s only one wallet being tapped. ", "11772 And I appreciate you want results now quickly, but the speed at which we act and the objectives to which we work, like, so much speed -- or even, you know, you talked about jitter and latency. And those are real issues, I\u2019m not demeaning them at all; quite the contrary. The experience is affected by them.", "11773 But as we try to go down farther and farther to assure near 100 percent connectivity at the sorts of levels people expect there\u2019s a cost to that. And perhaps building -- I\u2019m wondering to what extent are people willing to contribute to that national vision and contribute financially one way or another to that national vision of a more connected country? ", "11774 MR. GRAHAM: I think there\u2019s a willingness because I think if we invest in expanded infrastructure it will end up costing less for people, not more. And right now the cost of internet in the city is considerably lower than it is a rural area like mine. My connection of 40 or 50 gig a month costs $70 and up. And I\u2019m lucky, my connection works.", "11775 You know, if we have a clear plan, I think people will follow it. Right now the problem is, as I\u2019ve mentioned, at the age of convergence we have three different bills you\u2019ve got to pay to achieve a lower quality signal than your neighbour. The money that is there it\u2019s a matter of spending it properly and figuring out where to direct it, in my opinion.", "11779 I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really, you know, that\u2019s one of the key questions here. What is the appropriate private sector investment? And I think the CRTC is well positioned to evaluate that. ", "11780 THE CHAIRPERSON: The challenge we may have because of -- you may or may not know -- but the vast majority of retail services are now deregulated. In fact, I think of the total amount of tel co\u2019s current revenues 90 percent are deregulated.", "11781 In that environment, what happens is if we put more costs on them they get redistributed probably not to shareholders or bondholders but on rate payers. And is that an outcome that you see? Because politicians are sometimes concerned about income taxes or taxes generally going up. It\u2019s a bit the same thing because it is in the end the same wallet.", "11782 MR. AMOS: I mean, I think we can all agree that taxpayers want to pay the least amount of tax and consumers want to pay the least amount for their internet service. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a given that any additional costs that might be imposed upon industry, whether that\u2019s in the form of, you know, conditions of licence that speak to mandatory basic packages or contribution funds. I don\u2019t think it stands to reason that those contributions would be directly passed to the consumer. ", "11783 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, I respect your optimism. It has not been the practice. ", "11784 MR. AMOS: There are limits to consumers\u2019 ability to pay more.", "11785 THE CHAIRPERSON: Which is interesting because like yourselves we\u2019ve heard from the most vulnerable people in Canada, the poorest of the poor. Some of them have come through great courage to our hearing to tell their personal tales. ", "11786 And they are making choices, extremely difficult choices, between having the sort of connectivity you need for all the reasons you\u2019ve put forward, including their children\u2019s education, their health, participating in society in various ways. And what we would have maybe a few years ago thought hierarchies of needs much great, food and shelter.", "11787 In a sense they are caught. And we have tel cos that have come to this hearing, so we\u2019re hearing that side. And then we\u2019re having other people come to this hearing and say, \u201cOh, CRTC, don\u2019t worry about that. That\u2019s a poverty issue, other people should deal with it.\u201d Because the last thing they want is for us to deal with it because they know that we may actually have an impact on their business.", "11788 So what are your views on that? Is affordability something we should -- or unaffordability should be something we deal with?", "11789 MR. GRAHAM: I think you have a chicken and egg problem. The poverty is exacerbated by the lack of internet connectivity so -- and if you\u2019re going to say the poverty is going to fix itself then they can afford internet you\u2019re just -- when I said at the beginning of my presentation that every year our divide gets a year greater it\u2019s just going to accelerated that, it\u2019s not going to fix it so -- yeah. ", "11790 THE CHAIRPERSON: Very few CEOs have showed up to our hearing. I\u2019m respectful of the people they\u2019ve sent, they\u2019re knowledgeable. But if this is a debate of society where were the CEOs; where are the CEOs on this? ", "11791 Because when we pushed and asked whether they think they have a social responsibility they said, \u201cWell, no, we rather put our money elsewhere.\u201d That\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in because we\u2019re open, we\u2019re transparent, and a number of issues come to our shores. And the part where we have an influence on is actually rather limited. And so that\u2019s -- yeah, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a catch-22 but there is a conundrum there. ", "11792 MR. AMOS: I would simply say that -- and again, just as it\u2019s not my role to speak for my government nor is it my role to speak for the major tel co\u2019s, I will say that I\u2019ve had great conversations with a number of senior executives from Canada\u2019s telecom industry. ", "11793 I do believe that there is a commitment to tackle issues both related to access and related to affordability. I think there have been some examples discussed before this Panel in days past. And I think that, you know, as long as the message is being heard loud and clear that whatever the regulator can do to speed up enhanced access and to create a regulatory system that over time, you know, expands the bandwidth and the megabits that are available to communities as a matter of basic service that\u2019s really important. And to the extent that it\u2019s possible to ensure that there is a basic provision that is affordable, very important.", "11794 So again I don\u2019t know if that takes the form of a basic skinny internet package. I mean, I\u2019ll leave that to the regulator to determine what is possible, but I mean, I can say very simply that the good residents of Pontiac, 110,000 of them, they want this kind of government assistance. And when they -- when I say \u201cgovernment\u201d, what they\u2019re thinking of government is the CRTC, municipal regional governments, federal government, a member of parliament, the whole package.", "11795 So I mean I -- and so I say that in a spirit of collaboration and I hope that our, you know, our comments are at least somewhat useful.", "11796 THE CHAIRPERSON: Before I turn to my colleagues, just a couple of other questions I want to ask you about.", "11799 MR. GRAHAM: I get a lot of complaints in my writing about satellite. And the complaints are cost, reliability and latency. If they can address those issues, it is -- it will become a better and better service. It is certainly part of the solution. If you don\u2019t have anything else, satellite is available, it\u2019s not a negative. It\u2019s part of the mosaic of solutions we have. But I think it has a lot of issues that need to be addressed. I\u2019ll put it that way.", "11805 Then the second step is to set out the end goal, the objective you want to reach. And I\u2019m hearing \u201cwe\u201d want to reach. All of Canada, not just the CRTC.", "11806 Then third you do, after having done both current state, future state, you do the gap analysis. And then based on that gap analysis, the fourth step is to have specific action, some of this will be regulatory actions, no doubt, but there\u2019s a whole lot of actions that need to be taken by other people to reach a potential end state.", "11807 And then proper public policy always results in some evaluation of how well you\u2019re doing at certain times towards filling the gaps and then you adjust your plan.", "11808 I know that\u2019s a huge question and you have to go, but maybe you can help us frame that problem. Take it for given we know what the current state is, help us identify the gaps and the potential future actions.", "11809 MR. GRAHAM: The gaps that I see are on the service side. I don\u2019t know the process gaps that we have. I know the technology\u2019s advancing very, very quickly. In my writing, the main source of Nunavut fighters is wireless, using LTE signals. ", "11810 There\u2019s 1,000 different ways of skinning this cat and I don\u2019t have a really good answer for you. I know that we have to work on it and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to try and figure how to do.", "11811 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Cats are getting a really bad rap at this hearing. We\u2019re trying to herd them and skin them now.", "11812 But anyhow, Monsieur Amos?", "11816 I know that the good people of Pontiac would love for the telecommunications industry players to come and visit our riding and speak to residents about what is possible, what they can do, what opportunities they would like to make available if only there were some government assistance, or if certain measures could be undertaken by regional governments or by, in the case of my riding, band governments as well.", "11817 I mean, there\u2019s nothing that I would like to do more than to sit down and talk about small towns A, B and C with an internet service provider and figure out how are we going to get -- how are we going to go from zero or two-and-a-half or five megabytes and get well beyond that. That\u2019s the conversation I want to have.", "11818 So I don\u2019t -- I prefer not to speak about broad strategies and big questions. I really want to focus in on local solutions. And so my, you know, my invitation is an open one and I look forward to hearing, you know, hearing back from industry on that.", "11819 THE CHAIRPERSON: The problem of the absence of broad strategies is then attention is given not to a common purpose, but louder voices.", "11820 MR. AMOS: Is a suggestion that we\u2019re loud voices but there are others that --", "11821 THE CHAIRPERSON: Not at all. But I mean ---", "11822 MR. AMOS: -- aren\u2019t so loud?", "11823 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, but you know, it does -- there are some people that are off the grid that don\u2019t get to have access to make their point as much.", "11824 And even -- it was striking in this hearing so far. We even have mayors of small communities that are clearly overwhelmed by the issue. So how effective can they be in advancing their needs for their community?", "11825 See, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s not a criticism. It\u2019s more a -- un constat que la capacit\u00e9 pour faire avancer les dossiers est in\u00e9gale. Je comprends que vous, vous \u00eates ici pour parler de -- puis c'est tout \u00e0 fait juste l\u00e0 de parler de vos circonscriptions, mais nous comme institution nationale, on doit penser au-del\u00e0 de -- il faut penser \u00e0 tous les Canadiens.", "11828 Yes, there are capacity issues. There -- I mean, you know, that that\u2019s a reality. But, you know, it\u2019s something we have to -- it\u2019s something that we have to overcome and we need to encourage industry to make that extra effort and to help us figure out what can we do to build a, you know, to build out more fibre. ", "11829 So I\u2019ve had those kinds of conversations with major telcos. What -- you know, can we sit down and what can we do to lay down more fibre? What is a reasonable way of accelerating that? And so, you know, that\u2019s partly my role. I\u2019m taking that initiative. But I know that there will be other government, levels of government who are trying -- going to try to do the same. And to the extent that the CRTC can aid and abet in that effort to bring more communities to the table with industry, that would be really appreciated.", "11830 THE CHAIRPERSON: There\u2019s further rounds of comments, at least one of comment in this proceeding. Hopefully you and your colleagues from rural communities can help us come up -- it\u2019s a very rich record so far and maybe you can help us frame the outcome in this and make it better for people in your ridings but also Canadians across the country.", "11831 I\u2019m going to see if our colleagues -- Vice-Chair Menzies?", "11832 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I thank you for coming today. It\u2019s much appreciated.", "11833 I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet, in this role and previous lives, a number of members of parliament, and they usually have a very, very good sense close to their constituency of what\u2019s going on because their phone rings a lot. ", "11834 And it\u2019s difficult to judge -- I\u2019m guessing that both of you, and your colleagues, have knocked on a great many doors the last eight months or so so you would have a pretty good read on things, and also within the context that in the last decade or so I think we\u2019ve seen public opinion drive public policy more and more directly and not just in Ottawa but in all the provinces and municipalities and that.", "11835 So because we can be very narrowly focused, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of sort of at what level this issue sits in your community. You know what I mean. Is it the first thing people talk about at the door? Are they angry when they talk about it? Are you getting, you know, sort of -- I don\u2019t know -- how hot is the issue I guess, to put it that way?", "11836 MR. GRAHAM: I can\u2019t speak for other ridings obviously, but in my riding it\u2019s number one. There is no more important issue than this issue. And there are highways that need repair, there are lakes that need to managed, there are all kinds of other problems but it always come back to this. Internet is number one. We are not part of the modern world; we\u2019re not part of the modern economy until we get this internet solved.", "11837 And when you say I get a lot of phone calls from my constituents, you\u2019re right, as long as I\u2019m in an area where I have cellphone coverage, I get less calls.", "11838 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Mr. Amos?", "11839 MR. AMOS: I mean, I think I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the number one issue in the riding of Pontiac. The number one issue is job creation and economic stability. But within the context of that major issue, it\u2019s one of the top two or three issues. So it\u2019s -- yeah, it\u2019s a high, high priority.", "11840 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right up there with potholes?", "11841 MR. AMOS: Well, I mean, there\u2019s always going to be a conversation around the most immediate issue, and all politics is local, and sometimes -- I think sometimes the issue of internet infrastructure deployment is -- the importance of it is masked by the fact that it isn\u2019t -- doesn\u2019t seem so local all the time it seems like someone far away has to solve it. If it was a mayor who could wave a magic wand and had the power to do it then you could be certain that that would be -- you know, it would be even hotter.", "11842 So I think it\u2019s partly the nature of the issue that makes it, you know, maybe not seem as hot but -- I mean, we have -- as members of parliament we\u2019re either blessed or cursed with the challenge of managing -- attempting to manage way too many demands and we have to prioritize in extreme ways. We\u2019re prioritizing internet issues. ", "11843 And there are a lot of people within our caucus who feel the exact same way, and that\u2019s, I think, one of the reasons why such significant funds were invested in the budget.", "11844 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But this will ---", "11845 MR. GRAHAM: If I could just add a little bit to that. In my riding, the way we see it, the economic issues, the job issues, those are there, and the internet problem is exacerbated, and we could have a better time solving our economic issues, and our job retention issues, and our youth retention issues if the internet was there. But, you know, the youth get up and they leave because then we don\u2019t have any future because no internet. It\u2019s a loop.", "11846 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It is. We\u2019ll dig around then and look for magic wands.", "11847 Thank you.", "11848 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well -- and you have a few years ahead of you in your current mandates representing your respective ridings and hopefully by the time those first mandates come to an end for yourselves that we\u2019ll have done a good job in addressing most of the issues you\u2019ve raised here today. And by \u201cwe\u201d I don\u2019t mean just us here at the CRTC.", "11849 So I appreciate your participation and hopefully we\u2019re getting you out here soon enough so you can do your other jobs across the river.", "11852 MR. GRAHAM: Thank you very much for doing this. ", "11853 And then, for me, internet is a team sport so ---", "11854 THE CHAIRPERSON: There you go.", "11855 MR. GRAHAM: --- I\u2019m working today.", "11856 Thank you.", "11859 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "11860 I would ask if Mr. Frank Brolly is in the room.", "11861 --- (NO RESPONSE)", "11862 THE SECRETARY: I would now ask Mr. Benjamin LaHaise to come to the presentation table.", "11863 THE CHAIRPERSON: So if you could introduce yourself for the transcript, and go ahead, we\u2019re listening.", "PRESENTATION ", "11864 MR. LaHAISE: All right.", "11865 My name is Benjamin LaHaise, and as a resident of Lanark Highlands Township I\u2019m pleased to appear before the CRTC today.", "11866 Given my background in the technology industry, my experience working with and starting ISPs, as well as deploying my own wireless and fibre last mile infrastructure I feel I can share some insight into the issues that leave residents of my community unserved and underserviced.", "11867 Lanark Highlands is a township located approximately 90 kilometres southwest of Ottawa. It is characterized by hilly terrain mixed with trees and farmland. It is the northwestern most township in Lanark County and it is predominantly rural.", "11868 The concerns surrounding the provision of broadband internet access in this area are quite similar to those brought forward to the Commission by other municipalities. This is to say there are small pockets of served customers in the higher density areas of the county, like the Village of Lanark and the Town of Perth, while just a few kilometres away there are many residents who have no viable form of internet access.", "11869 In my community the missing pieces are the gaps in the so-called last mile infrastructure. Thanks to the efforts of organizations like the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, or ERN, over the last few years and the deployment of ATM based services in the late 1990s and early 2000s Lanark County is relatively well-connected to the incumbents transport network.", "11870 However, despite the work by ERN to improve the access market in eastern Ontario over the past decade, the coverage maps of the Connecting Canadians program still showed that in Lanark Highlands Township 40 percent of households -- that\u2019s 868 out of 2,136 -- remain underserved. ", "11871 For example, from the CRTC\u2019s only broadband internet service coverage map the hexagon on which I reside is shown as covered by fixed wireless and DSL. What the map does not illustrate are the distance limitations of DSL as well as the potentially excessive costs of tower installation for wireless, in some cases as much as $1,200 for a single household and the comparatively meager data caps over the fixed wireless provider.", "11872 Given the technologically constraining nature of the terrain and tree coverage, it is essential for there to be an option for residents to obtain a wireline-based internet service. This must be the case since for so many residents there is no other option.", "11873 If it is accepted that there are some users who can only be served by a wireline technology then it stands to reason that the Commission must make it economically viable for ISPs to deploy fibre in rural areas. Whether these services are provided by the incumbent or by a community-based group the deployment strategy must be economically efficient. That means it must be possible to reuse existing infrastructure wherever possible. ", "11874 Specifically, this necessitates the economic use of existing central offices, transport and support structures in rural areas. The Commission has taken action of this nature in the past to enable the existence of collects through the use of the incumbents copper local loops but similar rules do not exist for a residential fibre access over incumbents\u2019 facilities, even in the case where facilities were built with subsidies and passed right by the doorsteps of the underserved.", "11875 Furthermore, in the case of support structures in rural areas, the costs of permits needs to be both predictable and reasonable. Urban areas measure density in terms of customers per pole, while rural areas are measured in poles per customer. Given the significant benefits the incumbents have exploited over the years for their use of public rights of way, it seems only fair that they be obligated to remove numerous obstacles for other providers to serve rural households where they themselves have chosen not to.", "11876 As mentioned in other interventions, there is a role for community-based organizations in helping to fill the service gaps across the country. Any actions that the Commission can take to assist these organizations will foster growth and improved access in communities across Canada, as no single entity can address the significant gaps in connectivity that exist, by itself.", "11877 Thank you for your time today, and for allowing me to speak before the Commission. I am happy to answer any questions.", "11878 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you very much for being here. ", "11879 Commissioner Vennard will start us off.", "11880 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good morning. Thank you for coming before us today. I have a couple of questions for you here. We've heard about the problem many times about the small pockets of unserved people across our country, and it seems like your community might be -- fall into that group as well.", "11881 You mention that 40 percent of your households, 868 out of 2,136, are underserved. Can you define \"underserved\" for me? Are you talking about less than 5-1? ", "11882 MR. LaHAISE: So in many cases, I mean, there are users who have no option other than satellite or fixed wireless. ", "11883 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. ", "11884 MR. LaHAISE: There are some users who cannot get either. For example, if you have -- live on one side of the road and there's forest on the other side of the road that somebody else owns, you can't obligate them to cut down trees so you can get path to the satellite, to go and get satellite service. ", "11885 Similarly, the height of the trees and even the small valleys and sort of depressions in the area mean that you have to put extremely tall towers up. And once you start getting into a tower that's like, 80 feet tall or so up in the air, you're starting to spend, like, $1,200 to install a tower. If you're getting into those sorts of numbers, you're getting into the point where -- to costs where it's similar to the cost of deploying fibre. ", "11886 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Yes, we've certainly heard that before too, that these pockets seem to be associated with sometimes very challenging geographical features to get around as well. ", "11887 What sort of steps or efforts have you taken, just briefly, to address this? ", "11888 MR. LaHAISE: I've sort of -- I've observed the EORN Process. Owing to certain business restrictions, I wasn\u2019t able to participate in that at that time. ", "11889 What I have done is I have put up my own wireless. I have a bit of fibre up as well and I use that. And along the path that I've put up to service my own home, I've also serviced my neighbours along the way. And sort of, the restrictions to go and be able to go and expand beyond that, given my experience with wireless and such, it's very difficult to obtain or achieve a level of service that I feel comfortable putting more people on the network with. ", "11890 And for example, my main wireless backhaul link, which shoots across the valley to McDonald's Corners, it's about a 3-kilometre link, but I can only get about 30 megabits out of it in the winter, a little bit slower in the summer. And as a consequence, you can only put like, maybe five or six households onto that amount of bandwidth. ", "11891 That whole question of over-subscription is a huge challenge in rural areas. It's even a bigger challenge for the wireless networks because fundamentally, what happens is, the slowest radio connecting to a tower makes service slower for everyone on accessing that radio on that tower. ", "11892 And so from a backhaul point of view, in my initial written submission, for me to cross the last three kilometres to get back to the Bell central office in McDonald's Corners, Hydro 1 has quoted numbers of $70,000 to replace telephone poles. And when you look at that kind of business case, you simply cannot get a return on investment. You cannot get your customers to pay for it for 10 plus years or more. ", "11893 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: What do you see as a solution? Do you see funding of some kind? If it's very expensive, then somebody has to pay. Who do you think is responsible for servicing areas such as yours? ", "11894 MR. LaHAISE: So funding is part of the question. I mean, it's not the sole thing. One of the big challenges for individuals in smaller community groups, smaller ISPs, is that you don\u2019t have access to funding that allows you amortize these costs over the long term. ", "11895 Companies like Bell, Hydro 1, and such are able to do things like issue bonds and such with like, 10, 20-year timeframes for repayment, and so programs that enable that, or at least allow us to work with those providers to address the issues with telephone poles and support structures -- because part of the problem is, out in our area, a lot of the -- 60 percent of the poles are owned by Bell, but a good chunk of the other -- the rest of the poles are owned by Hydro 1. And a lot of those poles were installed back in, like, the 1950s, 1980s, wherever. ", "11896 So they are infrastructure that is at the end of its life, and this is why, when you go and say, \"I would like to go on and add an attachment to these poles,\" that they come back with, \"Well, it doesn\u2019t meet current standards.\"", "11897 After the ice storm in 1998, the Province of Ontario also revised their standards for electrical networks, so again, poles that were installed before then, not all of them are up to date and so that whole adding a new attachment triggers replacement of those facilities. ", "11898 So if I could wave my regulatory wand, I would like to see that some of those costs, where reasonable, are borne by the hydroelectric and the incumbents who own these facilities. ", "11899 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you for that bit of insight. Do you -- what do you see as an actual solution for this? Do you see this something that possibly the Eastern Ontario Regional Network could take a role in locating these areas such as yours -- and we've heard of many of them all across the country --- ", "11900 MR. LaHAISE: Yeah. ", "11901 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- and doing some sort of an extension through there, or what solution do you see?", "11902 MR. LaHAISE: So there's sort of a couple of things in that question. I'll first sort of grasp onto the questions of figuring out where these problems are.", "11903 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure.", "11904 MR. LaHAISE: Given that we have started or that the Commission has just put out the coverage map for Canada, and this map sort of aggregates a lot of data from a lot of sources, if I'm correct. From a rural resident point of view, the hexagon structure is not a good fit because fundamentally, what you, as an individual, if you want to go and look at this map, you want to know how does this map apply to me? ", "11905 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. ", "11906 MR. LaHAISE: Who are the providers who are claiming that they can service me? And so on that question -- and it was also mentioned, I think, in some of the discussions yesterday about discoverability -- is as a rural resident, I think it would be very useful to be able to go in and punch in my address and see who claims they can provide service, who is responsible if there is no service at my address, who is the entity that's responsible for trying to address that gap? ", "11907 And so certainly in the case of eastern Ontario, EORN has already done a lot of work in this area and is in a position where they are able to go and tackle that, to a degree. ", "11908 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm. ", "11909 MR. LaHAISE: That said, the other -- the incumbents, other ISPs, other providers in the area, should be able to contribute their own information into the map and additionally, for customers themselves, they should be able to raise the question -- raise issues where the claimed coverage doesn\u2019t actually apply. ", "11910 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "11911 MR. LaHAISE: So that's sort of on the discoverability and mapping side of things. ", "11912 As for EORN, I think they're in a good position to be able to start to help with the process of filling in the gaps.", "11913 I mean, probably from their point of view the biggest challenge is funding.", "11914 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure.", "11915 MR. LaHAISE: Five hundred (500) million sounds like a lot of money to me as an individual. But if I look at the scope of the problem, having listened to the hearings about the challenges that they have up north, the challenges they have all over the country, it\u2019s not going to go very far.", "11916 So in order to make better use of that money we have to not spend money on the things we don\u2019t have to. So if we can get help, like, coming back to the answer for the previous question. If we can get help from the incumbents, if we can get help from the municipalities, from the hydroelectric companies, from everybody who has sort of a vested interest in the existing infrastructure, and the local organizations, the municipalities so that they\u2019re able to drive and coordinate the construction of this infrastructure I think that would help. ", "11917 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you for that. ", "11918 What were your expectations when you moved out to your -- to where you are? And here I\u2019m -- where I want to go with this is just kind of a few comments maybe on what your expectations were and whether or not you actually expected that. We heard from a lady just off Vancouver Island that they moved into their house knowing that there was not going to be access. And so if you could just comment on that.", "11919 And then the second part would be with respect to small and medium-sized businesses that are in your area, if this is having an impact on them in terms of them participating in the digital economy as well.", "11920 MR. LaHAISE: I actually grew up in the area, so I lived in Toronto for a number of years. And sort of when I moved back to the area I knew what the situation was.", "11921 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. ", "11922 MR. LaHAISE: And I mean that\u2019s why I addressed setting up my own infrastructure. I had initial deployed wireless back in 2006 and it was totally wireless to get from the DSL service to our household. And that didn\u2019t work terribly well so hence the upgrades in recent years.", "11923 But if I go back to what was it like back in the eighties and the early nineties and such, our entire area actually had a very lively bulletin board system in the community. So it used to be we had -- I think at the peak there were about six or seven public BBS\u2019s that were set up, and people would go and use dial-up modems and connect to them. They had message boards they were able -- you know, it was part of FidoNet. ", "11924 I was able to go and send email before we had internet email through these different dial-up networks. We even had the people who ran these bulletin board systems got together and then they all pooled -- because long-distance was very expensive back then so they would pool up their resources together. ", "11925 Systems were set up to make automated phone calls at four o\u2019clock in the morning, pick up our email, and our message groups, and everything from systems in Ottawa and bring those back into the community.", "11926 And so the fact that we had universal access for telephone systems already back then it meant that our communities were on an equal footing with those of the larger cities and regional hubs in the rest of the country. ", "11927 And it was only with sort of the deployment of broadband, as it started ramping up at the end of the nineties and early 2000, that the people -- those of us who are just a bit further, a little bit too far away from the central office began to have that inequality. ", "11928 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. It sounds like it had a bit of a paradoxical effect there.", "11929 MR. LaHAISE: Yeah. ", "11930 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Where it should be connecting you and in fact ---", "11931 MR. LaHAISE: Yeah, we were connected and then suddenly so many of us ---", "11932 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: You\u2019re less connected.", "11933 MR. LaHAISE: --- weren\u2019t.", "11934 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "11935 MR. LaHAISE: Yeah. ", "11936 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: What sort of impact is it having on the economy in your area, the people that are operating small businesses, if you have bread and breakfasts there or other home-based businesses?", "11937 MR. LaHAISE: It can be a challenge. I mean, most of those businesses that are in the rural areas have purchased fixed-wireless service where needed. Some of them purchased satellite. I mean, the bigger challenge though is, like the previous presenters mentioned, you have a lot of sort of brain drain where young people and such, even people who have moved into the rural community, they thought they could do it and then they learn that they can\u2019t live with the quality of internet that they have, that their kids are demanding so much use of bandwidth because the kids want to play video games with their friends, they want to chat, watch videos. So there is an impact but I\u2019m not qualified to say how much of an impact that is.", "11938 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "11939 MR. LaHAISE: But I certainly do see evidence of it being an -- impacting things.", "11940 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, well, those are all of my questions. Thank you very much. ", "11941 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "11942 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. I am interested; you say that you\u2019ve started ISPs and almost been forced into creating an -- working as an ISP within your own area to get the service levels that you require. ", "11943 And you make a point of speaking of access to what in regulatory terms we would call \u201cunbundled network components\u201d that the incumbents are required to make available. ", "11944 We have heard, and you\u2019ve noted, that there\u2019s community groups who have come forward and have become ISPs. It\u2019s a new role for them, it\u2019s a gap. The incumbents have other places they choose to spend their money now, and so we have new people entering the world of ISPs. ", "11945 And I just wonder, to what extent were you able to determine what is available, you know, what unbundling has occurred? How easy was it for you to understand what you could expect to access from the incumbent\u2019s networks? You mentioned central offices, transport, support structures. Was it easy for you to understand what you could anticipate you could or could not access through the existing networks?", "11946 MR. LaHAISE: Yes. Strange person that I am, I have actually read the Bell and Bell Alliance tariffs, almost all of them. And so given what I know about those tariffs and so given what I know about those tariffs and what I know from how they are actually implemented in the real world, Bell is very good at creating tariffs that leave certain things undefined. And so there are tariffs for some of these things. ", "11947 For example, if you want to get business internet service from Bell over fibre, because of the obligations they\u2019ve made or promised to your end and as well as via the tariffs for certain services, you can purchase business-level services. Like, you can purchase 100-megabit or gigabit internet access from them. But the problem is, only at business rates and so you\u2019re looking at hundreds to low thousands a month for fibre access.", "11948 And so if you take a look, like, in one of the unserved areas within Lanark Highlands, they have -- Bell has a remote that provides telephone service. That remote is fed via fibre from their central office in McDonalds Corners. That remote, if you look at it in terms of how many subscribers are within range if you installed DSL and that, it\u2019s a small number. It\u2019s only order of about maybe 30 houses, or reasonably close.", "11949 And so if you look at the feasibility then of purchasing the currently available fibre access and putting up your own (inaudible) equipment there to go and provide service, the unbundled local loops, you can\u2019t get access to them in remotes; that\u2019s one challenge. ", "11950 And you can\u2019t put in, like, a gigabit feed and pay for that on the amount that\u2019s reasonable for 30 subscribers to pay. So yes, there are services but they don\u2019t fit economically into what the reality is in rural areas.", "11951 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Thank you and I\u2019m not sure if everyone -- every one of the community groups or other ISPs are going to read the full tariff as you have. But that was more my question. Like we have spoke of discoverability to understand where facilities exist, and also perhaps a little bit on the literacy side, if you will, to say for those who are moving into the work of closing these gaps, do they understand well what obligations incumbents have to share facilities and networks and so on so. In your case, you believe you --", "11952 LAHAISE: So --", "11953 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- have the information you needed?", "11954 MR. LaHAISE: -- so one of the aspects of one of the ISPs that a friend of mine owns, and I do a lot of work with him, focuses on is helping people to understand what their actual needs are when it comes to technology, what options are actually available.", "11955 So you take somebody like myself, I can drive down a road and you look at the telephone poles and you can see, oh, Bell has their fibre on this pole. They have copper phone lines here. They\u2019re this far from their central office. They have a remote here and whatnot along the way.", "11956 And the thing is, information like this is very hard to discover by yourself. I mean, you can do it if you go out into the field and drive around and have a look. That costs a lot of time and money. In other aspects you can go and use Google Earth, for example, and go and get some ideas of what facilities are out there.", "11957 But the challenge of actually going and knowing what information to look for and knowing how to do it, I think EORN can develop some of that facilities. I mean, they already have. Their level of technical competence now compared to when -- what the project was started back in, what, 2008 or -- so 8 plus years ago, they\u2019ve gotten better, but I think there\u2019s still room to grow and contribute.", "11958 And I think there needs to be some coming together of the groups across the country that want to go and do what EORN has done and learn lessons that people like myself can help them to understand and then go and train people to go out and teach them how to roll out the same model in their own municipalities. I think that that\u2019s one possible model.", "11959 And if you talk to municipalities, if the business case is there and nobody else is willing to do it, they do certainly have some facilities in terms of financing. ", "11960 So I think it\u2019s a matter of enabling that and teaching the municipalities how they can fit into this process and drive the needs of their own local area so.", "11961 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "11962 THE CHAIRPERSON: I believe -- sorry, those are our questions. But I do want to thank you for having participated. The richness of the CRTC\u2019s open process is that we get very diverse and insightful voices from quarters we don\u2019t expect. So thank you very much for your participation.", "11963 MR. LaHAISE: Thank you very much.", "11964 THE CHAIRPERSON: I think we\u2019ll take a mid-morning break at this point because the next panel is pretty big and we\u2019ll let them get organized. So we\u2019re adjourned until 11:10. Donc, on ajournement jusqu\u2019a 11h10.

", "11969 To my right is Suzanne Blackwell, President, Giganomics Consulting; and to Suzanne\u2019s right is Scott Wallsten, Senior Fellow and Vice-President for Research with the Technology Policy Institute, and Senior Fellow with the Georgetown University Center for Business and Public Policy. ", "11970 In the back row starting from my right is Barry Choi, Director Regulatory Economics and beside him is Simon-Pierre Olivier, Director Regulatory.", "11971 We have followed the hearing closely and heard the panel on Monday. We are going to speak to the geographic, affordability and accessibility gaps that have been flagged. But first we want to share some of our initial thoughts on your call for input on a National Broadband Strategy.", "11972 Having reviewed the reports of the National Broadband Task Force and Telecom Policy Review Panel, a National Broadband Strategy should be framed by key principles and we list these in Appendix 1 to our remarks. And because a strategy needs leadership to get results, we propose a multi-stakeholder advisory council to oversee the strategy\u2019s implementation. The council would bring together the many levels of government, industry, consumers and non-governmental organizations.", "11973 The record of this proceeding has much to contribute on how to fulfill our proposed principles. We will expand on these aspects as we turn to our specific proposals in this proceeding.", "11974 Rogers agrees that the definition of basic telecom service should include broadband internet. ", "11975 Rogers recommends that the definition of basic telecom service should include a broadband internet service that provides a connection of no less than five megabits per second download and one megabit per second upload. ", "11976 A broadband connection of five and one is sufficient to support the basic telecommunications requirements of Canadians. The most popular types of online activities, encompassing everything from emailing to watching high-def video, can be enjoyed using a basic five and one connection. ", "11977 Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, requires only a fraction of this bandwidth. This is illustrated by CRTC Exhibit 1. The same bandwidth requirements are true for VRS, which performs well at less than one megabit. ", "11978 Broadband internet service will continue to evolve. And in keeping with that evolution, the Commission should establish a more advanced level of service as a prospective target. Rogers proposes 25 megabits download and 1 megabit upload as a target for all Canadians by 2020. While many Canadians can already receive this higher level of service, extending it to all regions will take time.", "11979 Basic telecom services redefined to include broadband internet are broadly available in Canada, yet there are pockets of unserved and underserved households that remain.", "11980 The challenges facing the North and truly remote places are well known. Rogers also acknowledges that there are locations near larger centres currently served by Rogers which are underserved at this time. We have simply found these locations to be uneconomic for us to serve at this time.", "11981 Many of these unserved areas may soon become served, given the number of recent announcements of government-funded projects. We note that Connecting Canadians is in the early stage of deployment. ", "11982 In the recent federal budget $500 million has been allocated to improving access to high quality broadband internet in rural and remote communities over the next 5 years. And these funds will be matched by the private sector. ", "11983 We have heard other provincial and regional governments describe their own initiatives. One of the key challenges is to coordinate these efforts in ways that maximize the benefits and minimize duplication.", "11984 New satellite-based solutions also promise to greatly expand the capacity and lower the price of advanced broadband internet service across Canada. The threat of new satellite providers is also pushing existing providers to up their game.", "11985 To summarize, Canada\u2019s achievement in broadband coverage is the result of competitive market forces encouraged by past CRTC decisions and government directives. Increased competition has driven private sector investment in wireline, wireless and satellite technologies. ", "11986 Rogers supports initiatives that will continue to foster innovation, investment, and market forces to the greatest extent possible. Canada\u2019s National Broadband Strategy should continue to be based on a market-driven approach that has seen the investment of tens of billions of dollars of private investment. This approach has been very successful. ", "11987 Rogers does not support creating new industry-funded subsidies for extending broadband internet service without knowing whether, or how much, subsidies may be needed. This, as the Chairman suggested, would be like \u201cpouring money into sand\u201d. Instead, any subsidy should be narrowly targeted to where gaps may persist absent funding. The source of the subsidy should continue to be government. However, if the Commission chooses to create another fund, it should do so by re-directing the existing subsidy for local voice service in high-cost areas. ", "11988 Properly updated cost studies will show the subsidy is no longer needed for local voice service. Any obligation to serve should also be applied only in subsidy-eligible areas, consistent with the Commission\u2019s past practice of linking the obligation to where it provides financial support. ", "11989 Other opportunities exist to help industry do more in closing the gaps such as improvements in accelerated capital cost allowance and the terms of access to support structures and rights of way. We also see the CRTC providing information on where there are geographic gaps through enhanced mapping exercises in conjunction with ISED. ", "11990 The Federation of Canadian Municipalities can play a role in having its members input detailed availability data, identifying pockets that can be as small as a street in a 25 square kilometer \u201cserved\u201d hexagon. These outliers are hard to find. This work may not sound exciting but it is required to effectively address gaps.", "11991 Pam?", "11992 MS. DINSMORE: Availability is only useful if the service is adopted. Adoption has many dimensions, of which affordability has received a lot of attention. ", "11993 Canadians receive extraordinary value from a single broadband connection that they can use to engage in multiple forms of communication. The increased functionality should be the point of reference for assessing affordability. Separate payments for voice and television service may no longer need to be incurred.", "11994 Canadians have benefitted from more choice and greater value across a range of broadband service tiers. Rogers\u2019 5 and 1 megabit broadband service costs $33 a month including the modem, equal to only 2 percent of the average monthly income of a low-income household. Bell Canada and many other ISPs have similarly affordably-priced basic broadband service tiers. ", "11995 Competitive market forces will continue to protect the interests of consumers, and it is not necessary to take the extraordinary step of regulating basic broadband internet service prices or packages.", "11996 However, there is an identifiable gap, or digital divide, for low-income households when it comes to broadband internet. Rogers is well aware that low-income households are less likely to subscribe to broadband internet service. Social assistance programs operate under the auspices of provincial governments who are experts in this area. These experts should retain lead responsibility for this type of support. ", "11997 Rogers\u2019 Connected for Success is an affordability support that we have initiated as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility activities, at below cost. Our Connected for Success program is designed to reduce the barriers to subscribing. The program allows eligible residents in community housing organizations to subscribe to broadband internet service for $9.99 per month, with no installation fee or additional charges, and no credit checks. The program provides access to Rogers 10 and 1 megabit internet service. ", "11998 Connected for Success was launched three years ago in partnership with the Toronto Community Housing Corporation. Rogers recently announced that we are expanding this program to other community housing organizations throughout our serving area. ", "11999 Connected for Success has already improved the adoption of internet service, with around 9,000 active participants. However, this represents only 17 percent of eligible residents in Toronto Community Housing, many of whom were already subscribing to Rogers\u2019 internet service. ", "12000 Our experience with the Connected for Success program confirms through a real-life experiment what many surveys have found; the price of broadband internet service is not the only barrier to adoption for low-income households. ", "12001 We do not believe that we know enough to endorse any proposal for a national industry-funded subsidy program targeted to low-income households. Gaps in digital literacy and skills are also substantial barriers to adoption. In the near term, the Commission should allow industry to try a variety of approaches in regard to affordability under their corporate social responsibility initiatives. Encourage and have experimentation. ", "12002 We will be pleased to share our learnings from our Connected for Success program. Other service providers will have their own projects which could contribute other insights. The advisory council could also contribute to learning more about adoption by sponsoring a new Canadian Internet User Survey to be conducted by Statistics Canada.", "12003 Deborah?", "12004 MS. EVANS: In the area of accessibility, Rogers is systematically improving our services and processes for this important segment of the population. We take this issue seriously. Rogers is meeting with representatives of advocacy groups. We have a data-only wireless flex plan. We have introduced a range of handsets with accessibility functions. We have introduced a website specifically for accessibility. We have dedicated customer service representatives to work with these customers to meet their needs. And we take steps to ensure customers with accessibility requirements are automatically directed to these specifically trained CSRs to respond to their inquiries.", "12005 Scott?", "12006 MR. WALLSTEN: Canada has performed well compared to the United States in terms of the availability and adoption of telephone and broadband internet services. This performance is impressive considering Canada has spent only a fraction of what the U.S. spends on promoting universal service availability and affordability. ", "12007 The U.S. has spent $130 billion on universal service subsidy programs, and the Federal Communications Commission recently announced plans to spend even more. Yet, the evidence from several studies is that the programs are costly, inefficient and inequitable. ", "12008 The U.S. programs have had very little impact on service adoption. If the billions of dollars in subsidies do not cause people to subscribe to a service they would not have otherwise, then the programs become inefficient substitutes for general welfare programs. ", "12009 Canada may want to learn from this experience, and not simply copy the flawed universal service programs of the U.S., as proposed by AAC.", "12010 AAC\u2019s Exhibit 2 suggests that its most expensive funding proposal, at $710 million a year, would represent an additional $2.09 per month per household for Canadians. But that would recover only half of their funding request, as shown in Appendix 2 attached to these remarks. Recovering 100 percent would require $4.44 per month per household. ", "12011 In my report, I provided a number of recommendations for the components of a universal service program should the Commission decide to create one. ", "12012 First, a universal service program should be cost-effective to ensure the biggest bang for the buck. ", "12013 Second, it should include evaluation criteria at the outset. This requires setting outcome measures. So a program intended to increase low-income adoption must cause non-connected low-income people to subscribe, not simply lower the price for those who already subscribe.", "12014 Third, consider the full cost of a universal service program, including the economic cost of raising revenues from industry levies that ultimately are borne by consumers. ", "12015 Fourth, because we do not know how to encourage the unconnected to subscribe, any program should first design, run, and evaluate pilot programs before committing to a single, nation-wide program.", "12016 Dave?", "12017 MR. WATT: The Commission can play a vital leadership role by providing critical input to, and promoting, a National Broadband Strategy. Such a strategy would take into account the result of this proceeding on the definition of basic service that includes broadband and future targets for broadband service, as well as information collected about current and persistent gaps that may remain.", "12018 At the same time, the Commission should do its part by ensuring its regulations in the near term strike a balance between pursuing the social benefits of promoting access to high quality and affordable basic telecom service, and the economic benefits of fostering investment and innovation in a competitive market. ", "12019 Thank you for your time, and we are ready to answer any questions you may have.", "12020 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: Merci beaucoup, mesdames et messieurs. Je vous mets entre les mains du vice-pr\u00e9sident des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Monsieur Menzies.", "12021 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Good morning. What I propose is maybe we'll start with what's newest and most strategic, and then probably gradually work down from there and get ever more granular.", "12022 So National Broadband Strategy, you\u2019ve outlined these principles. Can you maybe unpack for us a little bit what you think that would look like? And I'll start with -- so you've indicated, I think, that we would lead it or where do you see leadership coming from or is it a -- anyway, what's the cap? Where do we start?", "12023 MR. WATT: We think that the advisory council needs to be initiated to the leadership jointly of the CRTC and ISED. The model behind our approach here is the National Broadband Task Force, before that, even the Information Highway Task Force. Those were activities that were jointly led, initiated by the CRTC and Industry Canada, that's, as I said, was named at that time. ", "12024 We think that you and the government department, as the -- effectively, the representatives, broadly speaking, of all the citizens of Canada, are the two entities that should play the initiating leadership role. You have the authority to encourage people to obviously actively participate; indeed, to require them to participate. ", "12025 Then both those previous exercises which did excellent work -- and we did hear the Chairman this morning -- in those cases, CEOs of major corporations in this industry were the lead representatives now. They had a cadre of people working on their behalf in the various subgroups but the membership would also obviously include representatives from PIAC and the AAC. ", "12026 We believe since this advisory council, we would be addressing affordability issues as well, that there would be provincial government representation. We think there should be municipal government representation, because we see a major role in this exercise for them, think without this type of joint exercise, we're not certain the problem is going to be addressed in the best manner possible, because you will have a piecemeal approach. ", "12027 We assume -- believe one of the difficulties you face in this very hearing is, we know that for Connecting Canadians, we know where that gap is being closed. Those locations have been identified. They're not all closed yet. They will not close some of them until into 2017. ", "12028 For the recently announced $500 million, that program hasn\u2019t been defined. So say, for example, you were to adopt Bell Canada's proposal, our proposal today, to take funds from the voice contribution fund, which, as we said in our opening remarks, we don\u2019t believe are needed there, first, because I don\u2019t think the cost exceed the revenues, but secondly, because when you provide broadband service, we think you would also be providing that voice functionality at the same time.", "12029 But if you were to devote that money to closing the geographic gap, you -- the two -- the federal government program, your program, could easily be working at cross-purposes. ", "12030 These things do need to be coordinated. Both activities need to know where the gaps are, and as we said in our opening remarks, that's not easy and it's not easy as you've heard earlier here in this proceeding. The people from, I believe, Thetis Island, many are well-served, but a street isn't. It's hard to -- as carriers, it's hard for us to know where that street is. ", "12031 And so a considerable amount of work needs to be done, and it shouldn't be duplicated, and so that, in broad strokes, and I'll turn the mike back over to you. I've spoken for quite some time now. ", "12032 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: That's okay, because we're dealing with concepts, so we almost have to speak conceptually. But if such a framework or body were to be established, given how quickly things are changing, we should probably start pretty soon on something like that. So when would you -- have you -- I'll ask two questions at once here. So have you consulted with others or even casually as opposed to formally, and when would you see this getting underway?", "12033 MR. WATT: In response to the first question, other than within our company, no, we have not consulted with others outside. We -- oh, possibly we should have thought of this concept before --- ", "12034 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: No, that's okay. I just -- eventually --- ", "12035 MR. WATT: --- but we really turned --- ", "12036 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: I know. This is --- ", "12037 MR. WATT: --- our minds to it (inaudible). ", "12038 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: No, this is really quick. I just wanted to know if you --- ", "12039 MR. WATT: M'hm. ", "12040 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: --- had the chance because --- ", "12041 MR. WATT: No. ", "12042 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: Let me ask it this way. Do you think others would be open to the idea? Would it be a tough sell or an easy sell? ", "12043 MR. WATT: Well --- ", "12044 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: Just an opinion of --- ", "12045 MR. WATT: --- nothing is easy. I do not think it would be a tough sell. It's -- it'll be a tough coordination. It will be -- it's something that needs to be done. I think everybody recognizes that something of this nature needs to be done to address this problem properly. ", "12046 We don\u2019t want to undersell the complexity and magnitude of such a council because we know, having participated in the previous ones that there was a lot of infrastructure to a council; there's a lot of participation, a lot of resources involved. ", "12047 But when we're talking about investing billions of dollars in a directed manner, we think that expenditure of those sums warrants such a concentrated effort of this nature, in terms of an advisory council that would make sure that things are being done in a coordinated fashion to a commonly-agreed goal. ", "12048 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: And in terms of the stakeholders who would be part of this, the Stakeholder Advisory Council, just to confirm that you would foresee that to be more or less the general shape of what you might see in an average CRTC process, in terms of the participants, consumer groups, and as well as industry experts and other experts that -- if we were to lead at our discretion, relatively? ", "12049 MR. WATT: Well, we did see -- and I know actually there have -- there has been provincial participation in this proceeding. ", "12050 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: Yes, there has.", "12051 MR. WATT: Actually, there used to be more in CRTC proceedings, but it's good there was provincial participation here. But we would see actual members of the bureaucracy of the civil service of the provincial bodies involved, and the municipal bodies. I know they appear sometimes at hearings, but I think the answer generally is yes, the people that appeared here. ", "12052 I'm trying to think of -- you would have First Nations representation as well. They appear at some proceedings, others they don\u2019t. So it is a broad comprehensive composition to this committee. ", "12053 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. We may revisit some of these aspects later, or feel free to see how they might fit in and -- when we're dealing with other issues. ", "12054 The next place I'd like to go is your views on affordability. Let's start, before we get into the poverty issue, just with the general affordability of internet. Now, you mentioned here that you have a $33 package that's available. Is that in a bundle or stand-alone? ", "12055 MR. WATT: That is a stand-alone offer. ", "12056 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: That's a stand-alone, okay. Do you think that's -- I think most people would look at that as relatively -- as accessible and affordable, as you mentioned a two percent there. But we've also heard here -- we heard last week, particularly of the ACORN panel in Halifax, that they didn\u2019t seem to be able to find a basic internet package available for anything less than $70 or $80, which is a bit of a shift. Well, let me say $65, but you get into HST and that sort of stuff. It was into the $75-$80 range. And some discussion about TELUS's packages on the west coast where I did see they had a $30 package advertised on their website, but when they spoke of it the other day they were more in the range of $60.", "12057 So would you agree that the price that you were mentioning is more of a basic level or is there technologically can you think of any reason why other companies shouldn\u2019t be able to offer an entry level internet package at the same price the $33 you\u2019ve mentioned?", "12058 MR. WATT: Well we don\u2019t obviously serve Halifax through our wired internet service. Our $33 offer is economic for us. It\u2019s a compensatory offer. That\u2019s why I feel comfortable making it broadly available. It is a commercial offer. ", "12059 We -- for a while we did not actually have that speed service at that price point. The way we had evolved we -- most companies we started, you know, 1.5 down and then 3. ", "12060 And we had a 3 megabits per second offer in the market we then up-speeded it; everybody got 6. Then we up-speeded them to 10, then we up-speeded them still further and the price increased as we up-speeded them.", "12061 We found that we were losing a segment of the market and our subscriber growth was not what we wanted it to be. So we introduced this service to aggressively address that market. ", "12062 We promoted -- we promoted where we think it is useful. You\u2019ll ride the Toronto Subway you will see signs for this service, because we think that that is a good place to advertise that type of service. ", "12063 As for others I really can\u2019t -- I shouldn\u2019t speak for their economics, but for us this service is economic and works for us.", "12064 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks. And maybe you could describe the demographic that that\u2019s targeted at?", "12065 MR. WATT: Well it\u2019s -- it is targeted -- it\u2019s really targeted to two demographics. It\u2019s targeted at the lower income demographic and it\u2019s targeted at the light user demographic as well, because many people have a single computer and they can obviously watch everything they want at 5 in 1 and so that\u2019s quite sufficient for them. ", "12066 They don\u2019t want to pay a higher price to get more speed.", "12067 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thanks. ", "12068 MR. WATT: They maybe -- they can well afford to do that but do not want it. ", "12069 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, but it\u2019s interesting to learn about and the fact that it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s economic for you in terms of that, because it does give us some perspective on other issues.", "12070 So your Connected program, can you tell us about the genesis of that and -- I mean I\u2019m aware of the fact that a couple weeks ago you announced you were expanding it, as I mentioned, and that\u2019s good to see too.", "12071 But tell me why it started, when it started, just so I understand for the next questions what its background is.", "12072 MS. DINSMORE: Sure. Thank you, Commissioner Menzies, and I\u2019m happy to address that, the background of the program.", "12073 Under our former CEO, Rogers had a program under our corporate social responsibility banner all about youth and education.", "12074 And we were aligned with Boys and Girls clubs and we had after school programs and we got very familiar with some of the shortcomings that these youth faced in terms of access to broadband. ", "12075 We also were mindful of the Internet Essentials program that had been launched by Comcast in the U.S., as a result of the Comcast NBC merger.", "12076 And looking at that we knew that we couldn\u2019t offer the exact same kind of program as them, because in the states there was a school lunch program that effectively acts as the \u201cmeans test\u201d and in Canada we don\u2019t have a school lunch program.", "12077 Our major accounts folks were -- provide service in Toronto Community Housing in Toronto, as well as other community housing developments or organisations. ", "12078 So we had contacts at TCH and it looked like to us that was a good place to start because TCH offers their tenants the opportunity for rent geared to income, which effectively means that if you can\u2019t, that you only pay 30 percent of your income in rent and the rest we provide -- the subsidy is provided by the government to the housing -- the not-profit housing organisation and that helps subsidize the rent of the tenants in the units. ", "12079 So because the means test is already done there, we looked at that as being a good way for us to get in and try this program. ", "12080 So we did our work through 2012 into \u201813 and launched in our very first building with Toronto Community Housing in August of 2013. ", "12081 Now Toronto Community Housing has 53,000 units that are rent geared to income. Ninety-two (92) percent of the units are rent geared to income, so 8 percent of the units the tenants in the units would not qualify for the program, by 92 percent did, so we thought that was a pretty good start.", "12082 And we thought that we would use this as a test bed, a place to learn and following that we would see whether it was the kind of program that could be rolled out more broadly. ", "12083 As it happened we were able to rollout more broadly prior to the start of the hearing, which as you would understand, obviously there\u2019s a lot of coordination and work that goes on behind that. ", "12084 It was really a happy coincidence that these two things dovetailed at the time they did and as you will find out, we will be rolling the program out to both New Brunswick and Newfoundland in the near term.", "12085 We have partners in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The largest public housing operations there are actually run by the governments of each, so those are our partners. ", "12086 And we otherwise have signed up, I think, 21 partners in Ontario now, outside Toronto Community Housing, since we have done our announcement on the rollout. ", "12087 So we\u2019re very pleased with it. We seem to be getting a lot of enthusiasm and we will definitely see our numbers grow, but obviously the pool of RGIs, rent geared to income units, will increase from 53,000 to 150,000. ", "12088 So there\u2019s a much bigger pool now for us to offer the service to.", "12089 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So nothing hints more directly at the fact -- at the complexity of this issue then the take rate that you\u2019ve indicated for that program, which I think it 17 percent -- 16-17 percent.", "12090 What can we learn from that or what have -- have you been able to discover? I expect folks have drilled into that a little bit to find out what\u2019s going on there.", "12091 MS. DINSMORE: Yes, the 17 percent number if the number that represents the number of units in that 53,000 -- I mean 53,000 number that have actually taken the service. So that\u2019s about 9,000 on 53,000. ", "12092 This program is a program targeted at affordability, not so much adoption. So for us we know we have that 17,000 number, because we know that out of 17,000 unit number. We know otherwise that we are penetrated at 30 percent in Toronto Community Housing. ", "12093 Obviously that leaves 70 percent who are neither taking Rogers\u2019 commercial offers or our low income $10 offer. ", "12094 As to the remainder, we have competitors in those buildings. They may be wholesalers, they may be facilities based, but we do have competitors and one could posit potentially that they have half the building otherwise. ", "12095 So in terms of reasons why we have not got greater adoption, much as we don\u2019t have the answer for you I can certainly throw it to Scott who can talk to you about adoption at large and what are the factors there.", "12096 We know from the IPSOS Reid Survey that we filed with the Commission of the 250 people that respond to that survey only a third of them cited cost as the barrier and the other barriers were relevance, usability. So there are other reasons why people choose not to adopt. ", "12097 But the 17,000, just to put it in perspective, doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of the building or the rest of the housing organisation that those tenants are not -- don\u2019t have a broadband connection.", "12098 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sure. There\u2019s no assumption on my part that it goes to the effected ---", "12099 MS. DINSMORE: Yeah.", "12100 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Effectiveness of the program. I think it goes more to the complexity of the issue, and -- that\u2019s my instinct anyway. You can dispossess me of it. ", "12101 But just a -- and we can get into that in a second, but just to be clear, the competitors in the building are they offering similar rates or are people choosing to pay higher rates, so far as you know?", "12102 MS. DINSMORE: To the best of our knowledge ---", "12103 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Nobody else is offering it for $10, in other words?", "12104 MS. DINSMORE: To the best of our knowledge, no one else is offering it at $10.", "12105 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And the other quick one is, to what extent is -- what are the -- are there programs available or where do people get the equipment to ---", "12106 MS. DINSMORE: A good question.", "12107 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- access the internet?", "12108 MS. DINSMORE: When the program began we were in partnership with Compugen and there was a program whereby refurbished computers were made available at $150 per computer. We no longer are in that partnership, for various reasons. But we do identify for all of our partners places in each province in a city that we\u2019re in where they can get refurbished computers, and the price of those range from $150 to $250.", "12109 So, for example, in both Newfoundland and St. John\u2019s we have identified where new tenants on the program can go and purchase those computers, and the price would have been similar to what we were getting with Compugen.", "12110 DR. WALLSTEN: So it\u2019s interesting, I think, the response that Rogers has had in its Connected for Success program is very similar to that that the FCC found in these pilots that ran for its lifeline reforms, our low income support program. ", "12111 It -- before doing these reforms, which recently passed, they worked with 14 ISPs to do experiments to see how low income people -- low income people who are not connected would subscribe to different types of plans, and each company involved very different things, you know, they would have different prices, they would include discounts on different types of equipment, they would include digital literacy and different options around that, and some of these were, you know, randomly controlled trials. These were really carefully thought out both by the FCC and the companies involved. ", "12112 And, remarkably, across -- in 12 of the 14 companies -- the two exceptions were in Puerto Rico, which is a little different -- they got only a tiny fraction of the sign-ups they expected. On average they got 10 percent of the number of subscribers that they had expected. They expected in the thousands and they got in the hundreds. And this was a puzzle across the experiments.", "12113 I mean, it\u2019s certainly true that the cheaper plans got more subscribers, as one would expect, and that\u2019s consistent with the surveys and everything. But also consistent with the surveys in this experience is that we really don\u2019t know how all these factors work together, because this was not the problem that they expected to see. And it\u2019s still kind of a puzzle why this result happened. ", "12114 And I\u2019m -- I\u2019ve found myself perplexed that we got this result. And the FCC unfortunately sort of didn\u2019t know what to do with it. But we see that in the surveys where people sort of list a host of reasons why they don\u2019t subscribe in this percentage of eligible subscribers who connected -- who subscribed to Connect for Success and in the FCC\u2019s pilots.", "12115 So it\u2019s a remarkably consistent result and we just don\u2019t know why.", "12116 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "12117 When it comes to this issue of poverty, in terms of that, you\u2019ve indicated here, but I just want to confirm, do you think that\u2019s an appropriate issue for the CRTC to be addressing on its own, or do you see it being an issue that could be addressed within the Advisory Council group?", "12118 MR. WATT: We do not see it as an issue that the CRTC should address alone. We do see it as an issue that should be addressed in the Advisory Council.", "12119 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "12120 MR. WATT: If I could just add, speaking about the Advisory Council again, it was pointed out to me that I actually -- I referenced the Information Highway Report and the National Broadband Task Force Report but the other document that we drew on was the Telecom Policy Review Panel Report. I believe it came out -- it was initiated 2005-2007. And it also had an extensive discussion and a recommendation to this affect in it.", "12121 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "12122 Let\u2019s touch next on service availability challenges that -- I mean, you touched on it in your oral remarks -- in areas that are really comparatively non-remote. I tend to refer to them as semi-rural and that sort of stuff. And you said it -- you indicated that it wasn\u2019t very exciting work, but I think it\u2019s an exciting challenge anyway, but that says more to how my personality has developed in this role than anything else.", "12123 You don\u2019t want to subsidize that, right, that issue -- that\u2019s my take of your interventions. So -- but you do indicate an understanding that subsidy may be necessary in high cost serving areas, right. And what I guess I\u2019m trying to get my head around is these areas, these fill-in-the-gap areas, they must be non-economic in some way otherwise they would have been served, even though -- or are they just turns that people don\u2019t take that just get missed?", "12124 MR. WATT: Well, I have listened to a lot of the discussion and the -- for example, the location outside Milton, and these are -- they\u2019re close to urban areas but they are sparsely populated. They are long loop length, or fibre runs, or cable runs. And you\u2019re absolutely right it\u2019s not economic for us to go there on straight economic terms. ", "12125 It\u2019s -- you know, for example, in just rough numbers, if we\u2019re building into a new location today you\u2019re typically -- and people want -- they would want fibre. Just a round ballpark number the kind you\u2019re looking probably at $2,000 a home, and that\u2019s in a fairly suburban setting. ", "12126 Say, Rogers gets 50 percent take-up on that service, so that for subscribing home you\u2019re looking at $4,000, and leave aside operating costs going forward, they were able to sell $100 package into that home, we\u2019re getting about $40. So you multiply that times the months and you will see that your years you\u2019re into a fairly lengthy payback even on an undiscounted basis. ", "12127 So when we look at that and then we -- the problem is always we have a finite amount of capital. And some of these locations may actually pass the economic hurdle but then they are -- go into a hopper where they\u2019re compared against other projects and they very frequently fall off the bottom. So there are some that are absolutely uneconomic, some that are marginally economic.", "12128 The other consideration we have is -- well, a number of them. One, often we think we\u2019re probably not the lowest cost provider. We can have a situation where we go into these areas -- and we do believe that satellite service is going to be an effective -- very effective competitor, certainly for data. We recognize there are latency issues in terms of voice, and until low altitude satellites come -- and they are coming -- North Telesat launching their prototypes next year, et cetera -- I won\u2019t go into that. But for us there is an issue as to whether we would be competitive in the long-term in addition. ", "12129 And then -- and it gets very complicated here because you might leap to the conclusion well this is a good location for a subsidy and we actually think it is, but then we think, if somebody\u2019s going to get a subsidy at some point to serve this location, do we have wanted to start to build and compete with subsidized dollars or, probably more accurately, should we wait? Should we wait and then bid on that program ourselves, which would improve our economics.", "12130 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It reminds me of the Ronald Reagan quote, \u201cIf it moves tax and it if stops moving, subsidize it.\u201d ", "12131 But the argument there is that, I mean, people who live, you know, two kilometres away from people who are well served and can\u2019t get that service because of the lack of economics, they would have a legitimate argument to say well, you know, make them. You know, they -- the CRTC -- I have a telephone because the CRTC says I must. I -- internet is equivalent to telephone now. So why wouldn\u2019t that make sense? Because waiting, obviously, the issue is -- they have presented it to us is they are falling further and further behind. And as society moves forward, all of a sudden their kids can\u2019t keep up with their homework. They can\u2019t work from home. Their employer expects them to work from home. The education system expects them to educate their kids on the internet and that sort of stuff. And the world is changing very, very quickly. ", "12132 So let me ask it this way, if we were to subsidize it, without you agreeing to that, how would you suggest we subsidize it?", "12133 MR. WATT: If I could take maybe just one minute before answering that. ", "12134 I think, you know, when you look at the very expensive locations for the many places for even voice service, we\u2019re special projects. You know, the obligation to serve really extended to a reasonable distance from where the facilities already existed. There really wasn\u2019t an obligation to build. So it speaks to actually targeted directed dollars going to expand even the voice network.", "12135 Secondly, we -- well, if we\u2019re to do that, we\u2019re in a competitive market. We\u2019re -- we sit nicely in this room with Bell and Telus and the others, but in the marketplace it is a vicious competitive battle.", "12136 In addition to that, we are trying to keep our prices as low as possible for the broadest array of people. We\u2019re trying to make the Canadian economy economic. We will, to the extent we can. If we are required to subsidize we do. It\u2019s been mentioned here many times. Ultimately, will be reflected in consumer prices. ", "12137 And so now coming to your question, how would you do it? Our recommendation is if you feel that government subsidy is not going to do the job, that targeted money, that you should redirect the voice contribution. ", "12138 So with that money set aside, we think you then are into, as Bell was describing, a program likely similar to Connecting Canadians where you\u2019re not trying -- you don\u2019t want -- you want private money to be combined with that money, so true, real economic dollars from us. You would have a bidding process and award the contract to the person seeking the least amount of money.", "12139 There\u2019s been a lot of discussion, I know there was lengthy discussion about how you would do that and setting up auctions and so on and so forth. We participate in auctions. In fact, we\u2019ve contributed over $5 billion in auctions over the past 15 years to the federal purse, which, you know, raises another issue for us as to why some of that money couldn\u2019t have been used to extend service. But leave that aside.", "12140 But you can have an auction as simple as a single bid sealed envelope bid for a location when the terms have been specified in terms of what the price would need to be and what the service characteristics would need to be. It is not -- it\u2019s not something that necessarily takes years to set up and a lot of dollars.", "12141 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. So the reverse --", "12142 MR. WATT: Now --", "12143 COMMISSIONER MENZIES -- the reverse ---", "12144 MR. WATT: -- having said that, Scott may tell me in the United States they found they couldn\u2019t do that. But I don\u2019t think that ---", "12145 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But a reverse auction process appears sensible to you? I mean, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s -- well, I can\u2019t speak for all of my colleagues, but I mean, we all approach these hearings with an open mind and must. But it\u2019s not my first instinct, people can talk me out of it, to come out of here making everybody\u2019s internet bill go up. It\u2019s to figure out how to fix -- because it is a very good system overall. And this combination of market forces and targeted government funding has built a very good system. But there are these problems.", "12146 And ideally, we can come out of here with solutions that fix what\u2019s broken but don\u2019t try to fix what\u2019s not broken. You know what I mean? So that\u2019s what I\u2019m ---", "12147 MR. WATT: Well, we are -- we\u2019re trying to provide a solution that would not increase consumer\u2019s bills. That $110 million voice contribution fund is already being collected. It\u2019s already being reflected in bills. So we are proposing a redirection of that, which in turn would generate additional private money. And as we said, we recognize that voice is still very important. We believe that voice can be provided over broadband, and in fact, the Commission has recognized that and you have a 9-1-1 obligation and rules around VoIP service, both fixed and nomadic VoIP.", "12148 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you.", "12149 Let\u2019s move on to -- excuse me -- I just want to touch on upload speeds for a minute. Some of the accessibility groups talked about the need for synchronicity, and to a greater or lesser extent, certainly higher upload speeds than most of the ISPs have been proposing. Sorry, I\u2019m just trying to read my writing for a second.", "12150 Can you assure us that five and one is capable of meeting those needs? We asked the other day about VRS, for instance. We were given, you know, that maximum service is about 1.3 I think for uploads and that. And particularly once VRS rolls -- and VRS is the best example because once it rolls out it\u2019s going to be a 9-1-1 service too. So -- and I\u2019m nervous about one being enough to make that assured.", "12151 MR. WATT: Well, when we appeared at the VRS proceeding, my recollection was that certainly they were really looking at 256 kilobit per second was adequate to provide the service. If you look at Sorenson\u2019s website, the largest provider -- I believe it is the largest provider of VRS services in the United States. They said they have a 256 kilobit per second requirement. So we think it is sufficient. We think you can tell from just watching video yourself today that you have certainly approved the, typically with the cable provider, you will have a one megabit per second upstream, that the video is very good.", "12152 I -- now you may well be coming to this in the 9-1-1 proceeding you\u2019re going to be having later, but it may -- you may well know more about this than me. But I don\u2019t think VRS is a 9-1-1 functionality because my belief is with VRS you\u2019re actually -- you\u2019re scheduling your appointments for -- with the video relay centre. And so I\u2019m not sure in an emergency situation that they are -- it was contemplated that they would be directly connected to the peace aps. I thought ---", "12153 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I think that ---", "12154 MR. WATT: Really, I thought text 9-1-1 was --", "12155 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, I --", "12156 MR. WATT: -- addressing the issue.", "12157 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- understand. I believe that\u2019s their aspiration.", "12158 MR. WATT: Okay.", "12159 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So I\u2019m expressing that not as the institution\u2019s view, but from --", "12160 MR. WATT: Okay.", "12161 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- that is their aspiration. Okay.", "12162 Date of usage allowance. You were fairly clear that you don\u2019t see that as something we should contemplate, but what\u2019s the point of setting a five and one target without setting some sort of minimum data usage standard? Because as we\u2019ve heard from many groups in, I guess, often high-cost service areas or various plans it becomes an issue. ", "12163 MR. WATT: Yes, our 5 down/1 up service, our $33 plan, it has a 25-megabyte cap. But we do understand the issue that once you get above a certain speed, and we would say as we\u2019ve indicated here today, five and one is, in our view, a really sufficient speed for definitely a basic telecom service requirement. ", "12164 But frankly, your issue is the cap, the usage at that speed. We think 25 megabytes provides a standard that could be met across the country, bearing in mind that the definition here is to be available to all Canadians and to be achievable. And we think it is useful.", "12165 MS. BLACKWELL: Commissioner Menzies, if I could just add. I know that many parties have cited standard speeds, standards in other jurisdictions, and my understanding is that in most part when I look at the United Kingdom and the United States that those speed standards generally don\u2019t have a cap associated with them. ", "12166 I know that usage levels amongst them on a median level is something that would have to be a moving target if you set it. So I think other jurisdictions have gone forward with targets that don\u2019t have a usage amount associated with them.", "12167 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So how do you manage people with data cap issues? How do you manage your customers? Through this we\u2019ve heard various offers for various -- and various approaches and that sort of stuff and, anyway, how do you manage it?", "12168 MR. WATT: Well, what we do is for a customer who has a byte cap they receive a notice, pop up the next time they log on saying you have hit 75 percent of your usage. You get another when you hit 100 percent of your usage. And then once you\u2019re over the cap then you\u2019re billed additional usage charges. ", "12169 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But I mean, what happens if they keep going over? I mean, they\u2019re going to get mad at you sooner or later. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the goal of your association with them, right?", "12170 MR. WATT: No, we do -- we track these people when they go over and we contact them. And we generally try to convince them to take an unlimited plan. Or in the case if they had been at a lower byte cap and don\u2019t need unlimited, there are certain thresholds, we try to -- we call it -- some people would call it \u201cupselling\u201d we call it \u201cright sizing\u201d. But we try to fit the customer to the plan that will provide him the least bill relative to the usage that he wants to consume. ", "12171 So in other words, you go over your cap and you pay the additional usage charge for gigabyte you\u2019re paying more. You can, in many instances, move up to a higher package with a higher byte cap and pay less than you -- more than you would on your plan, if you didn\u2019t exceed usage, that you were on but less than what you\u2019re paying with the plan you were on and the additional usage charges. So we try to right size the customer. ", "12172 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. And do you contact them?", "12173 MR. WATT: We contact ---", "12174 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You contact them if they\u2019re ---", "12175 MR. WATT: --- them if they are going over, yes. ", "12176 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: To educate them on how to manage it if they are going over consistently, or do you contact them after one incident? ", "12177 MR. WATT: We have a series of tools actually on our website in terms of how to optimize, how to manage your usage, and what you should do. And encourage them, as we say, to actually prompt there to phone us. But we do also, when a person is over consistently, we contact them.", "12178 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. While I\u2019m here on this page I have an undertaking to request. Would you please provide us with an example of your standard retail home internet service agreement and any associated documents such as privacy policy that go with that?", "12179 MR. WATT: Yes.", "12180 ", "UNDERTAKING", "12181 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "12182 THE CHAIRPERSON: On that question I\u2019ll point out that somebody was wondering why we were asking those sorts of questions when they\u2019re publicly available. ", "12183 We\u2019ve got rules of evidence and it\u2019s in fairness to everyone. I know you understand this in front of us, but I saw somebody make a comment to that effect. Well, we can\u2019t just be going on a frolic of our own finding evidence here and there. That\u2019s not fair to parties. So what\u2019s on the record is what is on the record. ", "12184 So I just wanted to clarify that for the less informed. Thank you.", "12185 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. When you talk about proposed five and one as the basic standard and you propose a future target for 2020 of, I think, 25, I just want to be clear, do you suggest that the future target be an aspiration or that it be defined in some way?", "12186 MR. WATT: Well, I think we saw it -- I\u2019m not sure of the difference between the aspirational. It\u2019s the target. It\u2019s in the similar fashion that the target was set at 5 down/1 up in the 2011 decision. We would see written in the decision that the target is 25 down/1 up in five years. ", "12187 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: In 100 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent, or ---", "12188 MR. WATT: Well, again ---", "12189 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- leave it to us?", "12190 MR. WATT: --- this I think is why it\u2019s why we call it a target. Because we think we collectively, as industry regulator government, as you mentioned earlier, have done a good job in advancing internet in this country with increasing speeds but not everybody can get five and one today. So think we want to try as hard as we possibly can. I think our aspiration probably would be to try and be at 96 percent in five years at 25 down and 1 up, same as we are sitting here today at 96 percent 5 down/1 up. We think this time may well be absolutely achievable. ", "12191 We heard Xplornet say they plan on offering 25 down/1 up satellite everywhere. We also heard though, you know, B.C. Broadband Association and there are areas where the satellite signal cannot get through. So to say all, we may not be able to get to all.", "12192 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, I understand. Actually, I recall when the five and one was set it was considered to be a stretch objective and had feedback from people saying, \u201cYeah, like that will ever happen.\u201d And then it happened very fast in most places. But, yes, 100 percent is a noble aspiration but it does fall into aspiration at that point. ", "12193 So what are your thoughts on a model that would include a minimum service level of say five and one, but also that there be higher optional service levels available; you know what I mean? Like, the minimum standard be that five and one folks be able to get five and one at a certain affordability rate and but they also have access to eventually higher services or unlimited plans or something like that. ", "12194 It\u2019s kind of proposed in the OneWeb intervention.", "12195 MR. WATT: Okay, I\u2019ve read the One -- well, my initial answer was going to be we have a wide range of speeds, you know, 15, 30, 60, 100. We have a lot of service packages in the market that people obviously can move up to. On a broad basis across the country can that be done everywhere? I don\u2019t know.", "12196 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Their suggestion is that subsidy apply to the 5 and 1. ", "12197 MR. WATT: M'hm. ", "12198 COMMSSIONER MENZIES: But then, that also -- but that our actions would also indicate that while subsidy applies to 5 and 1 and they get 5 to 1, they may also have access to others. ", "12199 MR. WATT: I'm going to ask Ms. Blackwell. She, I think, knows more about the record than I do on this matter. ", "12200 MS. BLACKWELL: And I have read the OneWeb; I believe it was a response to one of the interrogatories and they do talk about a 25 down 5 up as a service level that they believe they can offer. ", "12201 And I think in terms of what you're suggesting, in terms of a model, it may be that by setting the definition of basic telecom at a 5 and 1 and combining it with that target, the 25 and 1, at least, you know, we've put out in the submission, that does give you that signalling to the consumers that they should be expecting to have those other options. ", "12202 And I will also note that in one of the -- as I think we're in violent agreement that there has been a lot done from private sector and competition -- is that if you look at how quickly the rollout of even 100 megabits per second service has happened in this country, in 2010, less than 20 percent, I believe your monitoring report -- less than 20 percent had access to 100 megabits service, and in 2014, that was over 70 percent. ", "12203 So I would say that you can inform your goals and that kind of model with the information you have about what's -- what is available, and I do believe that a very large proportion of consumers do have those options. ", "12204 But when we get into the tricky part of saying everyone should have both a minimum of 5 and 1 and also something higher, then are you not suggesting that everyone should have the something higher? I just -- it's -- you said a minimum is your -- what you define as basic, so is it something like an advanced goal as well? ", "12205 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That's the proposal --- ", "12206 MS. BLACKWELL: Right. ", "12207 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- as I recall it. I'm -- I know I'm not as quick on memory, because Mr. Watt could remember what VRS was -- usage were from a hearing two and a half years ago, so I'm a little intimidated by that. The -- as I recall it, the idea was that there would be a basic standard of 5 and 1, to which subsidy would apply.", "12208 MS. BLACKWELL: Right. ", "12209 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right? And that the -- it would also include, you know, analogous to the telephone thing, access to enhanced services in the sense that they would, by a certain time, have the option to choose higher level of non-subsidized services. ", "12210 MR. WATT: Well, I think that's actually right. That's what -- because the satellites would be in the sky. As I understand their proposal, they -- in order to launch the constellation covering Canada, they were -- said, \"We will cover this certain area, $5 per household.\" And with that commitment, customers in that area would also -- they would also have the ability to take a 25 down 5 up -- they call premium because presumably at a higher retail price than the lower one -- so basically saying, \"Look, if we can get the satellite there, we'll provide 5 and 1 at a certain -- with a certain subsidy and because the satellite is in the air, we also will provide a premium service at a higher price and people could, depending on their means and wants, avail themselves of that service.\"", "12211 But I think, in our context, Rogers, we -- well, it's direct analogy, but we have our lower speed offer targeted at a certain segment, but many touches here, we believe even Toronto Community Housing, there are people there who internet is very important to them. They are subscribers to Rogers at their 60 megabit per second service. So they're not -- they -- the $9, the subsidized service doesn\u2019t meet their needs and it's -- internet is important enough to them that they pay the commercial price. And so all this to say that one size doesn\u2019t fit all. ", "12212 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, understood. ", "12213 When you were referring to it today and before when you were talking about developments, new technologies in satellite and how that's inspiring more response from legacy satellite providers, I guess, can you just specify, were you talking about, for instance, Xplornet? Were you talking about low-orbit, low-latency or all of the above? Or was there -- is there something else there that you were thinking of that maybe I'm unaware of? ", "12214 MR. WATT: What we were thinking of there, specifically, was actually the advent of low-altitude satellites, and you know, our belief would be that the interest shown in Canada is inspiring Telesat to move, by others. It's inspiring Telesat to move quickly. There will be a battle over getting slots. There'll be a battle to be in the market first, and Telesat has leapt forward. It was launching the two prototypes. ", "12215 Our view is, had an entity such as OneWeb not, you know, publicly announced they are hoping to be in Canada by 2019, that it might have been a slower rollout. So we think this type of competitive pressure is moving things along and that's, as we said in -- the wording was the threat, even the threat of someone coming in is getting people to move quickly. ", "12216 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Just to touch on the speeds again, and I might come back to it again, because it's connected to so many things. If 5 and 1 is appropriate, I've -- just, I mean, your \"Connected for Success\" program is 10, right, and your $33 package is 10, right or is it 5? ", "12217 MR. WATT: The $33 package is -- it's 5 megabits down --- ", "12218 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It is 5?", "12219 MR. WATT: --- 1 up. It's 5. It's the commercial available offer. ", "12220 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So what's the roadblock, though, between -- I mean, CCSA yesterday, they said, \"It's no big deal if it's 10 versus 5.\" What's the -- is there a price point on there that we're missing? I mean, why would 10 be any pricier for you to -- for people to provide than 5? ", "12221 MR. WATT: Well, 10 is -- at that level, it is pricier because you're putting more bits through at a peak period, so it's putting -- sort of driving incremental costs, we would say. ", "12222 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Is it more a peak period management issue that you're looking at? ", "12223 MR. WATT: Well, we really don\u2019t -- no, our peak management, what we do is, we have our byte caps and that will govern people's behaviour so they're not all unlimited. We don\u2019t throttle or traffic shape, shape our traffic. But like, so your question is, if you're offering \"Connected for Success\" at 10 megabits per second, why is it the commercial offer at 10 megabits per second rather than 5? ", "12224 I think the answer is that the broadly available commercial offer is exactly that. It is an economic offer. It is what we can provide economically at a price point of $33. Five, we want to be quite clear, the \"Connected for Success\" is a heavily-subsidized program that we provide in the community housing organizations. It does not come near to covering its costs. ", "12225 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. At the risk of having asked this before, if we had slightly or touched on it --- ", "12226 MR. WATT: Sorry, just -- I hate to interrupt, but just a good point was brought up. It's the thing and broadly reference that really, to us, I think, in the broader context of the basic service definition that will apply across the entire country, I said our incremental cost, additional incremental cost, may not be that large, 5 to 10. But it's been pointed out to me that's like, probably not the case, in non-urban areas, more remote areas that the incremental cost going from 5 to 10 would be a substantial cost increase. ", "12227 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, maybe one more question and then, with the Chairman's indulgence, we might eat. ", "12228 The -- just to confirm, in terms of two areas, digital literacy and adoptability, where -- how do you think those are -- where does the responsibility for those issues lay?", "12229 MS. DINSMORE: In our own program, we did have initially ideas around digital literacy and you know, I think there's a couple of things. One, we're probably not the best place to provide those kinds of educational programs to the target audience. We did have some events within the housing operations in the evening. They were not well attended. It didn\u2019t seem to be something that was catching on. ", "12230 I think it's really -- and I know TELUS referenced MediaSmarts as one organization that is in this field, but I think there others who are more expert at this, and if we come back to the notion of an advisory council, we would certainly want to have government and non-profit organizations who work in the space to step up and in that context, we could determine how we might partner with those kinds of organizations, potentially to, you know, bolster our own program.", "12231 But I don\u2019t really think it's the -- it's in the DNA of the ISP to provide those sorts of digital literacy programs. And I might then throw it to Scott, because I think he can shed some light on the interplay between digital literacy and actual adoption. ", "12232 Scott?", "12233 DR. WALLSTEN: Yeah, unfortunately, this was also part of the -- one of the -- another surprising result from the pilot programs that the FCC did, which was that the digital literacy classes, even free or when you were given an additional discount on your broadband service if you take a digital literacy class, were not popular. People didn\u2019t want to do them. In one experiment that was designed explicitly to look at the effects of digital literacy, people were willing to pay an additional $10 a month to avoid digital literacy classes. I mean -- I say -- because their time is valuable to them too. ", "12234 And I mean, let me clarify that or make it a little bit more nuanced, because there were people who did self-select into digital literacy training and in those cases, the people who selected in seemed to subscribe a little bit longer than those who did not take digital literacy. I'm not sure that the differences were statistically significant and there was a lot of, you know, there was self-selection in there, but it does show that there might be -- you know, that there still could be a role for it. We haven't quite figured it out, or at least, in the pilots, they hadn't.", "12235 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm not sure if the vice-chair's desire to have a break is a want or a need, but it seems wise, in any event.

WATT: Sir, if you could give me the reference, this is the --- ", "12245 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It's to the PIAC et al. group. They've asked for (inaudible) 10 and 3.", "12246 MR. WATT: And the reference was 10 down and 3 up. Well, I think for many of the companies in Canada, that would incur significant cost. I do not have a cost estimate for that. For Rogers, we can't accommodate that speed. ", "12247 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Is it possible for you to give us an estimate of financial impact?", "12248 MR. WATT: You know, I really don\u2019t think we could. ", "12249 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "12250 MR. WATT: I don't know what it would cost the other providers to increase to that functionality. ", "12251 Ms. Blackwell, would you --- ", "12252 MS. BLACKWELL: I think it would be dependent on what assumptions about serving technology that you might be using. If we are to take on face some of the submissions of satellite-based providers, that perhaps a 10 and 1 service is something that is available at a commercial rates now, or in the next two years. Within the next five years, even OneWeb is suggesting 25 and 5, so it's not a question of -- it depends on what technology you're assuming. If you're assuming a wire line terrestrial technology, and can it be available today, obviously, that's a lot of -- I think it would be quite a bit of money. ", "12253 I know that when Bell Canada appeared earlier this week, one of their appendices had a fair amount of costing around what they thought, based on taking some proxies from Connecting Canadians and trying to do some estimates of, well, if that was what it cost to 5 and 1, and it might cost -- or if it was a magnitude more to do a 10 and 1 or to that area. ", "12254 So it involves a number of assumptions. Could this panel or group go away and develop their own assumptions? It's possible, but I'm not sure that it would be that much more -- shed that much more light on the issue. So I mean, we could assume right now, well, if we're relying on a satellite plans that are already been announced, then the cost, in terms of a subsidy might be zero. ", "12255 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. ", "12256 What is the best solution to connecting the north, in particular, satellite-dependent communities? ", "12257 MR. WATT: We think the best solution for connecting the north is of course, obviously satellite. By definition, satellite-dependent locations is satellite. We really think that there will always be locations in this country, in the far north, that will have to be served by satellite, that it will be uneconomic to ever bring a fibre backbone or transport facility to that location. ", "12258 For example, understanding is the Mackenzie River valley optic line 1,152 kilometres, it's $84 million. That's about $77,000 a kilometre for that fibre line, and that's just the installation and the line, so not the ongoing maintenance of it. And you know, there are places that are literally 1,000 kilometres away from any other place that may well only have 300 inhabitants and you just can't afford to put in an $84 million line to that location.", "12259 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right, and you think the transfer of the current subsidy from telephone to internet would be sufficient to subsidize 5 and 1 in the north via satellite at a --- ", "12260 MR. WATT: We do.", "12261 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- comparable price?", "12262 MR. WATT: We think the exhibit that Bell put before you on Tuesday, having looked at it, was a really good effort at sizing the cost problem. And so they had a range and admittedly, a wide range, 1.2 billion to 1.7 billion, roughly, to accommodate 5 down, one up. And that did include or rely upon satellite provision to many of the far north locations. ", "12263 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The question on the subsidy, if -- and in your indication, and obviously technologically, once you have internet of a certain standard you have VoIP service and you have voice service, but what about redundancy in those situations? A lot of those remote communities, they face pretty severe weather conditions and the power can go out. Wouldn't that be an issue that we would have to address?", "12264 MR. WATT: I think it is an issue, but it's an issue today. These locations still face power outages which will impair service. I think the satellite people are better to speak to this but I know that they spoke of they can have diverse transponders and ways to address this.", "12265 And I think you are -- again, we're talking about the true satellite dependent locations. They're actually -- an example I just gave, the Mackenzie River Valley, they actually are going to have a diverse fibre route because being at least planned to announce to build a $40 million pipeline from Dawson City over to Inuvik.", "12266 So you would have this loop but the other locations, I take your point that there are clearly a risk of outreach with satellite but just not sure there is any other feasible alternative.", "12267 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I understand your position.", "12268 Should quality of service standards be part of basic service?", "12269 MR. WATT: We think the competitive marketplace is setting the standard for quality of service in those locations where you have a subsidy, so the uneconomic places. Our assumption is that in the bidding process, people would bid with a certain price, a certain quality of standard that they would be held to so that you then could obviously compare competing economic bids and choose the least-cost solution.", "12270 So, in that way, we think quality of service could be maintained for the competitive marketplace. No, we think the competitive marketplace is providing an excellent quality of service.", "12271 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It would assured through the bidding process.", "12272 MR. WATT: Through the bidding process.", "12273 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And do you see it -- does 5 and 1 meet the needs of medium and small business?", "12274 MR. WATT: This is a very interesting area.", "12275 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Because we look at, you know, some of the -- I mean the situation for a lot of those areas, they talk about economic development issues and that sort of stuff, and it's kind of key in terms of setting those standards.", "12276 MR. WATT: I guess the question is the basic telecom service, are we talking about a residential service there or a business service? I ask that in a sense we have every Canadian right to a voice line currently. Now, for business, I'm not sure if that definition includes business or if it's speaking to residential service there.", "12277 But what I would say is that, to date, the Commission and in the regulated world previously, business rates were significantly higher than residential rates for individual line business service.", "12278 So now -- and I understand that it's more of a blurry line maybe than what's in the path, although you always -- my understanding in theory, if you're operating a business out of your home, you are to pay the business rate. Now, I know a number of people pay the residential rate but it seems to me that the problem becomes much more complex if we're trying to set a basic service definition to be set at a level that were to accommodate business enterprise.", "12279 I think the business enterprise needs to determine by its business plan whether it makes sense in that location with its costs and revenues and yet, it should stand on its ---", "12280 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: What I'm trying to get at a little bit is just if 5 and 1 is all that's available in a community, is that sufficient to sustain a small business operation?", "12281 If I live in Baker Lake and I decide I want to sell furs online, is that -- can I operate that business?", "12282 MR. WATT: Well, my understanding and I've to go and check my notes but I believe that there is a business service offered that is significantly more expensive than what is offered to the residential customers. I'd have to check the speed but the speed is faster and the byte cap is higher.", "12283 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "12284 MS. BLACKWELL: I don\u2019t know if this is that much more help. I consider myself a small business person and I have frequently found myself in a position of relying on 5 and 1 service as I travel my business around.", "12285 It really depends on the nature of what your business is and I think if it's an ecommerce, is it a -- I mean you get into speeds as a lot of it is time sensitivity of that exchange of the internet traffic.", "12286 So some businesses are going to have requirements that may be challenged under 5 and 1, but I think to Mr. Watt\u2019s point, then it's an issue of is this the best location for my business. Is it a viable spot?", "12287 So are we setting standards from a business and a residential perspective, and I know the Commission has turned its mind to issues around subsidies for business services in high cost areas in the context of telephone and it's -- the analysis comes down to is the cost of a higher greater service a business may require, is that a threat to the viability of that business? And the answer was no in this context.", "12288 As I say, I'm sure you could come up with a scenario of a small business that would have potentially higher needs, but a lot of the kinds of applications, as shown in CRTC Exhibit 1, are maybe applications that a small business could work with and those are all supported by 5 and 1 speeds.", "12289 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "12290 What is your response to the Cable Systems Alliance proposal that they\u2019d be able to discover where facilities exist and then be able to contact the owner of those facilities and gain access?", "12291 MR. WATT: Yes, I've heard this matter discussed. Frankly, I was surprised to hear that there was a problem. I think it is fairly well known who the providers of transport are. And I would think, you know, you could in any location pretty much phone the five or six people who you think who you would expect to have facilities in that area and ask what they offer.", "12292 It's another way and this could be maybe too general but I believe it's public information but twice a year, the carriers provide the interchange private line report and it\u2019s a route by route listing of where there is -- where parties have facilities. This is in order to gain forbearance in that location.", "12293 So I think they should be able to find out who has facilities and transport in their area.", "12294 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes. I mean their evidence was that that's a problem. Would there be anything -- would you object to their suggestion of having that information available to us so they could ---", "12295 MR. WATT: No, no, Rogers certainly would not object. For our transport facility, it would be no problem telling you where we have facilities.", "12296 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "12297 You indicated -- I just want to touch on accessibility item mobile. In here some place, paragraph 27 of your oral I guess in the presentation, data-only wireless flex plan for advocacy groups. I just wanted to touch on that as the availability of wireless plans and fixed plans in terms of data discounts or enhanced accessibility for groups like the people who would be using VRS and that sort of stuff.", "12298 Can you summarize for me where you are at with that and your presentation indicates that you feel you are making progress to meeting their needs?", "12299 MR. WATT: Certainly. I\u2019ll ask Deborah Evans who\u2019s our expert in this area to address these matters. ", "12300 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "12301 MS. EVANS: Thank you.", "12302 So we introduced last year about mid-March a data-only flex plan. So it starts at 150 megabytes of data. It\u2019s data and unlimited text messaging. It\u2019s $35 a month and then it flexes up to a 4 gigabyte tier.", "12303 We had originally, when we first introduced the plan, we had started at a regular voice data and text plan with a discount to account for disability groups not using voice. But we were hearing from the advocacy groups and our customers that that wasn\u2019t sufficient to meet their needs. ", "12304 They really just wanted us to introduce a plan that took voice out so that\u2019s what we did. We introduced it. We\u2019ve promoted it on our website. We\u2019ve spoken to some advocacy groups. We\u2019ve made them aware of its existence. And we are slowly seeing some customers taking this up.", "12305 We will be working with the groups to make sure it\u2019s more broadly known to them but this is how we\u2019re addressing it.", "12306 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So that would be news to many of them that there is a plan available to them that excludes voice. Well, they indicated -- let me put it this way. They indicated when they were here that such plans were not available.", "12307 MS. EVANS: I\u2019m surprised to hear that some of them would have said that because I personally have met with a couple of the parties who were there and I did tell them about it. It was news to them when I met with them and told them, so we do recognize that there\u2019s more that we can be doing in this space. And we\u2019re having regular dialogues and I\u2019ve undertaken to continue that discussion with them, and make sure that we partner we them so that their constituency group is made more aware of it.", "12308 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. And unless I\u2019m erred in putting words into their mouth, my expectation was they were asking us to mandate that and might not have said that it\u2019s not available. So anyway, thank you for clarifying on that.", "12309 Just want to touch on references to the Universal Service Fund in the U.S., $130 billion. Can you -- for me I believe the last number I saw was that that disperses about 7.4 billion U.S. a year, something like that, to about $10 billion Canadian.", "12310 DR. WALLSTEN: Yeah, it\u2019s actually it may go above 10 billion U.S. this year but it\u2019s been up above 8 and to $9 billion. And that $130 billion is in real dollars. So it started in 1995 so that\u2019s in 2015 dollars that total.", "12311 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And you have argued that that is an inefficient use of funds?", "12312 DR. WALLSTEN: That\u2019s correct. ", "12313 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: What level of inefficiency do you think it functions at?", "12314 DR. WALLSTEN: Well, I think it\u2019s inefficient on a number of levels. Broadly speaking, it gives out money inefficiently and it takes in money inefficiently. ", "12315 On the how it raises money, it raises money by taxing telecom services. And every quarter a group at the FCC sets the tax rate that they need to have in order to raise enough money. The most recent rate I think is about 18.2 percent, and that\u2019s on what they call long-distance services. And of course long-distance as a service itself doesn\u2019t really exist so it\u2019s spread across mobile and international (inaudible) calls. ", "12316 So because it\u2019s -- so it\u2019s going to affect people who are on the margin of whether or not they will connect because it increases the price. It\u2019s inequitable in that sense because the burden falls especially heavily on low-income people and immigrants who call abroad often with calling cards. And low-income families are more likely to be wireless only households and the tax is more heavily on wireless. So that\u2019s on the how you get the money side.", "12317 On the how you give out the money side, there are several different programs. There\u2019s the High Cost Fund, which we now call the Connect American Fund. The Lifeline Fund, which is the Affordability Fund, which has just been changed although they haven\u2019t released the text of the order yet. And we have schools and libraries; that\u2019s the bulk of it.", "12318 On high cost, it\u2019s mostly been a cost-based program. And so these rural telephone companies, there are thousands of them, get sort of pretty much however much money they ask for. There are companies in Alaska that get $5,000 per year per line in subsidies. The FCC set, as part of its most recent reforms, a cap of $2,500 per month per line, which as itself sounds outrageous. But they couldn\u2019t even stick to that cap because some of these companies immediately appealed and were given, you know, their higher and higher amounts.", "12319 So there\u2019s no effort at all to distribute the money in any sort of cost effective way by, you know, say rank ordering, getting the biggest bang for the buck. It\u2019s just whoever, you know, sort of is eligible gets it.", "12320 And then on the availability side, most of the research unfortunately has shown that it\u2019s had a largely (inaudible) marginal effects. It hasn\u2019t increased telephone adoption among low-income people. It only just recently -- that side only just recently turned to broadband so we don\u2019t, you know, we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to change. Although pretty much all they\u2019ve done is change the subsidy from voice to allow it to be also broadband.", "12321 The General Accounting Office and the Office of Management and Budget private independent analyses pretty much all show the same thing, and especially GAO has, in almost every report it does on these programs, it tells the FCC that it has to -- it should set some sort of measurable objectives, which it never does. And they say, you know, we can\u2019t even evaluate whether this is doing anything, you know, whether it\u2019s meeting the goals if you don\u2019t set any goals. And they\u2019re sort of just not taken seriously.", "12322 So I probably went on for a lot longer than you had wanted, but it is unfortunately an inefficient and inequitable program.", "12323 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. You don\u2019t have to excuse yourself for being passionate on a topic.", "12324 Those are all my questions. I expect my colleagues may or may not have more so I will turn them over to you. Thank you very much. ", "12325 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "12326 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thanks. I just have one question.", "12327 I don\u2019t think I heard you speak much about mobility products or broadband. There was a lot of discussion leading into this about setting a basic service and what is basic service in the future. And I\u2019m sure you know well, having read the record, that a lot of people were talking about mobility products. I\u2019ve seen no response to any of that in your comments here today. ", "12328 What are your thoughts on expanding basic telephone service definitions to include access to mobility services?", "12329 MR. WATT: You\u2019re correct. We have obviously focused on the wireline situation with respect to basic telephone service. I\u2019m going to ask Suzanne to just speak to it a bit more. ", "12330 In terms of wireless, we\u2019re thinking of situations where people are working out in fields and so on and so forth. Again, we have extended coverage to almost all of the population but there is a couple of percent that can\u2019t get it. The problem is in Canada we\u2019ve -- well, Rogers -- we\u2019ve spent about $20 billion and we covered 10 percent of the geographic map of Canada. It\u2019s the problem.", "12331 So in terms of suggesting or saying that you could have -- you have right to a wireless service in Canada, I think even if we were to go down that path you\u2019d really have to narrowly circumscribe or define what the geographic footprint would be to make, otherwise the cost would be absolutely astronomical.", "12332 I\u2019m not sure if that is addressing the concern that you were raising.", "12333 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, it was a concern raised in this proceeding by many Canadians in that, as you know, they believe that it\u2019s an important service. It\u2019s a service for emergencies, and security, and economically for some folks.", "12334 Yeah. So would it make any sense to look at extending broadband in a way that could meet the needs of kind of both of these for mobility and for basic broadband? Essentially I\u2019m saying would it make any sense to say something like LTE should be the preferred means of extending wherever possible, extending broadband so it can meet the needs of sort of the broader constituents?", "12335 MR. WATT: Well, I think what we have in mind is for the programs where you would apply for the very -- otherwise uneconomic areas I think we had in mind a technologically neutral approach so that if LTE was the lowest cost technology that it could be deployed. I heard Xplornet saying they\u2019re deploying LTE on fixed wireless, which may hold some promise.", "12336 LTE on mobile wireless, the issue is the -- it\u2019s not so much the speed, it\u2019s the absolute capacity that is available. So the issue on wireless would be definitely bit caps.", "12337 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah. Could you help me understand that? Why is there that capacity constraint on the mobile?", "12338 MR. WATT: I ask the same --", "12339 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I mean, if --", "12340 MR. WATT: -- thing of my engineers and they --", "12341 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- they\u2019re talking about sort of ---", "12342 MR. WATT: -- tell me it is physics.", "12343 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: It\u2019s physics?", "12344 MR. WATT: The laws of physics.", "12345 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Even where there\u2019s not a lot of customers? There would not be potentially --", "12346 MR. WATT: Well ---", "12347 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- the same amount of traffic and congestion --", "12348 MR. WATT: Different --", "12349 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- within these areas.", "12350 MR. WATT: -- different issue there. See, the laws of economics that it would be incredibly expensive. Cell site for us is roughly $800,000. So if it were serving, you know, 100 people, it would be an uneconomic cell site.", "12351 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "12352 MR. WATT: That radius is about -- the diameter of that circle is I believe about 25 kilometres for the $800,000.", "12353 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You just mentioned Xplornet and the fact that they\u2019re using LTE to deliver fixed wireless. And they suggested one of the things we could do would be to provide a recommendation to Innovation Canada, I\u2019ll just shorten it, as it regards Spectrum allocations. Because I\u2019m sure you heard them, you know, in areas particularly the areas on the fringe of major urban, it\u2019s pretty hard for them to get access to Spectrum and there is people out there that are unserved. Do you have any comments on whether or not we should be looking at that? Again, as to making a recommendation.", "12354 MR. WATT: M\u2019hm.", "12355 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Obviously, we don\u2019t manage Spectrum.", "12356 MR. WATT: Right. I think I\u2019ll ask Howard Slawner to speak to the wireless licensing issues. He\u2019s very familiar with those and is our expert on this panel for that.", "12357 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And we are not, as you know so well.", "12358 MR. SLAWNER: So Innovation Canada sets the licence areas for all the Spectrum licences. And they have four tiers basically. Tier one is the national licence area. Tier two is basically provincial, although Ontario and Quebec are split into three. Tier three is -- they\u2019re about 59 areas across Canada and tier four is the smallest, about 172.", "12359 A lot of the fixed wireless Spectrum actually got auctioned at tier four, which is the smallest. The issue that Xplornet has is even though it\u2019s the smallest, areas like Toronto or Calgary still include a lot of the area surrounding it.", "12360 The problem that Innovation Canada has is they had to pick borders that kind of conform to the population centres, the geography of the land, and then any kind of interference issues by the adjoining licence holders. So the big areas like Toronto and Calgary still have to be kind of big.", "12361 That being said, when we buy or get the licence for the Spectrum, we\u2019re still very willing to -- if we\u2019re not using in a certain area, we\u2019re willing to subordinate it, which is kind of issue a sub-licence to other partners out there, which we\u2019ve done with a lot of carriers. So there are mechanisms already in existence that carriers who want to use Spectrum that another carrier isn\u2019t already using that they can get that Spectrum.", "12362 So we\u2019ve entered into agreements with several people who have already appeared before the Commission this past week and we\u2019ll keep doing this. If we\u2019re not going to launch a service in this area ourself, we\u2019re very open to listening to anybody who wants to actually use that Spectrum themselves.", "12363 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, thank you. As I said, I mean, we\u2019re not the experts on this, but it didn\u2019t seem appropriate that you would come before us and not speak of any wireless issues at all in this. So thank you.", "12364 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner MacDonald?", "12365 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Good afternoon. I just have one question with respect to your Connected for Success program. And congratulations on that initiative.", "12366 I understand why you would roll it out to individuals living in government-supported housing because someone else has already done the means testing for that. Is there a way to work with government to expand that program to low income Canadians that do not live in supported housing?", "12367 MS. DINSMORE: We have talked with the Province in Ontario. It\u2019s Ontario Works who handles this kind of thing. It becomes a lot more complicated to figure out how to do that. And one of the things I think would be helpful if you understood is that we never know who these Canadians are. So -- and there\u2019s a lot of concern on the part of the housing operations that we deal with to ensure that we don\u2019t. ", "12368 So how it works is that we partner with the housing operation -- Not for Profit Community Housing Organization. And through that partnership they will agree that they will provide us with a unit number to which we will direct market the unit number, the offer, and then that person in that unit will call Rogers, the special line, special number for this particular offer, not our regular call centre. And that\u2019s how the thing works.", "12369 So even in that context it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot of caretaking. And actually, we have some new signatories for whom we actually have to add an extra step because even they find that to be potentially problematic from a privacy perspective.", "12370 So we\u2019re just getting over these sorts of things in terms of this role that we\u2019re optimistic. We think it\u2019s all going to work just fine.", "12371 We heard, you know, the folks, the AAC when they came up and they said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s double penalizing those who can\u2019t get into community housing. There\u2019s a wait list. Not only can they not get in, now they can\u2019t get the Rogers offer. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d And we agree that\u2019s too bad. We would like to be able to serve those people as well.", "12372 But at this stage, we\u2019re really just -- I mean, we\u2019re just rolling out phase -- this second phase where we\u2019re going to blanket, you know, Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. Possibly through that process we will find that there is some other way. But for now, I think it\u2019s enough for us just to get the service out to the people that need to get it within the Community Housing Operations.", "12373 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay. So I\u2019m hearing you\u2019re not opposed to rolling it out on a larger scale. There will just be some challenges that would need to be addressed and considered before that happens.", "12374 MS. DINSMORE: There would be some challenges, yeah. There would be some challenges.", "12375 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay. Thank you.", "12376 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just a few questions. ", "12377 Paragraph 29 of your oral presentation you refer to several studies that concluded in your view that the programs are costly, inefficient and inequitable.", "12378 Is there a list somewhere you can point to of the studies you were referring to?", "12379 DR. WALLSTEN: Sure. Actually, I have compiled those. I could -- I\u2019d be happy to provide it.", "12380 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So you could provide that --", "12381 DR. WALLSTEN: Yeah.", "12382 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- as an undertaking --", "12383 DR. WALLSTEN: M\u2019hm.", "12384 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- so we know exactly what you\u2019re referring to.", "12385 ", "UNDERTAKING", "12386 THE CHAIRPERSON: You constructively and helpfully provided some principles in Appendix 1 today, and I won\u2019t go over the territory the Vice-Chair covered earlier. But you probably followed the discussion I had earlier with I think Bell where I referred to David Johnston\u2019s report entitled \u201cThe New National Dream Networking the Nation for Broadband Access.\u201d And I asked them if they agreed or not with the nine principles that were identified in that report.", "12387 And should I take it that you -- by providing your own principles you disagree with the previous principles?", "12388 MR. WATT: That is correct. We looked at these principles in developing the five that we placed here.", "12389 THE CHAIRPERSON: And could you address why you think the principles as articulated back then don\u2019t make sense or are not the ones you support?", "12390 MR. WATT: We didn\u2019t think that any of them didn\u2019t make sense. We just synthesized them down to the five that we presented.", "12391 THE CHAIRPERSON: What did you leave out, in your view?", "12392 MR. WATT: We actually didn\u2019t leave any out. We just -- we combined --", "12393 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "12394 MR. WATT: -- a number of these.", "12395 THE CHAIRPERSON: So you think they dovetailed. There\u2019s no contradiction.", "12396 MR. WATT: Yes. There ---", "12397 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "12398 MR. WATT: No, there\u2019s nothing -- sorry, not clear. There was nothing that we didn\u2019t agree with in the nine. So we didn\u2019t leave any out. We ---", "12399 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. That was the nature of my question. By providing something you call different principles and there\u2019s a lesser number one could conclude that you disagree with the original -- the nine I was asking questions about earlier, but that is not the case.", "12400 MR. WATT: No, no problem with the nine. THE CHAIRPERSON: You\u2019ve just rearticulated them in a different bundle. Fair enough.", "12401 You made reference to a multi-stakeholder advisory council. Have you given some thoughts to potential terms of reference?", "12402 MR. WATT: We have not come up with anything new. We reviewed the Telecom Policy Panel Review Report and they, I believe, talk about terms of reference there, and we would use those as a starting point for this particular body.", "12403 And we -- I dislike giving undertakings, but we\u2019ve only -- we\u2019ve had a couple of days, we\u2019ve talked about this fairly extensively, but this could be something -- we wish we could come back with something in our final written remarks.", "12404 THE CHAIRPERSON: When I used to practice law in the private sector I was always willing to volunteer to hold the pen because you have some influence that others may not have. So will you undertake to do that?", "12405 MR. WATT: We will.", "12406 ", "UNDERTAKING", "12407 THE CHAIRPERSON: We won\u2019t necessarily agree with everything but you might have the opportunity to frame those terms of reference.", "12408 What do you see in terms of the outcomes or the remit of such a multi-stakeholder advisory council?", "12409 MR. WATT: Sorry, I was being asked whether -- so this is an undertaking for the May 5th date as opposed to ---", "12410 THE CHAIRPERSON: Unless you have -- yes, it was for the May 5th, yes.", "12411 MR. WATT: Sorry, about that. I got distracted. Could you repeat your question please?", "12412 THE CHAIRPERSON: My follow-up question was what would be the outcome or remit for this advisory council?", "12413 MR. WATT: The outcome. I think you\u2019re asking what their objective is?", "12414 THE CHAIRPERSON: What would they do? What\u2019s the work? Maybe that\u2019s -- does it overlap with the terms of reference?", "12415 I mean, perhaps it\u2019s the -- maybe -- you used an Appendix 1 principles. Strangely enough I thought those were outcomes, but anyhow.", "12416 MR. WATT: Well, really what we thought this group would do, based on these principles they would address the gaps that you\u2019ve identified, and they would -- well, first, really building off this decision, I think you will establish a basic definition and it will have at least a speed target.", "12417 And with that as the objective, there then would be the gap analysis as to where we are now because we know we\u2019re not there now. Then I think this group would help coordinate all the information that\u2019s necessary. What you\u2019re really trying to do is determine the best most economical and fastest way to get that service to -- in the geographic gap situation to the people who don\u2019t have it today. ", "12418 And then you\u2019re going to have basically -- in our view, there\u2019s no reason why you wouldn\u2019t use the same application process for -- potentially for the federal government money and in our position the redirected contribution money. So it would be the same type of application program. ", "12419 And then you would -- they would set up the body that would handle basically what is the RFP process and the bidding process and then they would be responsible -- and again, this is setting the framework. The very senior people obviously wouldn\u2019t be doing the work. But then you would have the action plan that you\u2019re trying to do and then they would monitor it and keep people on track and make sure that it was put in place. ", "12420 THE CHAIRPERSON: Now, you\u2019ve mentioned action plan with respect to rolling out greater connectivity.", "12421 MR. WATT: M\u2019hm.", "12422 THE CHAIRPERSON: But would they also keep track on issues that you\u2019ve also mentioned as principles in Appendix 1 dealing with -- well, availability, that would be covered, but affordability and adoption as well?", "12423 MR. WATT: Yes.", "12424 THE CHAIRPERSON: So all the areas here?", "12425 MR. WATT: All of the gaps.", "12426 THE CHAIRPERSON: How long do you see this multi-stakeholder advisory council being required in terms of timeframe?", "12427 And I\u2019ll ask the question in a -- well, first of all, I\u2019ve been involved in another life with committees that start off at the deputy minister level and they last very long and so deputies don\u2019t show up anymore and assistant deputy ministers show up, and then it\u2019s lasted even longer and so even assistant deputy minister\u2019s don\u2019t show up and so it\u2019s director generals, and then 10 years later it\u2019s a bunch of very hardworking but more junior analysts that are involved.", "12428 So how do you see it? Where -- because there is a risk that we lose steam.", "12429 And, you know, I might quote to you what -- well, David Johnston, he wasn\u2019t His Excellency at the time but still a good man, but when he wrote the covering message from the chair of the committee he said, \u201cFinally we thank\u201d -- he thanked the ministers at the time, which was Mr. Tobin and Mr. Manley: ", "12430 \u201c...for reaching out to citizens across the land through us for advice. Our message through them to their colleagues and our fellow citizens is carpe diem and keep the completion focus of 2004.\u201d", "12431 So, in light of all that, what\u2019s the timeframe for this advisory council?", "12432 MR. WATT: Having not discussed this with anybody on my panel, in my opinion, I think you would have the advisory council very active for a year and a half, two years. ", "12433 You then -- you\u2019re going to have to -- and it quite possibly could devolve back to the federal department and the CRTC, because at that point, in our opinion, you would be into -- we believe you could be at the stage where you would have had your application, your bidding process completed, and then you\u2019re into a monitoring process, which would not require the -- really the very senior people. ", "12434 So the deputy minister, an example, would not have to be involved, but we think there would be, you know, an ongoing role for a level of this collective activity to exist throughout the entire five-year period because we\u2019re assuming there will be a five-year review of basic telecom and that -- you know, that they don\u2019t really see any other way around it.", "12435 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Well, I appreciate you didn\u2019t have a chance to consult more broadly. So I guess if we never see you again at a CRTC hearing that was the wrong answer.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "12436 THE CHAIRPERSON: But I ---", "12437 MR. WATT: We\u2019ll find out.", "12438 THE CHAIRPERSON: I trust your level of expertise and knowledge about such things.", "12439 Sorry, you look like you wanted to add something.", "12440 MR. WATT: I think it might be wiser if I didn\u2019t.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "12441 THE CHAIRPERSON: I understand.", "12442 Those I believe are our questions as well. So thank you.", "12443 MR. WATT: Thank you.", "12444 THE CHAIRPERSON: Your mic\u2019s on. I don\u2019t know why that might be -- okay -- because I think you didn\u2019t want to add anything.", "12445 Okay. That\u2019s good. Thank you very much for your participation and your constructive approach to the issues before us. Thank you.", "12446 It\u2019s not that we agree with everything but it was constructive.", "12447 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "12448 THE SECRETARY: I would now ask the Canadian Taxpayers Federation to come to the presentation table.", "12449 Please introduce yourself and you have 10 minutes.", "12450 THE CHAIRPERSON: Press the button so the light -- yes. That way we can hear you well ---", "12451 MR. WUDRICK: Thank you.", "12452 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- and people who are listening online can follow it as well.", "PRESENTATION", "12453 MR. WUDRICK: It certainly helps.", "12454 My name is Aaron Wudrick. I\u2019m the Federal Director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.", "12455 I\u2019d like to thank the Commission very much for the opportunity to appear today.", "12456 The CTF, for those who do not know, we are a non-profit citizen\u2019s advocacy group. We are dedicated to three principles, lower taxes, less waste, and accountable government. We\u2019ve been existence about a quarter of a century and we now count almost 90,000 supporters across Canada. ", "12457 I suspect my remarks today will differ somewhat from most of the other presentations which the Commission has heard in these proceedings. ", "12458 First of all we are not an obvious stakeholder in the telecommunication industry and the focus of our advocacy is not normally on telecommunications policy or issues.", "12459 But we requested to appear nonetheless because we believe we can contribute an alternative perspective which would be useful as part of this conversation and frankly the very nature of these proceedings probably an unavoidable pitfall of them as they tend to have an interest bias. ", "12460 People with strong opinions about telecoms policy are likely to appear. There are however millions of Canadians who are frankly unaware of the CRTC, what you do and there\u2019s really no way to get those people to come here. ", "12461 We certainly don\u2019t suggest we speak on behalf of all of them, but I would suggest that some of the comments that I have are things that would be on the minds of some of these people.", "12462 As you might expect from an organisation which is focused on the tax burden that Canadians face, the primary concern from the CTF\u2019s perspective is less in the details of any broadband strategy that the CRTC lands upon, but rather in the simple question will it result in Canadians having to pay effectively a new tax in order to pay for this strategy.", "12463 It will also be no surprise that the CTF oppose any such new tax, or levy, or access fee, or any other creative moniker which is applied to a mandated cost which will ultimately borne -- be borne by consumers, for the express purpose of subsidizing other consumers.", "12464 I suggest that the core of these proceedings is a philosophical question. When is it appropriate for some people to subsidize the services consumed by other people? ", "12465 More specifically, should the CRTC force some Canadians to subsidize the cost of broadband for other Canadians? ", "12466 And is access to broadband at, for example, a particular price, a right which should be enjoyed by all Canadians, regardless of where they live? ", "12467 Since I believe there will be no shortage of witnesses arguing for an answer in the affirmative on that, let me simply present a brief counterargument.", "12468 For those Canadians who choose where they want to live within our country, there\u2019s a range of trade-offs that must always be considered. ", "12469 There are advantages and disadvantages to living, for example, in a large city, compared to a rural area. ", "12470 Costs are a large part of this equation, as are the range of amenities and services that will be available to you where you live. ", "12471 If peace and quiet and wide open spaces are important to you, the downtown area of a large city might not be your cup of tea", "12472 And similarly, if you value having a wide selection of say restaurants or shopping opportunities within walking distance, that small town with the one stoplight might not be your best bet. ", "12473 So if we view the availability, speed and price of broadband as simply another one of these types of considerations, it therefore becomes questionable as to whether or not it\u2019s the duty of some Canadians to subsidize the choices of other Canadians.", "12474 But leaving that aside, should this commission decide that it is indeed a right that all Canadians have broadband access at an affordable price, we would urge the Commission to try and find a way to do it without imposing a new cost on consumers. ", "12475 The reason these consultations were launched is because of the recognition that the definition of \u201cbasic services\u201d requires updating. ", "12476 This does not mean the definition needs to expand indefinitely without also assessing what could be removed from the definition. ", "12477 It seems logical that, for example, obsolete or declining technologies be considered to be dropped and replaced with new and emerging ones, with the result being that consumers do not face the prospect of ever-increasing taxes and fees.", "12478 As I\u2019ve noted, it had already been mentioned in these proceedings the National Contribution Fund, which already exists, provides for the subsidy of residential landline telephone service. ", "12479 However the trend line, with respect to landline service is quite clear, use is in decline. ", "12480 So we would suggest that it would make little sense for the CRTC to continue funding a declining technology and instead to think about reallocating those -- that existing funding toward more relevant, up-to-date technologies including broadband services.", "12481 In closing, we recognize that some advocates for a new fee to subsidize broadband insist that the amount is small and it\u2019s true that in many cases it would be the issues of a couple dollars on a consumers\u2019 monthly bill. ", "12482 But we would counter that this has to be considered in a wider context. Canadians face increased taxes, fees and prices on a wide range of goods and services, none of which in and of themselves is very large, but in the aggregate can start to add up very quickly and become very significant. ", "12483 There are many other worthwhile causes aside from broadband with advocates making similar cases, but this of course becomes problematic when there are proponents of dozens or hundreds of different causes the costs start to add up very quickly for Canadians.", "12484 So we simply ask that the Commission bear that in mind when considering the impact of what might otherwise be a very small cost. Thank you very much.", "12485 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well thank you. And rather than have a long debate as to what a tax is and isn\u2019t, why don\u2019t we just agree to put that within quotes --", "12486 MR. WUDRICK: Fair enough.", "12487 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- in our context and move on to a more substantial discussion. ", "12488 So I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner Vennard.", "12489 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good afternoon. Thanks for coming to talk to us today. ", "12490 You present a really interesting perspective here and I would just like to unpack some of your thinking, because it is quite different than what we\u2019ve been presented with.", "12491 First of all, I want to just focus in for a few moments on the idea of the choice and you suggest that if people choose to live in certain areas they\u2019re going to get -- there\u2019s a trade-off. There\u2019s a payoff and there\u2019s a trade-off. ", "12492 I would like to get your comments on those people who do not choose to have -- would not choose to have broadband because of affordability issues.", "12493 MR. WUDRICK: M\u2019hm.", "12494 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: If you\u2019re making a choice it\u2019s a free country, you can make your choices, but sometimes choices are made for us.", "12495 MR. WUDRICK: Yes, I think, you know, this discussion turns on whether you characterize it as a choice or frankly as a service which is imperative or amenity that\u2019s optional. ", "12496 I mean, we look at things like education and health care, for example, these are things that are deemed as rights, that Canadians can expect to have regardless of where they live and in those instances, you know, the costs become something that other Canadians are expected to bear. ", "12497 So I think the discussion here turns on whether or not -- do we view broadband -- is it categorized as something vital and imperative to an individual being able to succeed in life or is it something that\u2019s nice to have, but that not all people, you know, if they can\u2019t afford it or if they live in a place where it becomes uneconomic for it to exist is that just a sacrifice that they have to live with.", "12498 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes and there\u2019s where, you know, I think a major part of this kind of hinges is, you know, looking at that, because it\u2019s beyond our mandate and scope here at the Commission ---", "12499 MR. WUDRICK: M\u2019hm.", "12500 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- to start looking at things like rights. We\u2019re looking at the objectives, the basic -- what should we be thinking about as basic services. ", "12501 MR. WUDRICK: M\u2019hm.", "12502 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So if we look at the basic services being things -- access to such things as you mentioned, health care, 911, that sort of thing, then how do you see that?", "12503 Do you see that as being a basic service that most people would like given the opportunity to make a choice to have it or how does that fit into your argument?", "12504 MR. WUDRICK: Yes, it\u2019s interesting. I mean I had not considered it from this view because, you know, when we had looked at what we thought the intent of a national broadband strategy was -- it was that it was an issue of geography. ", "12505 It was less an issue of -- because there are obviously people of lesser means in urban areas.", "12506 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "12507 MR. WUDRICK: That have accessibility of these things, but for the cost.", "12508 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "12509 MR. WUDRICK: And our view is more a question of there are many parts of this country which there\u2019s not a lot of people and there\u2019s a lot of distance. We\u2019ve heard from, you know, for example Rogers and TELUS that it\u2019s just not economic to do business in those places.", "12510 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "12511 MR. WUDRICK: Those were the people I think we were envisioning in terms of making a choice. Obviously if we\u2019re talking about individual with low income that would apply to Canadians wherever they live in the country and that is obviously a much broader class of people.", "12512 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes. ", "12513 And our country is moving in the way of digitization, I mean that\u2019s clear in almost everything we\u2019re doing, and some segment of society is going to be left behind if they do not have the option, or the choice, or the ability, or the means, to participate. ", "12514 What kind of comments would you make on that? How do you see that? ", "12515 MR. WUDRICK: They\u2019re -- I think -- that\u2019s a fair comment. I think there are also many other areas as well. I mean we look at education, for example, education is a lynch pin to success today. ", "12516 And there\u2019s a lot of discussion around access to that. Does that mean that we provide education for free? Some people argue that, you know, or do we subsidize it to a certain extent.", "12517 So I take your point and I, you know, recognize our viewpoint is on the further end of the spectrum in terms of taking (inaudible).", "12518 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes and that\u2019s the basic thing that we\u2019re trying to determine here is, like, education for example. ", "12519 You know we -- there\u2019s -- we provide a basic level of education. If you want more then you can pay for it, but it\u2019s there for people. ", "12520 MR. WUDRICK: Right. And so that is what we are trying to determine is what should be there for people. ", "12521 So from that point of view, what would you say should be there for people?", "12522 MR. WUDRICK: If you\u2019re asking if we believe that it is -- it is the duty of the government through the CRTC to provide Canadian citizens with access to the internet at a particular price. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a position we would take.", "12523 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So do you see anything as being a basic service?", "12524 MR. WUDRICK: Maybe health and education, for example. But I mean if you\u2019re asking us the direct question do we think the internet is something that, you know, the government needs to be in the business of we would probably say no.", "12525 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. I\u2019m asking you if you -- do you see anything to do with the internet being connected to the idea of a basic service of some kind, emergency, for example? Or do you think the landline will be just fine?", "12526 MR. WUDRICK: Well, I mean, if there\u2019s an area -- if there is a part of the country which does not have communication with the outside world I would view that as a problem. Does it have to be internet? I don\u2019t know that it has to be in the internet. Could it not be a landline or, you know, any other form of communication?", "12527 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So what would you see as a -- I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at here is what your perspective is on the function of the internet itself. And, you know, your perspective is your perspective. You\u2019re entitled to have whatever perspective you like. I\u2019m just trying to sort of drill down and see that.", "12528 MR. WUDRICK: Yeah. ", "12529 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Because more and more our lives are connected in one way or another to the internet. Our government is connected to the internet, our institutions are, healthcare. We have all sorts of different things that are provided through the internet.", "12530 MR. WUDRICK: Yeah. ", "12531 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So of all the different things -- and I\u2019m not necessarily talking here about something like, you know, Netflix or gaming or whatever, although to some people that\u2019s something that\u2019s very, very important and very, very basic. How does your organization view the internet, or do you just view it as just another expense and nobody really needs it?", "12532 MR. WUDRICK: No. I guess I\u2019d use this analogy. I guess there\u2019s two ways to look at the internet. Is it a public good like a road? Something that should be, you know, a consideration? That obviously people need roads to get to and from places.", "12533 Another important thing we all need is food. Food is largely in the hands of private enterprise and the government has less involvement in it.", "12534 So, you know, the internet is important. It\u2019s an important part of our lives. We all use it every day. I don\u2019t know that it falls, that it automatically falls in the category of road and not in the category of food. ", "12535 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So in your written submission you say that you agree that the definition of basic services can and should change over time, and where possible it should include the swapping out of obsolete or declining technologies in favour of new and emerging ones. ", "12536 What do you see as being -- how do you see that working? Can you unpack that for me and explain that to me?", "12537 MR. WUDRICK: Well, you know, we looked at some of the statistics because -- I think we\u2019re conceding the point here. We\u2019re now at the point where we\u2019re going to concede to you, okay, assuming we\u2019re going to agree that there have to be basic services does that mean that the definition -- we always add things to that definition. ", "12538 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "12539 MR. WUDRICK: Or are there things that over time become obsolete? And the argument that we are advancing is that landline telephones seem to be on the way out. They\u2019re in declining use. I personally haven\u2019t had a landline in I think seven years. ", "12540 And so it would make sense for us if we\u2019re going to decide to have basic services and things that consumers are expected to contribute to, we can agree to add new technologies or add new things to that definition. But simply look for ways where you can use the same amount of money but put towards the purposes that are more relevant and that are emerging.", "12541 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. You go on to say in the paragraph that follows in your written submission a reallocation of existing funding, and here I\u2019m presuming that you\u2019re referring to the National Contribution Fund.", "12542 MR. WUDRICK: Yeah. ", "12543 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: How do you see something like that working? You don\u2019t give us any information there and I\u2019d just like you to expand on that further.", "12544 MR. WUDRICK: Certainly. And I confess, I am certainly not an expert telecoms policy. But my understanding is the purpose of that fund is directed towards areas that require a subsidy for landline telephone use. So rather than directed towards landline use it could be redirected towards supporting the expansion of broadband into those same communities. So it would be a swap out in terms of rather than supporting landline it would be to support broadband.", "12545 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I just have one final thought for you to comment on, and that\u2019s basically is it okay to leave some Canadians behind?", "12546 MR. WUDRICK: I take your point. But as I think I made in my remarks, there are many worthy causes. There are many other things that Canadians will argue for. ", "12547 And as I put in my remarks, I didn\u2019t mention them orally, but if we took a dollar from every Canadian every year that would be $35 million for a cause. There are literally dozens of good causes that that money could be put towards. But there are hundreds of people making a case about their cause so, you know, this Commission is seized with broadband alone. ", "12548 There are other bodies, both government and non-government, that are seized with their own issues. If they all succeed in getting their issue forward, the aggregate cost of that does become significant. So and again, this comes back to the sort of diffuse nature. These proceedings will attract people who are interested in these issues particularly. Other issues will attract people interested in those issues. We are here to simply point that fact out.", "12549 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "12550 MR. WUDRICK: Thank you.", "12551 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I have no further questions. ", "12552 THE CHAIRPERSON: Vice-chair Menzies?", "12553 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thanks for coming. It\u2019s actually good to see you here in terms of the fact that all arguments are illustrated more fully in contrast.", "12554 Really just one question, and that goes so far as the North. You may not be aware of it, but I referred earlier to a report done a couple of years back by a group of stakeholders in the North. And it was headed up by the Department of National Defence and Border Services were there. ", "12555 And it concluded that connectivity, you know, of a communication system in the North was sub-standard and needed to be upgraded because it was a matter of survival, and based on three principles, the maintenance of sovereignty, security, and public safety. And that was for to be able to track vessels, exactly who was in our country ---", "12556 MR. WUDRICK: Yeah. ", "12557 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- in remote areas and vessels going through the Northwest Passage and other areas and that sort of stuff.", "12558 So would you concede -- no, I\u2019m not asking you to concede. Would you agree that sovereignty, security, and public safety are areas that Canadians would not have difficulty understanding that it should be subsidized in the North?", "12559 MR. WUDRICK: Yes, absolutely. I think that the closer you get to defining the services you\u2019re talking about along those lines I would agree. ", "12560 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, great. Thanks very much. And that was my question.", "12561 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. I don\u2019t have any questions. But I just want to make the point that although not everybody shows up at our hearing everybody has the opportunity to.", "12562 MR. WUDRICK: I understand, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.", "12563 THE CHAIRPERSON: And the barrier entry into a CRTC proceeding is the cost of a stamp, or not even that much. We allow people even to fill in questionnaires through phone calls, which we will pay the long-distance charges to. I know of no other federal minister of tribunal with lower barriers to entry. ", "12564 For some reason, for instance, our colleagues at the Energy Board are prohibited from hearing from certain interest groups. That\u2019s not our case. In fact, we go out of our way to make it available. And we\u2019re very thankful for you and your association for having participated in this. Okay? Thank you.", "12565 MR. WUDRICK: Thank you very much.", "12566 THE CHAIRPERSON: Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "12567 THE SECRETARY: I would now ask Michael McNally to come to presentation table.", "PRESENTATION", "12568 MR. McNALLY: Hello. My name is Michael McNally and I\u2019m an assistant professor at the School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Alberta. I want to begin by thanking the Commission for undertaking this review of basic telecommunication services. ", "12569 As noted in my July 14th, 2015 Phase I intervention with my colleagues Rathi, Evaniew and Gareau-Brennan, the Commission has demonstrated policy leadership, which, according to the ITU is an essential ingredient for national broadband. I want to thank the Commission again for showing this leadership. ", "12570 Our Phase 1 intervention, along with our Response to Requests for Further Information from the CRTC on September 21, 2015, outlines our responses to the Notice of Consultation in which we suggest four key elements: facilitating access to transport/backbone facilities; subsidies to incent and ensure broadband penetration for rural and remote communities and individuals; mechanisms to ensure affordable access for low income individuals; and, funding for skills development or digital literacy.", "12571 I want to use my time today to discuss two of these four elements in detail, and draw connections with comments from several other intervenors and the Let\u2019s Talk Broadband Findings Report from EKOS. My choice to focus my comments on broadband penetration for rural and remote communities and funding for digital literacy is not meant to suggest that the other two elements of the intervention are not important; however, as noted in my September 21st response, I'm cognizant of the fact that CRTC faces an extensive array of comments, and, ", "12572 \u201cWe are reasonably amenable to modifying our proposal so long as the primary purpose is that ensuring\u2026our primary objectives, overcoming the digital divides and ensuring universal, high-speed, affordable broadband, are met.\u201d", "12573 In regards to digital literacy, I want to begin by noting that the Commission itself identified digital literacy as a potential barrier to meaningful participation in the digital economy in its Notice of Consultation. ", "12574 As we noted in our Phase I intervention, digital literacy should be conceived broadly, and not simply skills for using the internet. Demand side factors are an important element for the Commission to consider. It should be considered to include knowledge such as how to understand, troubleshoot, and maintain networks.

The First Mile Connectivity Consortium notes, ", "12579 \u201cBasic telecommunications services available in rural, remote, and northern areas must also be of high quality, and digital literacy skills must be promoted, both for consumers and in terms of local management and operation of telecommunications infrastructures and services.\u201d ", "12580 Roslyn Layton states, ", "12581 \u201cRegulators should think more broadly about defining what digital literacy means for Canadians and how specifically Canadians are to participate meaningfully.\u201d ", "12582 Tamara Shepherd underscores the importance of considering demand side policies for lower income, senior, or disadvantaged users who have specific reasons for non-adoption. Concerns over digital literacy are also expressed by Xplornet, which claimed, ", "12583 \u201cIf the Commission can play a meaningful role in promoting digital literacy, that may be an appropriate area for action.\u201d ", "12584 The Cree Nation Government in its intervention specifically recommended funding for project-specific digital literacy and training activities.

The demand side of broadband, and specifically digital literacy, must be considered by the Commission as an aspect of basic telecommunications services. ", "12588 The importance of digital literacy is also reflected in the findings of the Let\u2019s Talk Broadband report by EKOS. In the representative survey, while only a small number of Canadians -- two percent -- noted that lack of skills or training was the main reason they had limited their use of the internet, nearly one quarter -- 24 percent -- noted that it was an \u201cother reason\u201d for limiting use. ", "12589 Given that so many Canadians identify digital literacy as a factor limiting use, and the Commission\u2019s stated interest in examining what services Canadians require to participate meaningfully in the digital economy, the Commission should consider digital literacy as an essential aspect of basic telecommunication services. ", "12590 With regards to rural and remote broadband, comments on its importance have appeared extensively in the interventions, and even today and yesterday at the hearings. ", "12591 I would like to take my remaining time to underscore some of the findings from the Let\u2019s Talk Broadband Report that demonstrate the critical importance of enhancing rural and remote connectivity. This report underscores that rural Canadians face limitations in terms of access to key services such as healthcare and education. Individuals have lost out on employment opportunities and scholarships. The report notes that in once case an individual had family members in southern Ontario send flash drives with large files to them through the mail. This certainly doesn\u2019t constitute meaningful participation in the digital economy. ", "12592 Finally, many of the participants noted that they can\u2019t seek out other service providers because they simply don\u2019t exist. This last comment is particularly insightful as it reinforces the point from our original intervention that in many rural and remote regions market forces simply don\u2019t exist, and as such can\u2019t be relied upon to encourage the development of broadband services. ", "12593 Given the lack of market forces, we have suggested that local communities and governments be empowered to develop their own solutions. As detailed in our September 21 response, funding local governments and giving them the decision making capacity to either a) develop their own community owned networks, b) create public-private partnerships, or c) rely on the private sector is a means of reducing the regulatory burden of the CRTC while encouraging rural and remote broadband development. These funds should be made available by revising the National Contribution Fund. ", "12594 It will also be necessary to ensure that rural and remote communities have access to transport infrastructure to ensure that locally developed solutions do not face bottlenecks in terms of interconnections. ", "12595 As we have suggested in cases where local governments are unwilling or incapable to develop plans, access to funds should be opened up to telecommunication services providers via a competitive bidding process. ", "12596 To conclude, I want to emphasize that the Commission has stated its interests in examining which telecommunication services are necessary to meaningfully participate in the digital economy. Meaningful participation is only capable when communities and individuals possess access to broadband infrastructure and have the requisite skills to make use of such infrastructure. ", "12597 Many Canadians lack the prerequisites for meaningful participation, and addressing issues including access to transport or backbone infrastructure, ensuring rural and remote broadband penetration, affordable access for low-income individuals, and digital literacy skills is crucial. ", "12598 I again want to thank the Commission for its role in addressing these issues. ", "12599 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much, Mr. McNally. ", "12600 Commissioner MacDonald will start us off. ", "12601 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good afternoon. I think I want to start off by asking about your research into what other countries are doing on this very topic. And in your intervention you describe access to fibre as the gold standard that we should be -- what should be striving for, and obviously there are inherent benefits to fibre over some other technologies. ", "12602 But I just want to get your sense on how realistic a full fibre deployment across the country would be. I notice that you, in your intervention, provide a table comparing where various different countries are in their own broadband rollouts, and Canada is definitely not towards the top of that scale, but we're being compared to companies -- to countries like Japan, for example, which has many more people than we do and is roughly -- well, it's actually smaller than Atlantic Canada. So can you comment on how realistic full fibre would be? ", "12603 MR. McNALLY: I think getting to full fibre, connecting every single last community, particularly in the north, is perhaps at best, an aspirational goal. That being said, in terms of the research that we've been doing and looking at other countries, we do see a large push by countries to develop strong targets, in terms of, you know, the U.S. in connecting 100 million households to 100 megabytes per second. ", "12604 The Australians, they've, however, have significantly scaled back their program. I had the good fortune of being involved in a meeting with some officials from Covage, which is Axia's French subsidiary, and they were discussing their deployment of fibre in France. The price tag was 40 billion Euros. We had to check translation a couple of times to make sure that that was billions and not millions. ", "12605 So I think is connecting every community to fibre a realistic goal? In the short-to-medium term, certainly not, but I think one of the things we can do is try and develop the capacity within local communities so that they can build solutions that best work for them, which I think in many cases, if we let them decide and inform them, it may be fibre. ", "12606 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You also suggest that we may want to adopt similar speed targets as the FCC has done south of the border, 25 down, 3 meg up. Do you view that as being a hard regulatory target that should be met or would that be more of an aspirational goal? ", "12607 MR. McNALLY: I think the challenge that you face is you\u2019ve got at one hand what you want to get everyone to, and on the other hand, what do we really want to have communities have? ", "12608 And I think that certainly 25/3 is reasonable in many non-satellite dependent communities. If a community is satellite dependent, that defines its abilities. It's dependent on satellite technology and therefore other options aren't simply available.", "12609 What I think one of the challenges is, if we set a very achievable goal, whether it's 5/1, 10/1, 10/3, do we end up taking these communities that are not connected at this point and setting them up so that they will only get 10/1 or 10/3? And so the challenge is how can we encourage communities to effectively leapfrog?", "12610 And for good of context, I do a lot of work in Alberta. I've been part of the Van Horne Institute\u2019s series of digital futures meetings and we've really seen over the past several years Olds, Alberta being held out as an example that\u2019s, you know, rather than relying on the existing service providers, it went with its own community developed solution and now I know individuals there who are getting 100 gigs at work.", "12611 So how can we develop a strategy where we set a baseline for basic services, yet we don't disincentivize communities from going much further ahead? And that's one of the challenges that I really observed within Alberta in particular.", "12612 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You noted in your opening remarks this afternoon that we should be creating an environment where communities can go out and develop their own broadband infrastructure. Some communities across the country have already done that quite successfully and others have not even looked at the issue.", "12613 Why do you think some municipalities are so resistant to the idea of funding broadband networks and getting into that business themselves?", "12614 MR. McNALLY: One of the things -- and I'm drawing on my work here from being involved with the Van Horne Institute and the Digital Futures, and I should also note that I'm doing some work with Economic and Development and Trade Department of the Government of Alberta, is there's simply a lack of knowledge and understanding sometimes at the community leaders level and sometimes at the citizens level.", "12615 In some cases, the citizens, \u201cWell, I have internet. I don\u2019t understand, you know, what better internet is going to do. I can talk to my grandkids. You know, I can order things online. It doesn\u2019t need to be any better.\u201d", "12616 And that's where this kind of broad understanding or broad emphasis on digital literacy is about, in part building capacity in communities so that they can kind of engage in these discussions and say, \u201cWe have maybe an existing service provider. Do we want to take a municipal initiative and spend more money to build a better solution?\u201d", "12617 In many cases, they don\u2019t have the information to inform that discussion but we know that the communities are facing challenges. The MP from Pontiac this morning talks about youth retention and that's a major issue in rural communities and it's also an issue for urban Canadians because we can't simply depopulate all the rural areas of Canada and send them all to the big cities because we'll face sprawl and growth and other issues that way.", "12618 So I think, you know, why have some communities done better, because in some cases they see a more urgent need to do something to revitalize their community and that's often broadband. I think both the MPs this morning did a good job of illustrating that.", "12619 And in other cases, there may be more pressing issues. You know, it's one of the discussions I often hear in the Alberta context is, you know, you talk about municipal broadband project and someone will say, \u201cWell, that's a hockey arena or a swimming pool\u201d, and for a lot of communities particularly in rural Alberta, that hockey arena, new hockey arena is a pretty important piece of infrastructure as well.", "12620 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: We had a presentation last week I believe from a municipality here in the country and they had underserviced citizens but they hadn\u2019t put any focus at least to date or any money behind building out or encouraging any infrastructure to be built out.", "12621 So I went on and I looked at the most recent budget that I could find, which admittedly was from a couple of years ago, and I noted that they spent $12.9 million upgrading parks in that fiscal year.", "12622 So how can we encourage local communities or regional municipalities to prioritize broadband infrastructure versus the hockey rink or the new park or other priorities?", "12623 MR. McNALLY: I think one of the key things that can be done is providing information particularly around the business models that are available to communities.", "12624 So through the work that the Van Horne Institute has been doing and now in conjunction with the Government of Alberta, we're developing information around five business models for community broadband.", "12625 And so these exist all the way from the kind of find the -- encourage the private sector partner to come in and so we have examples of that in Alberta. We have fibre builds. Axia is doing fibre builds in Vulcan, Alberta, and that is the lowest risk, lowest cost option for a municipal or city or regional government, conversely all the way up to build the and operate the network which was the approach in Olds.", "12626 So what we're doing is trying to identify how the spectrum of models that exist in between those two points so that we can provide that information and I think a national initiative that the CRTC could undertake to provide such information to communities would go a long way in facilitating community developments.", "12627 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So with respect to national initiatives and the focus of this hearing is quite broad, are there any best practices you can draw on from other countries as to how all of these stakeholders are brought together, be they provincial, municipal or federal government, different agencies, the regulator, the service providers? How do we bring all of those groups together and who is best to lead that exercise in the development of a broadband strategy?", "12628 MR. McNALLY: I think it's difficult to generalize from other nations\u2019 experiences but certainly I mean here in the Canadian context -- and I should note when I wrote my initial comments on policy leadership, it was the summer of last year, I will acknowledge the federal government, the new federal government, of course, has announced 500 million.", "12629 That overarching leadership must come from government. I've heard the Chairman today talk about willingness to work together with Innovation, Science and Economic Development, but I think at the same you've got to facilitate the solutions from the bottom up.", "12630 One of the things we've discovered is, you know, often the locally developed solutions are the most effective but there's often a capacity gap in getting local or regional groups to kind of make decisions.", "12631 And, you know, just thinking of Rogers\u2019 presentation earlier, I think a national task force is perhaps a useful idea for, you know, getting a little bit of momentum. However, you look at the National Broadband Task Force and we were to have universal 1.5 down internet by 2004 and we still don\u2019t. And you look at the Telecommunications Policy Review panel and we were to have ubiquitous internet by 2010 and we still don\u2019t.", "12632 So a national blue-ribbon panel may not be the best approach but trying to catalyze conversations from lower level regional governments, provincial governments, federal governments, along with the telcos, independent non-governmental organizations, the academic community, and those can be done by any number of ways, including this hearing to some extent.", "12633 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: When you're suggesting builds, facilities builds, are you targeting those just at unserved and underserviced regions, or you're suggesting that infrastructure be overbuilt where there already is service today?", "12634 MR. McNALLY: My suggestion in terms of funding for capital costs for new builds would be for underserved communities.", "12635 Now, part of that may be -- depending on how one defines basic services, there may be communities that have very low speed broadband now becoming then considered underserved. And certainly the kind of proposals we've sketched out is, you know, fund the capital cost of the connection from that community, a local point of presence, back to transport infrastructure, make that conditional on having the community develop some sort of plan, then to build last mile connections, and whether that\u2019s partnering with the private sector or doing it themselves or some combination in between, that would be an option, and then we\u2019ve noted that there should be a small remittance for operational costs in any community that is a single service provider regardless of who that service provider is.", "12636 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So in that regard, with the focus on transport, it would be similar to the Axia presentation that we heard from a few days ago with respect to funding the build of transport capacity and then leaving the last mile access up to market forces?", "12637 MR. McNALLY: Leaving the last mile up to market forces where markets exist. In those areas that are considerably underserved or have no broadband then there\u2019s no market forces there to have activated and there\u2019s a need for intervention. ", "12638 And I think the people best suited to make the decision as to what that type of broadband may look like in that community are the local citizens. They may say \u201cWe\u2019re willing to endure a local higher cost and we\u2019ll take care of that last mile fibre connection\u201d, or they may say \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see if we can get a third party to do it\u201d, or they may say \u201cWell, we\u2019d rather build fixed wireless\u201d, or \u201cWe\u2019d rather, you know, go some other route.\u201d ", "12639 So I think in many ways the key to those underserved and unconnected communities lies in the communities themselves and giving them the information and the decision making power and a little bit of funding to make their -- whatever they decide in terms of broadband come through.", "12640 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just to change topics for a minute. How do you define affordability?", "12641 MR. McNALLY: Affordability is obviously relative to one\u2019s income. So, as I noted in my September 21st response, ideally this issue of affordability could be addressed through a tax expenditure. You simply report your income, an internet provider could provide you with a set of alphanumeric digits to describe your broadband package, and then CRA could calculate your broadband expenditure relative to your income and whatever potential tax expenditure or tax credit you may qualify for. Of course that\u2019s far outside of your regulatory purview.", "12642 So, in that regard, I think, looking at affordability for something like broadband, I would compare it to other utilities, so things like gas, water and electricity. I think electricity is a very strong parallel for broadband.", "12643 If you look at Statistics Canada data on expenditures for utilities, those three utilities are roughly one percent each of either household income or household expenditure, and so broadband roughly should be again one percent of household income or household expenditure, and that paying it or connecting it to either average household expenditure or average household income would allow you -- you could vary it then in geographic areas where there\u2019s higher or lower average incomes or average household expenditures.", "12644 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So the one percent that you described, that would be just for broadband, that\u2019s not a total expenditure on communications services? That doesn\u2019t include landline, that doesn\u2019t include wireless; the one percent is just for broadband?", "12645 MR. McNALLY: Yes, the one percent would be for wireline broadband and wouldn\u2019t include other services.", "12646 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Should any special, be they discounts on the part of the service providers or any additional funding through like a funding mechanism suggested by AAC, should that be targeted in addition to low income people also to people with disabilities?", "12647 MR. McNALLY: I\u2019m struggling to answer the question because they\u2019re obviously connected. Disability and -- I would like to know the degree to which disability and income -- lower income are connected.", "12648 To give a remark, at this point I would say yes, it should be extended to people with disabilities, although I think there -- it could merit further analysis as well.", "12649 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. You had suggested taking -- the funds can be made available through the National Contribution Fund to fund broadband services to unserved Canadians. Are you suggesting that we would no longer want to fund the deployment of wireline telephone in high cost serving areas?", "12650 MR. McNALLY: Yes, I think repurposing the National Contribution Fund so that it targets broadband and no longer wireline telephone and focusing it on underserved and rural areas would be kind of the principal drive.", "12651 You could -- I\u2019m more than willing to acknowledge that you could also use it for high cost areas as well, areas where there\u2019s high cost of broadband. Those are likely to be underserviced areas anyway. So I don\u2019t think there would be much difference in those two.", "12652 But certainly yes, take the NCF, expand the eligible funds to include wireline, broadband, and also wireless broadband under the argument that if you\u2019re going to spend part of these funds on enhancing the digital literacy skills of Canadians and really driving, you know, a meaningful culture of use around the internet, that that will have benefits for the wireless providers in terms of increased usage which they can then capitalize on.", "12653 So, yes, expanding the eligible funds to cover a broader range of funds and then funneling it to fund both underserved kind of rural and remote areas, ensuring backbone connections, digital literacy, and some means of support for low income and disabled Canadians.", "12654 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: With respect to expanding the collection of those funds to include other services, what happens when peoples\u2019 bills go up; do you think Canadians are willing and eager to spend a few bucks more a month to ensure broadband services for their fellow Canadians in more remote areas?", "12655 MR. McNALLY: I think there is mixed evidence for that. I think if you look at the Lets Talk broadband findings you do see that there is some -- some Canadians are willing to support, you know, relatively equal costs of broadband in rural areas. ", "12656 There\u2019s also some -- to some degree a question of whether there\u2019s a public good argument that overrides the individual -- interested individual Canadians.", "12657 I see -- I think the analogous technology for broadband is not the telephone it\u2019s electricity. It\u2019s an underlying enabling technology. And if we don\u2019t start facilitating and ensuring broadband universally those communities that don\u2019t have it will be left a generation -- a century behind.", "12658 And so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always necessary that individual Canadians be the decision makers. I think in some cases there are broader public good arguments that need to carry the day.", "12659 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So if funding is required, is that a decision best made by -- through regulation, a decision made by five people sitting here that no one voted for, or is it better made by instituting tax measures that are decided on by 338 elected officials across the river?", "12660 MR. McNALLY: Ideally, I should not be here, because I think -- I think you\u2019re right. I think in a perfect world government expenditures would be well-suited to cover this. I know you don\u2019t have regulatory authority over spectrum. The revenues from spectrum auctions would seem well suited to fund other broadband deployment. Ideally digital literacy should not be the primary responsibility of the CRTC; it should be Employment and Skills Development Canada and to a lesser extent CMEC, the Canadian Ministers of Education Canada.", "12661 However, there is in some ways a little bit of a vacuum. ESDC has a little bit around computer skills but they do not really emphasize digital literacy to the same extent they provide funding for literacy and numeracy. And so there is a little bit of that vacuum where we need policy leadership. ", "12662 And in this case you yourselves have demonstrated that leadership and I think, you know, certainly continue conversations with the government. I mean, ideally they should be the ones leading this. But I think the National Contribution Fund certainly has some potential to provide funding in the meantime, to facilitate connections for rural and low-income Canadians. ", "12663 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you. And your answer actually bridged into digital literacy, which was going to be my next question. So I just have one more question on digital literacy before I hand you back over to my colleagues.", "12664 What do you think the Commission should do on that topic? Should we encourage, should we strongly encourage digital literacy enhanced programs on the part of the service providers, perhaps educational bodies from across the country from stepping up and offering digital literacy courses? What do you think we should do to ensure that there\u2019s more of a focus placed on that in the future?", "12665 MR. McNALLY: I think of you look at it there\u2019s a lot of digital literacy that goes on nowadays by various institutes, I mean, in schools, in libraries. And so I think the best suggestion would be to really kind of encourage those particular ESDC, Employment and Skills Development Canada, CMEC, provincial library associations to really take a keen interest in digital literacy. Many are already doing that.", "12666 I think the other two pieces, and again, considering digital literacy very broadly, not just how to use a computer, how to use the internet, the digital literacy around how to build a network and, you know, what kind of benefits broadband might bring to a community, I think that might be work that the Commission can kind of spearhead and encourage provincial governments to partner with and provide that to communities. ", "12667 And I think as well, I know the First Mile Connectivity Consortium has talked about the importance of digital literacy around the kind of more technical aspects of operating broadband networks. And I think that\u2019s a really important gap that needs to be addressed because by developing that kind of technical capacity in communities it reduces the cost for everyone. Whether it\u2019s an existing telecom provider now has a local pool of knowledge that they can draw on and they don\u2019t necessarily have to fly experts or technicians in from further away, or if it\u2019s a community-developed initiative then they have kind of local expertise. ", "12668 So I think that kind of traditionally conceived digital literacy I think is the Commission\u2019s job to really push the existing stakeholders to take on a stronger role. But those kind of less traditional things like community knowledge about broadband networks and the business models around how rural and remote communities can develop broadband, I think there\u2019s some role for the Commission to play a little bit more of a substantive role, at least in the early days on and certainly encourage and work with provincial partners. ", "12669 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, thank you very much. Those are my questions.", "12670 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "12671 Commissioner Vennard?", "12672 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions that I would like you to sort of explore with me. ", "12673 As the Commissioner for Alberta, I\u2019m interested in your research and what you\u2019ve heard through your work and so on. And I\u2019m presuming that you\u2019ve heard about the different pockets of unserved people, and gaps, and stranded people, and so on. And I\u2019m curious to see from your point of view and what you know and have researched on this, do you think that we have that problem in Alberta?", "12674 MR. McNALLY: Yes. Even if you look at the coverage map and Alberta comes out very well, we still have pockets of communities where they are underserved and, as Commissioner MacDonald, really have no interest in -- they haven\u2019t gotten to the point where they\u2019ve said this is a problem and we need to solve it.", "12675 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you think that it\u2019s the same sort of problem as we\u2019ve heard described where the service goes out to a certain point and then there\u2019s a dead zone there? In Alberta there are communities that are underserved or possibly even -- I\u2019m wondering if you think it\u2019s the same dynamic in Alberta or if you think that the SuperNet, the actual idea of the SuperNet, has alleviated some of that problem as we start to think about potential solutions and strategies and so on? I\u2019m looking at what you might think the value of the SuperNet would be in that type of a situation. ", "12676 MR. McNALLY: The SuperNet certainly gets one a long way there in terms of potential. But once you start to move kind of outside of communities into, you know, the farm, and when the next closest farm is two kilometres down the road and the next closest farm is three kilometres down the road, those are very challenging pockets to address.", "12677 I mean, the Government of Alberta has tried with satellite to address some of that in some ways. You know, my kind of belief is if we go to those farms and they have gas and water, well, maybe they wouldn\u2019t have running water. They may have gas and electricity. If we can run gas and electricity to those farms and fibre is, in comparison, a relatively cheap utility, especially if you have existing infrastructure, certainly how can we get those last few places connected?", "12678 But yes, there\u2019s a problem of remote connections at the end of the day, and I think that\u2019s ---", "12679 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Which the problem of remoteness I think is a little bit different than people that are just sort of stranded.", "12680 MR. McNALLY: I would agree. I think that the remoteness, and the stranded, and the satellite-dependent communities pose a real challenge in terms of thinking about basic telecommunication services. Because obviously if you\u2019re making a statement or declaration about a basic service that all must have then that\u2019s got to be something that works for those individuals or households, and yet that comes back to the idea of, well, if we have to go to that lowest common denominator do we end up actually underserving everyone else?", "12681 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. The second thing I wanted to talk to you about is about the five models that you mentioned. And those are business models. I presume they\u2019re also deployment models for broadband, both for new services as well as expanding services and so on.", "12682 And I\u2019m presuming that -- and here I\u2019m making a long list of presumptions -- that you developed these models from your research and literature reviews and so on and looking at the international level and that. And I\u2019m further presuming you\u2019re probably writing a paper on it; would that be correct?", "12683 MR. McNALLY: So with regards to the business models, I want to acknowledge the work of Bob Dyrda who\u2019s at Alberta Southwest who\u2019s really been a key participant in a lot of the Digital Futures conversations. And he has actually done a lot of work on developing at least initial sketches of those models. What\u2019s now happening is, in partnership with the Government of Alberta, we are writing up a toolkit for communities that will flesh out those business models with examples. Wherever possible, Albertan Canadian, and then in some cases U.S. examples. ", "12684 And so, yes, there will be two publications kind of come of that. One is the toolkit designed for communities to use and the other being the academic research paper that will go into the more traditional ---", "12685 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: When might those papers be available for people?", "12686 MR. McNALLY: Unfortunately the timeline for the toolkit is -- it won\u2019t be ready until October at the next Digital Futures. That being said, I can check with my colleague Mr. Dyrda. He gave a presentation at the last Digital Futures in March. If he would be willing to chair his presentation slides I would then be willing to pass those on to the Commission.", "12687 But again, I can\u2019t guarantee that ---", "12688 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure.", "12689 MR. McNALLY: -- he would speak with ---", "12690 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And I won\u2019t ask you for an undertaking. I\u2019ll just ask you if you\u2019re able to share those with us if you would.", "12691 MR. McNALLY: I will. I will indeed.", "12692 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. My final question is along the same line. Within those models, and I\u2019m not even going to ask you to describe them because you\u2019re obviously not ready to talk about them yet and that\u2019s fine. ", "12693 Would there be -- would this be of use to Canada, the north? Might there be some deployment models there that would be useful in trying to take on some of the challenges that we've been hearing about in the north? ", "12694 MR. McNALLY: So these models would be useful in many communities, I think. In some northern communities, there isn't -- you could build the fibre infrastructure and there's nowhere to connect that fibre infrastructure backbone to. You'd run into a bottleneck issue. ", "12695 And the other, of course, if you have a satellite-dependent community, then by definition, it's satellite-dependent. But there's certainly nothing stops these models from being applicable in many regions of the country and not just -- there's nothing uniquely Albertan about them. ", "12696 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so even -- we've heard a bit about the challenges in different areas of Quebec and so on where they have the stranded problem and they have, you know, deployment problems and so on. So okay, well, we will certainly look forward to seeing those when they're available. ", "12697 Thank you. Those are all my questions.", "12698 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just polling my colleagues. Apparently, those are all our questions. Are you actually physically based normally in Alberta? ", "12699 MR. McNALLY: Yes.", "12700 THE CHAIRPERSON: And you\u2019ve come for this hearing? ", "12701 MR. McNALLY: I've come for this hearing. ", "12702 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, you be commended for having done that. Thank you very much. It was very (inaudible). ", "12703 MR. McNALLY: I want to thank the Commission for having the hearings. ", "12704 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. I think what we'll do, because next Panel is rather large as well and we're probably due for a break, so why don\u2019t we come back at 3:45? Thank you. ", "--- Upon recessing at 3:34 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 3:48 p.m.", "12705 THE CHAIRPERSON: A l\u2019ordre. Order please.", "12706 Madame la secr\u00e9taire.", "12707 THE SECRETARY: We will now hear the presentation of MTS Inc. ", "12708 Please introduce yourself and your colleagues, and you have 15 minutes. ", "PRESENTATION", "12709 MS. TULK: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Chairman Blais, Vice-chair Menzies, and commissioners. ", "12710 My name is Heather Tulk and I am the Chief Customer Officer at MTS. With me today, starting at my far right is Hong Chung, our Director of Network Technology; Patricia Solman, our Senior Vice-President of Network and Field Services; Paula Anderson, our Director of Wire Line Products; Paul Norris, our Vice-President of Residential Solutions; and Grainne Grande, our Director of Regulatory. ", "12711 I'll start with the opening remarks and then the whole team will be ready to answer your questions when I'm finished.", "12712 On Monday, Chairman Blais asked remaining parties to address some key issues regarding broadband internet access. We will do that, but before we discuss broadband, we are compelled to make a couple of points with respect to other matters that have been raised during this proceeding. ", "12713 First, reliable high quality basic voice service and the regulatory regime that provides for it remains essential to many Canadians and should not be altered. ", "12714 Second, if a local service subsidy is prematurely phased out or eliminated, so too should be the obligation to serve the basic service objective and the cap on residential primary exchange service rates. ", "12715 Let's start with the first point, that reliable high quality wire line voice service is a requirement that is still essential and relevant to millions of Canadians today. ", "12716 Throughout Canada, emergency, government, and Social Services can all be accessed using basic voice and for many Canadians, basic voice remains the chosen method to do so. Without access to basic voice, some residents could be cut off from all basic communications, including emergency services as well as services such as banking, education, and government services. ", "12717 Simply said, basic voice is integral to allowing many vulnerable Canadians to participate in the economic and social fabric of their communities. Any premature changes to the basic voice services regulatory regime will have a disproportionate and adverse impact on rural and remote customers in high-cost serving areas in Manitoba, and indeed across Canada. ", "12718 In our case, Manitoba has a unique and challenging geography. It is one of the lowest population densities among the provinces in Canada, with an average of only 2.2 people per square kilometre. Even more significant is that 88 percent of Manitoba's land mass contains just 13 percent of Manitoba's population, leaving the 88 percent of Manitoba with a -- that 88 percent of Manitoba with a population density of only .31 people per square kilometre. ", "12719 We estimate that currently 24 percent of all residential lines in Manitoba are in high-cost serving areas. This is almost two and a half times greater than the national average of 10 percent. ", "12720 MTS, in fact, serves a disproportionately large number of these high cost lines. Approximately 37 percent of our residential wire line telephone service customers are on rate bands E, F, and G. Manitobans in these high cost serving areas depend on this basic telecommunication service. Given this dependency, the regulatory regime underpinning basic voice is crucial. ", "12721 This regulatory regime has been well-examined, tried, and proven. Just five years ago, it was the subject of an in-depth review by the Commission. The Commission's decision at that time struck the right balance and resulted in a just and reasonable outcome for Canadians. One of the main features of that decision is the acknowledgement of the importance of the voice subsidy mechanism and the affirmation that the subsidy should remain in place, given that it was designed to decline naturally over time. ", "12722 To the Commission's credit, this mechanism is doing exactly what it was intended to do. Since 2010, the subsidy regime has already seen the required subsidy decline by 35 percent, and this trend is expected to continue. ", "12723 Turning to my second point, any accelerated phase out or elimination of a local service subsidy would need to be accompanied by a corresponding reduction or elimination of the obligation to serve the basic service objective and the cap on residential rates on these areas. Changing one part of this equation without changing the others would disrupt the carefully crafted balance of this naturally declining mechanism. ", "12724 Removing the subsidy mechanism would lead to a need for price increases well beyond the established price cap, making basic voice unaffordable for many Canadians. This in turn will lead to customers being forced to drop this essential service. Since the costs of providing local service are largely fixed, the cost per subscriber will increase even more as these customers leave, resulting in the need to raise rates even further for those remaining. ", "12725 The Telecommunications Act expressly states that every rate charge by a Canadian carrier for telecommunications services should be just and reasonable. The 2011 proceeding extensively reviewed what a just and reasonable price cap would be, and we see no need to reopen that decision now. ", "12726 Under the obligation to serve, ILECs have no choice but to provide basic voice in high cost areas; however, no service provider should be forced to provide service below cost, meaning both the service levels and service obligation would need to be re-examined. The end result would be that a fundamental basic telecommunication service would no longer be affordable nor accessible for many Canadians in rural and remote regions. ", "12727 I will now turn my remarks to the broadband questions in front of the Commission in this proceeding. ", "12728 Mr. Chairman, earlier this week, you challenged the industry to provide input on a national broadband strategy. We agree that this proceeding provides an important opportunity to review the state of broadband services in Canada and the next steps. Market forces and rapid changes technology, together with targeted government funding, have had profound and positive effects on the availability of broadband services in the country. ", "12729 The vast majority of Canadians are able to access services at or near the target speeds established in 2011. As Chairman Blaine noted in his opening remarks at this hearing, 96 percent of Canadians had access to internet download speeds of at least 5 megabits per second at the end of 2014. As of the end of 2014, in Manitoba, 98 percent of households had access to fixed broadband and 95 percent had fixed broadband available to them at speeds from 5 to 9.9 megabits per second. ", "12730 Commissioners, I'm delighted to say that I was part of the roll out of some of the first broadband networks in Canada in the late 1990s, and I am, in fact, very proud of the fact that in just 15 years, broadband services are now available to 96 percent of Canadians. ", "12731 Significant progress has been made. The industry has actively responded to market demands, governments have been active partners, and substantial benefits of broadband are being delivered to the vast majority of Canadians. Yet we share the belief that gaps in broadband coverage still persist and the work must continue. ", "12732 We believe that universal broadband access is a worthy and important policy objective, and we are delighted that industry, governments, and other stakeholders continue to step up in pursuit of this goal. There is a well-established track record of successful government and industry partnerships to drive broadband coverage. Canary, the Broadband for Rural and Northern Development or BRAND program, and Broadband Canada are just some of the examples, and they go way back. ", "12733 And this work continues. Since 2014 the federal government's $305 million Connecting Canadians program has been extending and enhancing broadband service to more than 300,000 rural, remote, and northern households, with a goal of connecting over 98 percent of Canadian households to new or improved high speed internet services. ", "12734 Most recently, we were delighted to see that in budget 2016 the federal government committed to spend an additional $5 million over 5 years to extend and enhance broadband service to even more rural and remote communities.", "12735 The government also allocated $255 million over 2 years to the First Nations Infrastructure Fund, which can be used towards broadband connectivity.", "12736 Several provincial governments have also pledged funds to promote broadband deployment across rural and remote Canada, signalling a clear intention to continue to act.", "12737 We believe that this sustained approach will ultimately lead to near universal access to broadband in Canada, without any need to impose a basic service obligation. Moreover, it is an approach that is more efficient and proportionate to the purpose than others that might be considered, since it allows for a narrower focus on only those areas where market forces are not sufficient to ensure adequate deployment and where communities are actively involved in the solution.", "12738 In Manitoba we know that many of the five percent of households that do not yet have access to download speeds of five megabits per second live in challenging to serve rural and remote areas. These real challenges of broadband deployment must not be overlooked.", "12739 Caution must also be taken to ensure that in the desire to increase target speeds, the goal of universal coverage is not displaced. Real trade-offs are being made between investments to increase speed and investments to increase coverage. And we believe that we must first ensure all Canadians have access to broadband before we consider increasing the five and one targets.", "12740 The Commission\u2019s role in establishing broadband speed targets in Canada has struck the right balance of regulatory oversight. The five one speeds meet or exceed what is required for access to the essential services examined by the Commission in this proceeding.", "12741 With respect to economic access to broadband connectivity, we agree that it is not just availability but accessibility of broadband that is important to Canadians. Dealing with social issues impacting Canadians, such as affordability, are important. But we respectfully submit that this is an issue that should be addressed by social policy tools, as opposed to regulatory measures.", "12742 We believe that it is governments, not industry, that are in the best position to decide who should qualify for necessary assistance, and in what form that necessary assistance should be granted.", "12743 That being said, in Manitoba we see ourselves as an important community partner. We participate in numerous community initiatives and programs that are designed to address accessibility and digital literacy. Examples such as our ongoing consultation with various accessibility groups, delivery of technology tip seminars to train seniors and new Canadians in digital literacy, a Computers for Schools partnership, our leadership role in supporting the Canadian Centre for Child Protection\u2019s efforts to protect child and youth online, and as a co-founding partner of the Cybertip.ca program and the MPS Future First program, which in 2015 alone awarded $100,000 in grants to youth organizations, including over $40,000 to those supporting children with disabilities and indigenous youth.", "12744 Work with the Society for Manitobans for Disabilities has also been undertaken to develop and accessibility sensitivity training course that over 600 of our employees have already taken.", "12745 And Commissioners, this is just a few of the community initiatives supporting accessibility and digital literacy that we are involved in at MTS.", "12746 It is our position that the best strategies to eliminate the gaps in broadband connectivity are those strategies that target the specific needs to be filled. Each of these needs must be addressed by the party that is most appropriate to assess and fulfill it.", "12747 Effectively, this means that all stakeholders have a role to play. All levels of government from band councils straight through to the federal government, public interest groups, private sector and the CRTC. But this does not mean that there is a need for regulatory intervention.", "12748 What we are recommending today with respect to broadband we believe is consistent with all of the guiding principles of the National Broadband Taskforce of 2001 that you asked us all to consider.", "12749 In conclusion, it is our position that there is no need for regulatory intervention on broadband internet services, given that market forces, technology advancements and existing and new targeted government programs are reaching and filling the gaps that exist in broadband coverage.", "12750 The value of policy levers like this is that they can be tailored to the needs of a particular region or a particular group, rather than attempting a one size fits all solution.", "12751 This concludes our presentation and we are ready to take any questions you may have for us. Thank you.", "12752 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for that presentation. ", "12753 Commissioner Vennard will start us off.", "12754 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good afternoon.", "12755 There\u2019s a few areas that I want to explore with you today. And what I\u2019d like to do is just start off by pointing out that I think that there was a little bit of slippage in your written submission. Because we\u2019re looking at the digital economy, not just the economy. And you seemed to sort of drop that part out. In one part there you said that you encouraged us to think about participation in the economy. And we are here more focused on a digital economy and the way that digitization and networks fit into that; okay? So that\u2019s just something that I wanted to say.", "12756 Now your written submission is very complete. You presented your arguments with respect to wireline and voice and they form part of our records here. So what I want to do is just move into that area of looking at the digital economy, rather than just the economy, and move into the area of broadband. You also covered off the whole voice line very well in your opening remarks too.", "12757 So having said that, from your point of view, what are the basic services? And here I\u2019m not talking about the economy. I\u2019m talking about the digital economy; okay? What would be the basic services as they relate to the digital economy?", "12758 You mentioned some of them in your submission on point number 14 and 16. Is there anything that you would want to add to that?", "12759 MS. TULK: Well, I think that, you know, and I can pass it over to Grainne if she wants to add anything after. But certainly in our submission we articulated the things that we believe is necessary for Canadians to be able to access in order to participate in the knowledge and digital economy. And the services that are required to do that, which we said we believe can be met with a five one broadband access into the household.", "12760 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Could you be more specific on what services and uses you think are -- create a basic ---", "12761 MS. TULK: Where there\u2019s access to government services, banking, distance education, distance health applications. I think we articulated them. We don\u2019t really have anything to add beyond what we had in our submission.", "12762 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So in your senses and from your point of view, is there any difference between the economy and the digital economy? I just want to make sure that we\u2019re capturing that difference there because I consider that to be a fairly significant difference.", "12763 MS. TULK: Well, I guess I would say that the digital economy is a subset of the overall economy, however, more and more inextricably linked. However, I guess in the remarks that we were making, I don\u2019t think it was intended to be slippage. It was intended to point out that the demographics of Canada and, in fact, the east case in Canada, are such that although the economy and the digitization of the economy is certainly happening, there continues to be a large swap of Canadians who prefer to interact in the economy in more traditional ways.", "12764 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "12765 MS. TULK: And we don\u2019t believe that they should be left behind. And we don\u2019t believe that the time is right to assume that the digital economy replaces other ways of accessing and participating in the economy. So that was meant to be our point.", "12766 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "12767 MS. TULK: But certainly the digital economy is very important to Canadians, both in terms of current use and growth and --", "12768 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "12769 MS. TULK: -- that\u2019s why we believe, as we mentioned in this submission, that universal access to broadband at five one speeds is a reasonable goal.", "12770 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. And of course, that\u2019s exactly what I want to make sure that I\u2019m clear on is that we\u2019re looking at that -- what you\u2019re calling a subset. And that\u2019s precisely what we\u2019re focussed on because it\u2019s completely possible to participate in other areas of the economy without having that. But we\u2019re interested in that.", "12771 And so therefore, if you\u2019re going to participate, participate meaningfully in the digital economy, you have to have the means to be able to do that. And that, of course, obviously you have to have some sort of an infrastructure for that or technology for that. So that remains what our focus is.", "12772 Now, we\u2019re transitioning -- our society is transitioning in a lot of ways into that with our online banking and with health applications, education and so on and so forth. So do you see that as being something as very significant to your submission? Because you did make this distinction and that\u2019s why I\u2019m being very clear on the fact that we\u2019re dealing with one part of it and not the other part of it.", "12773 MS. TULK: Sorry. I\u2019m not sure if I follow the exact question there. ", "12774 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: I\u2019m just trying to be very clear that we\u2019re talking about this subset, which is a digital economy versus the other economy. And that we are becoming, as a society, more and more moving into the direction of the digital economy. Therefore, although from your point of view and the point of view of a lot of others, five one might be sufficient. But will it be sufficient in the future because we are thinking about things like speed and so on and so forth.", "12775 So really what I\u2019m trying to do is just get your thinking really sort of away from the voice and more onto this digital part of it.", "12776 Now what I\u2019d -- I\u2019ll just go back to a different, a second area that I just want to sort of clarify there. You state in your written submission that you believe that the competition is strong and pervasive in Canada, okay, when it comes to broadband internet access services. And that you don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any need for regulation. And that\u2019s accurate as to what you put to us?", "12777 MS. TULK: Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "12778 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. Okay, so therefore, clearly you\u2019ve also -- you\u2019re saying that you believe that the market forces are working well as well, and obviously including your own. I see that when I go on your website. I see that you have a lot of different services and things are moving along in a certain direction. So it seems like that would be a statement that would be sort of self-evident, okay? So your website indicates that, you know, you\u2019ve got a lot of expansion and so on going on there. ", "12779 Now because I\u2019m from Alberta, what I\u2019d like you to do -- and for the purposes of me really being able to understand the context within which your company operates, and your service area, and where your thinking comes from -- can you tell me about your service area? Can you tell me about your customers? Can you tell me about how many customers you serve, where they are?", "12780 MS. TULK: Yeah, I could go into quite a bit of detail on that. Obviously our serving area spans the entire province of Manitoba.", "12781 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. ", "12782 MS. TULK: We serve -- and I think a lot of this is, you know, in the records, you know, in the (inaudible) but we serve about 500,000 households across the Province of Manitoba. And also business customers as well, ranging from small business to enterprise and government customers across the provinces. ", "12783 We sell a wide range of services, including wireline voice, full set of mobility and wireless services, broadband services including internet and IPTV across various serving areas in the province. ", "12784 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And would you say that your -- so what percentage of your province would you say is covered, is served? Like, who\u2019s unserved? Tell me a bit about your unserved, underserved.", "12785 MS. TULK: Yeah. Specifically with respect to broadband I\u2019m assuming is your question?", "12786 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, correct.", "12787 MS. TULK: So in Manitoba, I believe it\u2019s in the Commission exhibits, currently about 95 percent have coverage between 5 and 10 and above megabits per second. And about 98 percent of households have access to up to 5 megabits and 1 megabit of download. Total coverage being about 95 percent of -- sorry, 95 percent of the province at 5 to 10 and 98 percent overall.", "12788 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Part of your customers are -- tell me about your customers. Are they also the MKO communities and so on?", "12789 MS. TULK: Yes, we serve all communities in Manitoba.", "12790 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. And their coverage is good? We certainly heard different things from the group that presented last week.", "12791 MS. TULK: That was ---", "12792 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Maybe can you tell me something about if you have challenges with them?", "12793 MS. TULK: Well, certainly Pat and Hong can add on that but we, you know, like every provider in Canada the service, and particularly every ILEC provider in Canada, our services have various characteristics and serve very specific communities.", "12794 And also, as I think you mentioned in your question, one of the presenters earlier today, limitations such as distance of a certain home from ---", "12795 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure.", "12796 MS. TULK: --- our switch and our serving area so the experience can vary by individuals. But specifically, you know, and Hong, I don\u2019t know if you want to add specifically to the MKO communities, the service in those?", "12797 MR. CHUNG: The MKO communities, there\u2019s about 30 of them, just about 30, and about half of them are remote fly-in sites. All of them we do provide voice services, but a small percentage of them get broadband internet services. And that largely has to do with the geography and the remoteness of the communities.", "12798 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So the numbers that you\u2019ve cited a few moments ago, the 95 percent, that includes these communities as well that you serve?", "12799 MR. CHUNG: Correct. Just to clarify, the 95 percent is the current coverage in Manitoba. It\u2019s not necessarily the same footprint that we serve for broadband. There are other competitors in the markets. There are wireless ISPs that serve northern communities as well.", "12800 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. What does the 95 percent represent then? What does that number mean?", "12801 MR. HUNG: That was the collective sum total of all carriers and coverages within -- all carrier coverage in Manitoba.", "12802 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And that\u2019s for broadband? ", "12803 MR. HUNG: That was broadband, yes.", "12804 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So there\u2019s 95 percent or 98 percent so virtually 100 percent.", "12805 I find that it\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s kind of interesting because further in your submission, if I look at -- if we look at point number 76, for example, you\u2019re serving many, or some at least -- you don\u2019t give a number here -- of rural and remote customers with ADSL technology that seems to be slower than a 5/1. Can you maybe reconcile that?", "12806 MS. TULK: So in our network we have a number of customers in DSL coverage, which of course is distance sensitive based on the speed. So the actual delivered speed can vary based on a number of characteristics, including the equipment in the home, including the quality of the line back to the CO, and including the distance from the central office or the CO. So that\u2019s why, you know, when as an example we advertise our entry-level services up to 5 megabits per second because those differences do deliver different experience to various customers. ", "12807 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Would you say that that -- first of all, how many of your customers or how many homes would be served by the ADSL? Percentage-wise even.", "12808 MR. CHUNG: It\u2019s about 85,000.", "12809 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: About 85,000. And they wouldn\u2019t be receiving then that speed, that 5/1 speed, would they?", "12810 MR. CHUNG: The challenge with ADSL is actually on the uplink. The current maximum speed, depending on vendor, is about 800 kilobits per second. Most of our equipment goes up to 768 kilobits per second.", "12811 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. ", "12812 MR. CHUNG: So that\u2019s really the bigger challenge. There are, to Heather\u2019s points, a few -- there are a percentage of customers that won\u2019t get the 5 as well due to loop length, but the real challenge is related to the uplink speed. ", "12813 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Do you have plans for replacing this legacy technology? We heard from the MKO group last week that they -- some of them, and not saying necessarily in your operating area, there\u2019s 80-some communities -- that they feel that they have outdated legacy technology and that it\u2019s not sufficient for their needs. ", "12814 And again, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s necessarily in yours but that was put to us. Do you have plans for changing that, for upgrading that, expanding that?", "12815 MS. TULK: Well, we provide broadband service to I believe nine of the MKO communities, and we\u2019ve actually been upgrading the broadband in -- there\u2019s four of them that we\u2019re addressing with known issues. ", "12816 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "12817 MS. TULK: I think we have three done. Is that right, Hong?", "12818 MR. CHUNG: We have one done and three more to come this year.", "12819 MS. TULK: One more -- three done. Or two more that will be done this year.", "12820 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So out of those roughly say 30 communities, nine of those are actually yours and you\u2019re looking at upgrading them already?", "12821 MS. TULK: Yes, that\u2019s right. The ones that require upgrading, yeah.", "12822 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. How is that coming along? Do you have times on that and so on?", "12823 MR. CHUNG: We\u2019re estimating this fall to have those three communities that we talked about ---", "12824 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So this fall.", "12825 MR. CHUNG: --- upgraded.", "12826 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So any concerns that that group might have had with respect to the groups and the communities that you serve that should be looked after by this fall, would you say? Yeah?", "12827 MR. CHUNG: Some of the communities we still are working through implementing plans to upgrade the rest.", "12828 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "12829 MR. CHUNG: There\u2019s no firm plans yet. We are still working through timing and schedule.", "12830 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I just wanted to make sure that we got that on the record.", "12831 But from your point of view then, the market forces are working well and there\u2019s no need for intervention?", "12832 MS. TULK: Well, I think that I guess meaning regulatory intervention. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a role for regulatory intervention. We are strong believers in the continued role of government and private sector partnerships ---", "12833 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "12834 MS. TULK: --- in finishing the job to get to the last, you know, the last five percent nationally, and in our region two percent. I think these are, you know, in the far north including in our province, but also across the north of Canada and in very rural and remote areas in virtually every province there are still unserved areas that we believe should be served. And I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll have them without government partnership.", "12835 And so things like the Connecting Canadians program, et cetera, I think those are really good programs and it\u2019s our hope that they\u2019ll continue as well as community involvement, municipal involvement, provincial involvement and, you know, forms of all public sector involvement. ", "12836 So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s regulatory intervention needed, but I think there\u2019s certainly importance of continued policy and funding intervention, as has been going on for the last number of years.", "12837 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes. ", "12838 So in terms of the funding, those targeted funding subsidies, do you want to make some comments on that? What you think has worked well for you -- ", "12839 MS. TULK: Well I think --", "12840 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- in your serving area?", "12841 MS. TULK: -- when you -- with respect to broadband, specifically the private partnerships, I\u2019d say that public partnerships and the government funding -- in fact I\u2019d say for MTS, we haven\u2019t been as successful with them as would have liked to have seen us.", "12842 And certainly our desire with the connecting Canadians program was to see more success in the future.", "12843 But they\u2019ve been successful insofar as they\u2019ve led to broadband being built out in these communities and so as a member of the industry I\u2019m a huge fan of that.", "12844 And I, you know, unfortunately we weren\u2019t the winning bidder to build that out, but the fact that they got built is I think a really good thing and something that we\u2019re very supportive of and hope to see continue.", "12845 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Well thank you for that. ", "12846 Now I\u2019ve talked -- before I move on to -- to another area there, I just want to get your views on the idea of stream being an entertainment and so on.", "12847 Do you see that as being something that\u2019s essential for people?", "12848 MS. TULK: Well I think it\u2019s certainly desired by people.", "12849 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: We keep asking people that question, because we\u2019re really interested in just sort of knowing what everybody thinks on that point. ", "12850 MS. TULK: Yes. ", "12851 I mean I think it\u2019s difficult to say that streaming, you know, Hollywood movies is an essential service for Canadians, but I think it\u2019s certainly something that\u2019s in high demand and wished for and aspired to for a lot of Canadians.", "12852 I think the good news is that the actual, you know, the compression and other technologies actually make the streaming services -- they work quite well at a 5 in 1. ", "12853 And so I think, you know, these customers that have access to broadband even at 5 can reasonably do that and, you know, so I think that\u2019s a good thing.", "12854 But it\u2019s hard for me to say that\u2019s an essential service when, you know, as you\u2019ve heard from some of the other witnesses today, when you look at the needs of vulnerable and marginalized Canadians in many, many different ways, to say that we should be in the business of ensuring every Canadian has the ability to stream high bandwidth movies when every Canadian doesn\u2019t have access to potable water is probably a stretch for me in the definition of essential service.", "12855 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes, yes. ", "12856 But yet on the other hand too, the bandwidth required to stream a movie is, you know, the bandwidth is the bandwidth. ", "12857 If you\u2019re using it for a health application or if you\u2019re watching Netflix on it --", "12858 MS. TULK: And that\u2019s great.", "12859 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- you\u2019re still using it. ", "12860 MS. TULK: Yes.", "12861 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So I mean there\u2019s that argument that we\u2019ve heard quite a few times too, that what the content should be not relevant --", "12862 MS. TULK: Yes.", "12863 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- in terms of the ability to do it. ", "12864 MS. TULK: Yes.", "12865 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So having said that, do you think that we should be looking at an aspirational goal of some kind that would be higher on the upload part of things, for people who want to post their YouTube videos, upload their medical records, whatever?", "12866 MS. TULK: Yes, well I mean I guess in the uploading of medical records, most of what the average Canadian would need to do with respect to uploading medical records actually can be done quite well at 5 megabits; you know?", "12867 Not many individual Canadians are taking their own MRIs and uploading them, so I think that, you know, that most of what -- you know, as we\u2019ve said and we explored in our submission, most of what we see \u2013- being able to do, that fall within the realm of essential services, can be done with a \u2013- certainly a \u2013- you know even at the 7-60 range that we\u2019re able to deliver.", "12868 Even our ADSL communities upload and I think it came of one of Commissioner Molnar\u2019s questions earlier today, I think upload can be an issue, in fairness, for certain small businesses. ", "12869 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes. ", "12870 MS. TUSK: Depending on the industry that small business is in. The vast majority of small businesses it\u2019s not, but if you\u2019re, you know, an architect or someone who\u2019s doing high definition rendering or things like that, then it can be an issue, but for the vast majority of households and even businesses it\u2019s not an issue, even at the one. ", "12871 Is more speed better? Sure more speed is better. Down the road do I think these aspirational targets should continue to grow? I think they do -- or I think they should go forward in building. ", "12872 I think most people who are building now in new builds are looking at increasing speeds beyond 5 in 1 in those new builds. People aren\u2019t building the networks that only deliver that. ", "12873 However, you know, I guess our position would be that finishing the job on universality of access is a big -- should be a bigger policy priority then increasing the speed targets in the areas that are already served. ", "12874 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So what are -- what are your comments with respect to say small and medium sized businesses, possibly even home businesses? ", "12875 Your province is quite sparsely populated and I would venture a guess that there\u2019s probably a lot of people that work at home, use it for businesses purposes. ", "12876 So they might not be uploading their own, you know, X-rays or whatever, but they might be uploading a lot of other things that once again take a certain amount of capacity.", "12877 MS. TUSK: Yes and again, as I mentioned, for the vast majority of businesses the upload speed of 1 in the current aspirational target is more than adequate.", "12878 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "12879 Okay, now -- so you\u2019re quite sort of firm on the idea that there\u2019s no need to extend the basic service objective to broadband and to leave that out. ", "12880 And it seems that you, from your point of view, market forces are working and the communities are reasonably well serviced and if they\u2019re not then there are plans for it and this should be meeting peoples\u2019 needs.", "12881 So am I summarizing what we\u2019ve talked about so far? ", "12882 MS. TUSK: I think so, yes.", "12883 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "12884 MS. TUSK: I guess with the addition of the continued support of government funding mechanisms and partnerships. ", "12885 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes, I was going to get to that in a moment. ", "12886 MS. TUSK: Yes.", "12887 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So in \u2013- basically in your view there\u2019s not a whole lot of issues on things in your world?", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "12888 MS. TUSK: I think that -- I would certainly -- I mean there\u2019s a lot of issues that we ---", "12889 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: There\u2019s not a lot of issues that you want to tell me about.", "12890 MS. TUSK: There\u2019s a lot of issues that we deal with every day, but specifically to the availability of broadband.", "12891 As I said in the submission, when we look at the pace at which broadband has been rolled out in a country that has some of the most aggressively difficult to deal with geography and dispersion of population as Canada, I think in fact Canada, and the Commission, and Industry Canada, and all the players in the industry, should be rightfully proud of the work that we\u2019ve already done. ", "12892 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "12893 MS. TUSK: And more important, rightfully proud of the work that\u2019s continuing. ", "12894 You know, as I mentioned seeing in the recent Federal budget an increase in the funding available to continuing the job was something that we were delighted to see.", "12895 And, you know, we think that the industry is moving along very well and recognizing the importance of what\u2019s being done here and committed to finishing the job.", "12896 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "12897 MS. TUSK: So I guess that would be, you know, our position on that. ", "12898 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "12899 Now that leads me around to the question of course of money, that always enters into it, and affordability. ", "12900 Availability is one thing, it seems like you are fairly confident that you\u2019re serving your area well and there\u2019s not a lot of issues there.", "12901 What about affordability?", "12902 MS. TUSK: Yes. ", "12903 Well I think that certainly affordability for the vast majority of Canadians isn\u2019t an issue, as evidenced by the uptake on broadband that\u2019s occurred and penetration of broadband that\u2019s occurred in Canadian households across the country. ", "12904 Certainly there are vulnerable groups or segments of the population that I think affordability is a real issue for and I know you\u2019ve heard from them in some of the hearings today. ", "12905 However, as we said in our opening remarks, we\u2019re also a believer that the best served group to identify and ensure that that assistance is provided are the groups that deal with those individuals every day.", "12906 And rather than a blunt instrument that would require us to require more information about our customers than I believe is probably right or reasonable for them to have to supply to their telecommunications operator, that those -- that assistance should be given through the provincial or federal social assistance programs that are already available.", "12907 And should be evaluated for expansion and you should make sure broadband is included in that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the role of the telecommunications operator to source that information about individual Canadians and make decisions about which individual Canadians should or shouldn\u2019t be qualified for assistance. ", "12908 I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the role of a telecommunications operator and I think it would be extremely difficult for a telecommunications operator to get that right, in a respectful way for the people who need it. ", "12909 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. That\u2019s well put. ", "12910 But having said that, do you offer a basic package of some kind? We\u2019ve heard from different providers that will have a $9.95 package or that sort of thing. ", "12911 Do you have -- do you offer something like that to your customers?", "12912 MS. TUSK: No we have entry -- our entry level package -- the other thing that\u2019s different though about our packages, versus most of the providers you\u2019ve heard from, is that we don\u2019t have any bandwidth cap.", "12913 So we give our customers bill certainty on their bill, because we have unlimited use of internet included in all of our packages. ", "12914 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "12915 MS. TUSK: So when they choose a broadband speed and they buy that package they know that that\u2019s what their bill is going to be that month and it doesn\u2019t depend on how much they use. They have full use of the internet. ", "12916 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "12917 MEMBER VENNARD: Can you give us an idea of what your packages are, what your lowest to your highest, given that they\u2019re all unlimited data?", "12918 MS. TULK: Yeah, so the lowest package is $60, an unlimited package, if you purchase it standalone without any of our other services.", "12919 MEMBER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "12920 MS. TULK: We have also -- you can get -- depending on which other services you buy bundled discounts can apply and you can get another -- you can get up to $40 in bundle discounts depending on other services you\u2019re purchasing.", "12921 And we also have a plan that allows a customer to put internet and wireless data together -- wireless together in the same plan and be able to combine the usage that\u2019s available. So basically flat rate data on both wireless and internet devices inside the same plan. ", "12922 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Okay, thank you.", "12923 Now, going back to the idea of the -- once again back to the money and the funding and subsidies. What do you think has worked, given all the funding programs and the targeted programs and so on? From your point of view, what has seemed to work in the last -- you\u2019ve been in the business 15 years now. What has worked and what hasn\u2019t worked, from your point of view?", "12924 MS. TULK: Well, you know, I think what I\u2019ve seen works is when individual communities are actively involved in the solution. ", "12925 And so, you know, in the case of -- you know, when I look back at the brand program that was really good and that individual community participated, but as one example in that program a number of communities in the Province of New Brunswick got together and collectively looked to address the problem and collectively accessed the money and collectively set forth for the funding and drove broadband out to -- you know, was virtually universality of broadband in the province. And so I think that is a great example of communities working together to address the problem.", "12926 I think in the current Connecting Canadians program I also really like that aspect of it. I like that individual communities who know what it is they\u2019re looking for are making decisions as to how in accessing use the money to solve the problem in their individual community.", "12927 And I think that brings a commitment of the community to look at both their short and long-term needs that I would like to believe that -- I do as a business person, I would like to believe every business person does, but I think the reality is knowing that the communities are controlling their own destiny in the selections and choices they\u2019re making has a lot of power to it, and so I think that\u2019s a very good element of those programs.", "12928 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Now, what I\u2019d like to do is to move the discussion into sort of more of a general level and address some of these things that we had, you know, decided that we want to start thinking about earlier.", "12929 And here of course we\u2019re -- you know, there\u2019s the idea of the strategy, there\u2019s an idea of a broadband fund, and so on. So I\u2019d like to first of all start with the idea of should there be something that resembles a broadband fund. What do you think would be a good working model for that?", "12930 I know in your submission you talked about maybe repurposing or redirecting the existing voice fund as it naturally sort of dies off anyway.", "12931 From your point of view, what would guiding principles for a broadband fund -- what should we -- would you have recommendations for us?", "12932 MS. TULK: Well -- so, first of all, we\u2019re not in support of a broadband subsidy or a fund beyond what the federal government is doing. I think that -- and what the provincial governments are doing.", "12933 I think the reason for that is again we actually believe that the pace of rollout, although it didn\u2019t meet the 2004 aspiration, is quite stunning in its success, and we\u2019re down to very real issues in very real communities that need to get solved community-by-community piece-by-piece, and they require that individual look at the problems and issues in each and selections in each around how they can get it.", "12934 So I think the fact that the federal government is making this money available for communities to use to solve this problem I think is very compelling.", "12935 And I often find and found in the past that when you set up funding mechanisms or subsidies two things happen. One, it takes the pressure off where the policy pressure potentially should stay, and is clearly being reacted to in the federal government programs. So I wouldn\u2019t like to see the pressure taken off that continued funding into these communities to help them solve their problems.", "12936 And the other thing is it tends to set up extremely complicated and unwieldy and a lot of overhead in the administration, and debate, and re-debate about the fund. I mean, in the specific example you opened a public record to talk broadband and immediately people started filing and -- and, you know, you say we talked about voice, we\u2019ve talked about voice because we\u2019re required to react to someone else bringing into a proceeding ---", "12937 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "12938 MS. TULK: --- trying to reopen that proceeding that\u2019s been well-examined and put to bed, right.", "12939 And so this overhead really I don\u2019t think in many cases is solving the problem. What\u2019s solving the problem is making the funding available to the communities that need it, who have a legitimate concern and need, and then industry stepping up. And I think by the fact that these Connecting Canadian programs have been well competed for by multiple companies industry has shown its willingness to step up and be a partner.", "12940 So we don\u2019t see that there\u2019s something broken here, beyond the fact that as, you know, Bell pointed out I believe yesterday, this is an extremely large economic problem and the solution for it is continuing to solve the extremely large economic source of funds, and I think the government has shown itself to be at a really good pace to do that.", "12941 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Well thank you for that.", "12942 I just -- a few other things that I want to just kind of talk about with you, and what is the idea of a broadband strategy, a national broadband strategy. Do you think there should be a preferred technical solution to that? Do you think there should be like a fibre strategy, a wireless strategy, both, a combination? What are your thoughts on that?", "12943 MS. TULK: Well, if you want to get into a lot of technical detail Hong would be a better example.", "12944 But I guess just from a policy and strategic perspective I don\u2019t think -- you know, as I mentioned, I\u2019ve been in the industry a long time. I don\u2019t think there is a single technical solution that applies across all of the areas that we\u2019re talking about and the differences between, you know, urban and rural, the differences in the geography, the distance limitations, the issues in the far north. I think many different technologies need to be brought to bear in Canada to solve this problem for all Canadians. ", "12945 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. And that would include satellite, and fibre, and wireless, and the ---", "12946 MS. TULK: And, you know, like any other industry there are certain tools that are right for a certain purpose, and I think the point is to go in and apply the tool that\u2019s right for purpose to each existing -- each specific problem, which in this specific case is a community-by-community evaluation.", "12947 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So do you think mobile broadband should be part -- would that be appropriate to have that in there as well, or do you think we should be looking at more of a fixed ---", "12948 MS. TULK: I think mobile broadband can be a solution. I think it\u2019s -- the economics of it are probably still a few years away before it\u2019s a viable true solution, depending on, you know, which vendor and technology vendor you ask, you know, that time is shorter or longer, but I don\u2019t believe in most cases it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a good adjunct into coverage. ", "12949 And, as an example, the program that I talked about that we\u2019ve launched with -- we call it Total Internet -- that allows consumers to pool their wireless and their home internet into one plan is an excellent plan where there\u2019s good broadband and wireless coverage and allows that from a terms of use and utilization of the various networks. ", "12950 But in terms of going into a community that\u2019s current unserved and trying to serve it specifically with a wireless solution is in fact in most cases uneconomical at this point versus other options.", "12951 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: It seems the time has come when we are able to take a more nuanced approach to communities and their needs rather than just trying to, you know, sort of a blunt, let\u2019s try and cover the country type of ---", "12952 MS. TULK: Even in our own province the different -- you know, dealing with some of these MKO communities that we\u2019re dealing with we\u2019re having to do completely different things than we\u2019re doing -- you know, so we have areas of the province where the coverage needs are based on dispersion of the population because they\u2019re, you know, kind of evolved -- you know, they have farming areas, people live very far apart, things like that. We have other areas where the issue is the population is actually not overly dispersed but getting to the population is a massive problem.", "12953 So in those two examples groups of people equally unserved or underserved, equally frustrated, equally deserving of broadband, but the solution for them is from a technical perspective day and night, completely different and an economic perspective.", "12954 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So we\u2019ve heard many times about different unserved pockets and so on. Is that a major issue in your serving area do you think?", "12955 MS. TULK: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d classify it as a major issue. As I mentioned, we have, you know, very good coverage, but it\u2019s -- there definitely are -- I mean, the reality of the network is that with the exception of pure fibre to the premises services in the VDSL2 and ADSL solutions they are distance sensitive so they depend on loop lines. And that, by its nature, has led to some black holes of coverage. We have specifically some black holes in our case in the business market that we\u2019re aiming to address. But in general, it\u2019s -- I wouldn\u2019t call it a major problem.", "12956 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Do you think that quality of service metrics should be important in anything that we might be looking at in terms of strategy or from a regulatory point of view?", "12957 MS. TULK: I don\u2019t think as a widespread blunt instrument they\u2019re necessary because certainly, for the vast majority of Canada, it\u2019s a highly competitive market. I think what we have seen in the past useful is in the case of some of the government funding programs they\u2019ve had requirements built in that in accepting the money you must guarantee that that community has similar pricing and similar quality of service delivered over time to areas that didn\u2019t receive funding. I think that\u2019s useful as an adjudicator. But I don\u2019t think broad based quality of service is necessary. I see no evidence of a need for that across the country.", "12958 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. From your point of view, do you think that it would be -- would make sense to set basic service targets at a less than Pan-Canadian view? So different targets for different areas? What do you think on that one?", "12959 MS. TULK: Again, I think -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. If it were to move forward, I think it\u2019s reasonable insofar where government funding has been used to expand broadband. I think it\u2019s probably reasonable in that case.", "12960 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: To -- from your view that would speak to accountability to make sure that --", "12961 MS. TULK: Yeah, exactly.", "12962 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- you achieve -- yeah.", "12963 MS. TULK: Yeah.", "12964 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "12965 MS. TULK: Yeah.", "12966 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "12967 Okay. I\u2019ve got basically just two -- a couple more questions to ask you before I turn it over to my colleagues. And I\u2019m wondering if you would like to comment on a digital literacy strategy. How -- do you think something like that would be useful for us in our country and for us to think about here on the Commission? Or and what would that look like? We\u2019ve heard a lot about digital literacy as well.", "12968 MS. TULK: Well, I think -- so I guess I\u2019d say I believe digital literacy and work on digital literacy is critically important going forward. I think it\u2019s important for our country with respect to the ability of our country to continue to prosper in a knowledge economy going forward, and to be competitive both intra in the country but also on a global level. ", "12969 So I see it as a -- we would see it -- we do a lot of digital literacy, as I mentioned, with seniors, new Canadians, disability groups, et cetera. I think it\u2019s actually more of an education issue. I think it belongs -- digital literacy is an issue in the -- that should start in the primary education level, as -- by the way, you know, having been part of the Canadian Council on Learning in the past, as is other forms of literacy. And I think Canadian\u2019s ability to operate and work and prosper in the knowledge economy is something that has to be addressed. Because I believe it\u2019s an education issue I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a CRTC issue.", "12970 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "12971 MS. TULK: I have to admit, I\u2019m not an expert on the division between, you know, the federal and provincial government, but I know education is generally a provincial responsibility and -- but I do think it\u2019s something that our industry should be talking about, our industry should be calling attention to. But I wouldn\u2019t see it as something that\u2019s the CRTC\u2019s mandate to solve.", "12972 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. And the final thing I want to ask you about is accessibility and the disabled persons. Do you -- what do you have, if anything, on -- to handle people who might have different needs?", "12973 MS. TULK: We have a wide range of accessibility and I can ask Paul to add on, but accessibility programs. We do in most -- in a number of our residential or consumer product areas we offer a discount on -- to -- sorry, on our internet we offer a discount to subscribers who have forms of disability. We have an accessibility website where we provide information and tips on our -- to our customers in terms of which of our products and services may be better and may be helpful to them with respect to their specific type of disability. And that\u2019s organized by general disability category. ", "12974 And we also have set up in our retail -- one of our retail stores that we\u2019re piloting a program where we set it up as an accessibility centre of excellence. We have a number of accessibility improvements in there, including staff trained in American sign language. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve piloted with the Canadian Centre for Disabilities disability and accessibility awareness training for employees. And so far about 600 of our employees have taken that training.", "12975 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Oh. Do you have anything else to add?", "12976 MR. NORRIS: Maybe just to emphasize that we -- through our forums with the disabled peoples, we actually get their input. So we don\u2019t start off with an assumption of what we need to do. We actually gather feedback from them. We gather feedback on our products and services. We gather feedback on our sales channels in terms of, you know, for example, our portal, making sure that it is accessible, making sure that the screen readers can work properly on ours and that we\u2019re not using pdfs. Those types of things are all the kinds of things that we do.", "12977 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Well, thank you very much. Those are all of my questions.", "12978 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "12979 Commissioner Molnar?", "12980 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "12981 I want to go over the voice subsidy requirement with you, if you don\u2019t mind.", "12982 You have heard those that have suggested that it be redeployed to broadband. And I -- you state here that it continues to be important. But I wanted to give you an opportunity to address some of the sort of key arguments that have been made to either eliminate it or transfer it. ", "12983 And -- excuse me -- one of the arguments -- I\u2019ll throw out the three that I\u2019ve heard and give you a chance to give your rebuttal, if you don\u2019t mind.", "12984 One is that VoIP products provide -- will provide these customers with access to voice. Another I\u2019ve heard is that cellular is available. It\u2019s, you know, we\u2019ve got basically 20 percent of customers have already unsubscribed to basic wireline. There\u2019s cellular and other voice options available. And another that I\u2019ve heard is that the subsidy is unnecessary because the investment in the copper has already been recovered.", "12985 MS. TULK: Okay. Well, maybe we\u2019ll take those in turn and I\u2019ll give a high level and then my colleagues can go deeper on them.", "12986 With first the spec with the VoIP products. It is true that VoIP products are available. I would point out VoIP products are available where you have IP services. So until we have universal access to broadband there\u2019s not universal access to VoIP services either. So these things go hand in hand to some extent.", "12987 But also, VoIP products, you know, have nuances to them. And in many cases require, you know, different equipment than a consumer already has in the home, and different terms of use, particularly over the top voice, things like that, which are in fact quite scary still for a number of vulnerable Canadians. You and I might find them easy to use, but certainly there are many Canadians who don\u2019t. So we\u2019d be removing choice for -- and forcing change on Canadians who, you know, are in the least position potentially to be able to adapt to that change. And if you want more technical details on VoIP, Hong can certainly give that.", "12988 Respect to where cellular is available, I think the issue is an economic one as well as a usage one. There are certainly, although there\u2019s high penetration of wireless, it\u2019s not universal. And certainly the availability of wireless from a perspective to say someone\u2019s required to now subscribe to wireless who may not otherwise or, in fact, use wireless differently than from an economic perspective, the wireless plans, generally, would end up being more expensive for many Canadians. So in terms of economic access to communications, wireline is still a better solution.", "12989 And then in terms of being unnecessary, again, I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re not going to in this proceeding reopen what we just explored fully a few years ago. But I think the costs have been, you know, filed on the public record. They were relooked at again in 2011 and deemed by the CRTC to be reasonable.", "12990 And although the original capital investment in these communities has, you know, in many cases been fully depreciated. The cost of continuing to serve these communities is very high. We have fly-in communities, we have communities in the winter that require other modes of access, you know, and they\u2019re very hard to serve and difficult to serve. And you have to continue to upgrade the network. Like, you know, we replace drops all the time. And we spend a tremendous amount of money each and every year serving these networks.", "12991 Pat, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add?", "12992 MS. SOLMAN: Yeah. I just wanted to add, you know, you have incidents like -- and unfortunately last year we had two fires in two of these remote communities in the COs and we had to replace the equipment. And you can\u2019t -- because the copper is already there you\u2019ve just got to replace the electronics. And so we had to rebuild those sites. ", "12993 And the funds go to maintaining it, not just -- like, the operating costs are huge because they are remote. But there\u2019s also still capital maintenance costs that need to be incurred, regardless of the fact that the copper plant is already paid for.", "12994 MR. NORRIS: Maybe if I could just add a couple more points on it as well. You know, our view is obviously that the phone service is an essential service and that we shouldn\u2019t be looking at change there. ", "12995 I would add that there is groups of people that are more comfortable with it and they can tend to be seniors or more vulnerable groups, and so we have to kind of take that into account that there is segments that have different needs and have different expectations.", "12996 The other piece is that there is inherent reliability in the basic telephone service. The line is powered through the CO right to the end so it\u2019s not subject to power outages, those types of things, and weather and those kind of issues don\u2019t crop up as well. So, you know, something that might be more satellite fed with a VoIP solution can have some -- it doesn\u2019t necessarily have the same reliability that a traditional line does.", "12997 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thanks. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to expand on that.", "12998 And you also talk about the fact that the subsidy has declined by 35 percent and the trend is expected to continue. So how would you see this natural evolution occurring if the Commission didn\u2019t intervene?", "12999 MS. TULK: Well, it\u2019s naturally occurring to one of the points in the original question. As people naturally select alternative technologies and move, you know, and the adoption goes up -- you know, you talked about the wireless only stats, things like that -- these lines go down. And the contribution regime is designed to address that and naturally fall.", "13000 So as I mentioned, we\u2019ve seen that decline since 2010. It\u2019s moving apace. There\u2019s no slowing in that decline. We expect to see it continue. And I think the other thing that it does is it allows the receivers of the funds to evaluate and manage through how they\u2019re going to deal with the loss of those funds over time. And so I think that\u2019s a steady pace or reduction that can be maintained without putting undo pressure on the actual users. ", "13001 Any acceleration of that decline would have to be accompanied, and I think has been proposed in some of the proceeding, with an increase in the cost of basic service beyond the price cap. And we think that that would mean that these services would go quickly well beyond the point of affordability for a lot of the people who rely on them.", "13002 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. You spoke about 98 percent of households had access to fixed broadband and 95 percent at speeds from 5 to 9.9 megabits. Are you saying that 95 percent meet the CRTC\u2019s basic definition?", "13003 MS. TULK: Well, we got those statistics from the CRTC exhibits so ---", "13004 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Maybe I\u2019ll ask my question more directly. Is the upload net on that 95 percent?", "13005 MS. TULK: We don\u2019t know that. The download speeds were all that was disclosed in the statistics. I mean, we don\u2019t have -- we have access to our own information but we don\u2019t have access to the whole province\u2019s information except in so far as the TMR Report, and so that\u2019s where that information is taken from.", "13006 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, that\u2019s fair. So if we were to talk about the customers you serve, would these percentages align with the customers you serve?", "13007 MS. TULK: Well, as I mentioned, in our ADSL areas our upload speeds would go to 768.", "13008 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right, so ---", "13009 MS. TULK: (Inaudible) say 712 so ---", "13010 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I think you said 80,000 or something like that?", "13011 MS. TULK: That\u2019s right.", "13012 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Eighty-five thousand (85,000) ADSL out of 500,000 customers you serve.", "13013 MS. TULK: Out of the total households that we serve. So in the -- Hong, what would be the -- well, I guess we could take an undertaking because I don\u2019t think we have on the public record the detailed definition. But we can give you the breakdown if we haven\u2019t already between the technologies in our service area, if you like.", "13014 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Sure. Okay, thanks. Those are my questions.", "13015 ", "UNDERTAKING", "13016 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just a few more questions. ", "13017 Was the issue of broadband discussed in your recent election; do you know?", "13018 MS. TULK: Was the issue of broadband discussed in the recent election in Manitoba?", "13019 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "13020 MS. TULK: Not in a large scale way, I wouldn\u2019t say. That\u2019s of course my opinion.", "13021 THE CHAIRPERSON: Not a large scale that means not at all or hardly? We were discussing other things perhaps.", "13022 MS. TULK: Perhaps.", "13023 THE CHAIRPERSON: You\u2019re familiar with the EKOS study we conducted and put on the public record?", "13024 MS. TULK: Yes.", "13025 THE CHAIRPERSON: And perhaps I can bring you to Tables 2.12, which -- in the representative sample. I\u2019m going to focus on that one. And I\u2019ll grant you that Saskatchewan and Manitoba are bundled together. I think there\u2019s a statistical reason for that in terms of number of people. But this is a study of dissatisfaction, percentage of people surveyed that are dissatisfied. ", "13026 In terms of reliability, the national average is 16 percent being dissatisfied but in Saskatchewan and Manitoba it\u2019s 19 percent. In terms of speed, the national average is 19 for Saskatchewan and Manitoba in terms of home internet and for speed, and in that territory it\u2019s -- in those two provinces it\u2019s 23 percent. And in terms of price, well, you align with the national dissatisfaction of 48 percent.", "13027 Do you care to comment on that?", "13028 MS. TULK: Well, I\u2019m ---", "13029 THE CHAIRPERSON: Because I take it your argument is things are fine?", "13030 MS. TULK: Well, no, I wouldn\u2019t say things are fine. As I mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of things we\u2019re working on.", "13031 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "13032 MS. TULK: And one of them, which you\u2019ve probably seen even in our public disclosures, we believe we have a lot of work to do with respect to our customer experience at MTS. And we\u2019ve recently embarked, which we announced in Q3 of last year, on a three-year customer experience transformation program where we\u2019ll invest about $100 million into improving the customer experience for our subscribers. So certainly we\u2019re not ---", "13033 THE CHAIRPERSON: Sorry, just so I understand, customer ---", "13034 MS. TULK: --- happy with these numbers but we\u2019ll be ---", "13035 THE CHAIRPERSON: Customer experience, it covers reliability and speed?", "13036 MS. TULK: It covers a number of the things that we see driving the dissatisfaction of our customers. ", "13037 We also, you know, as we mentioned, we\u2019re going in very specifically into each community. We\u2019ve recently, with Pat and Hong, in the last number of months have put a lot of work into understanding the specific performance in each community that we serve with broadband and we\u2019re going in. As Hong mentioned, we have programs for the communities that are having a problem, including a few which we mentioned are in the MKO communities in particular, and doing overbuilds and improvements to the network to bring up the speed and reliability.", "13038 But that being said, I think one thing I\u2019ve mentioned about the surveys is that -- two things. When you look at, you know, obviously margin of error. As you get into the provincial breakdowns it\u2019s different than the national number. ", "13039 And the other things, as I mentioned in my submission, the unfortunate -- well, not unfortunate, it\u2019s a great province, but the reality of Manitoba is that it\u2019s a much more -- and Saskatchewan for that matter -- are much more geographically dispersed and rural provinces than some of the other, and certainly much more rural and remote than the national average.", "13040 So there are definitely -- I think it\u2019s well known and well documented on the record of this proceeding that there are unfortunately still disparities in the availability of speeds in urban centres in Canada versus some of the more rural and remote. And I think you\u2019re seeing that reflected in some of those numbers.", "13041 THE CHAIRPERSON: The dissatisfaction percentages for mobile internet in Table 2.3 also suggests the gap of the national average being for reliability 13, but in Saskatchewan and Manitoba 22. And in terms of speed, average nationally 14, but Saskatchewan and Manitoba 22. And you\u2019re about the same in terms in price as the national average.", "13042 Would your answer be the same to that?", "13043 MS. TULK: I think it would be the same as definitely the urban and rural has the same issues reflected in with respect to the wireless network as the broadband network. And also, the same evaluation that we're doing in looking at how we can improve this.", "13044 I mean, so I\u2019d say the numbers are unfortunately not surprising to me but we're very committed to improving them and we're making significant investments in our company to bringing them up in the future.", "13045 THE CHAIRPERSON: And you're doing that because of market forces?", "13046 MS. TULK: Yeah, I think market forces and also because, quite honestly, it's obviously not -- our performance isn\u2019t acceptable to a number of our customers and so whether you call that market forces or you call that just good business, we should be doing better for our customers.", "13047 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, presumably you don\u2019t want to lose those customers to other competitors.", "13048 MS. TULK: Exactly, exactly.", "13049 THE CHAIRPERSON: To the extent that there are competitors available in some of the regions.", "13050 MS. TULK: Yeah, and there's competitors available in, you know, the vast majority of our customer base and certainly we need to be competitive in order to prosper.", "13051 THE CHAIRPERSON: To your knowledge, do the current social assistance programs in Manitoba include a calculation for connectivity?", "13052 MS. TULK: Do you know?", "13053 MS. GRANDE: I\u2019m sorry, repeat.", "13054 MS. TULK: Can you repeat the question?", "13055 THE CHAIRPERSON: So there's a variety of social assistance programs presumably offered by the Government of Manitoba.", "13056 MS. GRANDE: Yes.", "13057 THE CHAIRPERSON: When those calculations occur -- and you may not have the information at hand, that's fine, but when we do -- when government programs in Manitoba try to calculate the amount of social assistance, is connectivity part of that calculation?", "13058 MS. GRANDE: So when -- if you are speaking to when people put on their application and specifically to which funds they're going to get to cover which expenses, there is a provision for a cell phone but I'm not aware of any provision for a broadband connectivity.", "13059 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "13060 MS. GRANDE: And there are conditions to my knowledge on the type of cell phone and for the purpose of the use. But I'm not aware for broadband connectivity.", "13061 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you think that's the right approach to take to social assistance programs or would your leadership be advocating that perhaps we should think about life\u2019s necessities for the low income Manitobans to include such things as connectivity?", "13062 MS. TULK: Well, I think, you know, certainly we advocate, as we mentioned, that access to broadband is important to all citizens and, you know, I think that there's various ways that communities or governments can go about providing that. And I think that there are -- you know, I guess another question in the availability of broadband that I think a lot of the provincial and municipal governments are considering is, is broadband required for each individual home or is the availability of places such as public libraries and community sites, and et cetera, to be able to use broadband a reasonable solution to the essential service.", "13063 So I think we said in our submission we believe that contributing and being part of the partnership to make broadband available to citizens is a role of all levels of government. One way might be in the social assistance calculation but there's certainly other ways that might be appropriate as well.", "13064 THE CHAIRPERSON: So when I asked you whether you've advocated for social assistance calculations to include connectivity, I guess your answer is, to your knowledge, that has not ---", "13065 MS. TULK: To my knowledge, we have not taken that on as an advocacy in our government relations program or whatever.", "13066 THE CHAIRPERSON: With respect to access to local libraries to access the internet, I don\u2019t know if you've had a chance to read the transcripts or actually watch the hearing when some very poor people came to advocate and saying that, you know, when part of their social assistance needs flow from their mobility issues -- and it snows in Manitoba, does it not?", "13067 MS. TULK: Quite a bit.", "13068 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. So is telling somebody with mobility issues to travel some distance to a local library a valid solution to connectivity?", "13069 MS. TULK: Well, I think -- so I would say in that specific example, no, but I think that, in fact, supports the argument we've made that these solutions need to be provided on a case-by-case basis by the organizations best able to know the case-by-case needs.", "13070 And so I think that it is certainly for certain people reasonable that they might be encouraged to go use a public access site. For others and individuals with accessibility, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be and, you know, that's exactly our position here.", "13071 We're not in a position to be able to adjudicate individual needs of individuals with respect to social assistance. We certainly would support that that is a role that the governments and the government bodies that are engaged with these individuals should be taking. And yes, you know, I think broadband is an important part of that discussion and should be considered in those programs.", "13072 THE CHAIRPERSON: But your company has not so far advocated anything to do with that?", "13073 MS. TULK: Again, not that I'm aware of.", "13074 THE CHAIRPERSON: Earlier you talked about the need for policy intervention and government funding. I take it that your point is that government funding should be principally, if not exclusively, federal?", "13075 MS. TULK: No. I think that there's roles for different funding. I think to date most of the funding has been provided federally.", "13076 In the past, I have actually been involved and I know MTS was as well before I was there in advocating that certain of the infrastructure, provincial infrastructure funding should be used for broadband, et cetera. So I think that there's roles for all levels of government to play.", "13077 And as I mentioned, you know, as just one example, the community access and library sites and things like that, in most cases they are provided by either provincial or municipal organizations.", "13078 THE CHAIRPERSON: But in light of your earlier response to the fact that broadband issues weren\u2019t widely discussed in your recent election, what are the likelihoods of additional funding occurring from the Manitoba coffers?", "13079 MS. TULK: I can't speak to that.", "13080 THE CHAIRPERSON: Earlier, Rogers put forward the idea of a multi stakeholder advisory council. You referred to \u201cfinishing the job\u201d, saying that we've done a long way but there may be still gaps.", "13081 What is your view on the utility of having a multi stakeholder advisory council to ensure coordination to fill the gap?", "13082 MS. TULK: Well, so I think it's a good idea. I think it needs to be set with the right parameters and I think it needs to have the right level of attention and timeline given to it.", "13083 I think if we're going to set something like that up, it should be set up for a short period of time with clear deliverables and expected to deliver on that strategy rather than be a group that has an endless date. I think you, yourself, were talking about, you know, how these things go on and they move down in levels of attention and detail until, you know, they're meeting and not actually driving change.", "13084 So I think it's important that it be set up with a firm end date and a firm set of deliverables.", "13085 THE CHAIRPERSON: So what would they be?", "13086 MS. TULK: Well, you know, I think it would be to look at the unserved areas of the country and to put together an advocacy position to go forward to the various levels of government as to how those specific unserved, you know, the last 2 percent if you will that we expect to be there after the current Connecting Canadians funding how that's going to be addressed.", "13087 THE CHAIRPERSON: Again, federal funding.", "13088 MS. TULK: No, I said the current Connecting Canadians program is federal funding.", "13089 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "13090 MS. TULK: But I think I said or at least I meant to say to put together an advocacy strategy of how the next 2 percent should be addressed. That's not to say I wouldn\u2019t preclude the work of that committee that that outcome would be necessarily federal.", "13091 THE CHAIRPERSON: But the funding would be?", "13092 MS. TULK: May not be. That will be part of what I think needs to be examined and then brought forward to varying parties.", "13093 You know, as I mentioned in my opening comments, I think there's roles of all levels of government, from band councils, municipalities, provincial governments, and the federal government to play in this and I think that, you know, quite honestly, I'm quite -- you know, provincial governments across the country have been involved. In some cases, municipalities have been involved. Band councils have been involved.", "13094 And I think kudos, the majority to date of the support has come from the federal government but I think there's roles for a lot of different levels of government to play.", "13095 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Well, in terms of timelines and remits for a potential multi stakeholder advisory council, others have agreed to give some thought to that and put it on the record.", "13096 Perhaps you can as well respond to that in the various phases coming up.", "13097 MS. TULK: For sure, yeah.", "13098 THE CHAIRPERSON: And see what\u2019s your perspective on it.", "13099 MS. TULK: Yeah, we'll do that.", "13100 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Thank you very much. Those are our questions I believe. Yes from legal.", "13101 MS. TULK: Okay. Thank you.", "13102 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for participating. I should -- actually, I will commend you for your -- the gender representation on your panel. It's ---", "13103 MS. TULK: Thank you.", "13104 THE CHAIRPERSON: One of my colleagues, Vice-Chair Menzies, pointed out that you were I believe the first province to give the vote. Now you may have gotten another success here today.", "13105 MS. TULK: Yeah. Well, Chairman, I appreciate those remarks and it is a -- I know that it's been a comment that you've been making all week, and knowing we were coming late in the week, I think it's fair to point out this has always been the panel we've had.

I\u2019ll just ask you to identify your panel so that we can have the right names associated for the transcript and you can go ahead and make your presentation when you are ready.", "13296 Thank you.", "PRESENTATION", "13297 MR. GLUSTEIN: Good day, Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commission. My name is Hyman Glustein. I\u2019m a telecommunications advisor for the Cree Nation Government.", "13298 If I can just take a moment before the introductions, at the outset of the hearing, Mr. Chairman, you set a challenge for presenters which was to demonstrate using evidence that the public interest and the specific situation of a region justify action by the CRTC.", "13299 Today we propose to explain why market forces have been and continue to be insufficient in our region and we propose to offer a solution for our region. And we thank you for that opportunity.", "13300 With me today, behind me are Louis Lavergne who is Telecommunications Planning Consultant for the Cree Nation Government, and Cedric Melan\u00e7on, the directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du R\u00e9seau de communications Eeyou, Eeyou Communications Network.", "13301 And at the end of the panel, at the far end of the panel is Fran\u00e7ois Turgeon who is a member of the Executive Committee of the ECN and a Cree School Board representative on the Board of Directors.", "13302 He\u2019s also the Director of Information Technologies and Telecommunications for the Cree School Board.", "13303 Beside me is -- well, I\u2019ll try to do this in the right order. Next to him is Bella Moses Petawabano, who is the Chairperson of the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay, and she\u2019s also the representative of the Cree Health Board on the Board of the ECN. ", "13304 Next to her is Dr. Ted Moses. Dr. Moses is the former Grand Chief of the Crees Eeyou Istchee and is also the initiator of the fibre-optic project in James Bay.", "13305 Next to him is Alfred Loon. Alfred Loon is the President of ECN and has been an Economic Development Director for the Cree Nation government over a long period of time.", "13306 And with that I\u2019ll pass the microphone over to Dr. Moses.", "13307 MR. MOSES: Thank you, Hyman.", "13308 Greetings et bonjour. It\u2019s a real pleasure for me to appear before you.", "13309 And at this time we would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on our neighbours\u2019 traditional territory, the Algonquins.", "13310 The Commission began these hearings with questions. In our replies we proposed the recommendations on how to eliminate the digital divide. Rather than repeat all those documents, I will summarize our position briefly -- very briefly. Provide all Canadians quality broadband at a fair price; provide all Canadians the same basic services. This approach worked with plain old telephones and it will work in broadband.", "13311 The benefits of making broadband a basic service for all Canadians will be felt across the spectrum. It will change the way we see ourselves and it will change the way we do what needs to be done.", "13312 By making broadband a universal service it will help eliminate the healthcare deficit. It will help eliminate the education deficit. It will encourage Canadian innovation. It will advance literacy, travel, and enterprise. It will ensure that all Canadians north and south have a greater opportunity to be part of social governance.", "13313 When it comes to remote and rural communities, as Bell says in our area \u201cWhy bother, there\u2019s no business case for expanding networks.\u201d Our approach is far more positive. The capability to interact socially, whether it\u2019s for health, education, or telecommunications, is worth more than a simple bottom-line business case, the social economy is as important for the life of a community as quarterly returns for the telcos.", "13314 For us, the bottom line includes both long-term benefits and security. And what are these long-term benefits? To be simple and straightforward, ask if without an adequate telecommunication services do more high school students graduate? Does the community and its services grow? Are communities healthier? Are there jobs for every person who wants one? Economic development and social advancement go hand-in-hand and create a balance.", "13315 Government intervention in economic development should not penalize communities that need it. If a subsidy program were adopted for remote areas the dividends should benefit everyone, not just the shareholders of telcos.", "13316 If a case can be made for a government grant it should be recognized and built upon not battered by a telecom company whose only aim is to focus your subsidies on its quarterly bottom line.", "13317 Back in the late 1990s, when the Cree Nation became aware that there were fibres crossing Eeyou Istchee it took on the challenge. And during my tenures as Grand Chief of the Crees and the Cree Nation, I set up a telecommunication committee that became the Eeyou Communications Network or ECN as its acronym.", "13318 Back then we devised a simple business plan. We determined that the biggest telecom uses were the Cree School Board and the Cree Health Board, at what rate their annual budgetary increase would be, our likely start-up date, and then we promised those agencies a deal. ", "13319 If they signed on and transferred their existing budgets we would deliver at least 20 times the bandwidth they were receiving at the same price. And instead of high cost, low quality, slow speed and limited bandwidth internet they could have enough bandwidth, virtually unlimited, to provide telemedicine, distance education, and whatever connectivity they needed. And to ensure that we would keep our word they would have a seat on the board of directors of ECN. They agreed and we delivered.", "13320 It took a while to overcome the opposition from sceptical provincial and federal government agencies, but in the end they understood that we were proposing to use existing budgets not ask for additional money and that any new investment they chose to make in the network would mean long-term savings for them. In effect, every dollar would be repaid repeatedly in cost savings, and it was.", "13321 Together with our partners, including the five non-Aboriginal towns in the James Bay area, we knew we could provide world class telecom service. And now with the CRTC considering including internet as a basic service with a possibility of a consumer subsidy to make the service affordable, ECN is now ready to roll out its plan to provide a real high speed internet service for the region and all of our residents.", "13322 Today ECN is more than a First Nation non-profit telecom. It serves a distinct -- it serves two distinct cultures, 14 communities with a population of 30,000 working hard on development issues and hundreds if not thousands of different types of businesses and services, all of them with a need for access to the world.", "13323 If ECN were to receive a subsidy the only beneficiaries would be its consumers. We are not asking for special treatment or for exceptional rules. We are asking for equal treatment and equal services. We are asking for a level playing field so that people in our communities can do the best they can without obstacles and without hindrance. We all need the same services and we all need to be treated fairly.", "13324 Society needs modern communication tools to prosper and to survive. This is a positive role for government to step in and say it must happen. And when telco say there\u2019s no business case the government should be open to encouraging those who can do it by finding other solutions. We have those solutions and with your support they can be implemented and everyone will benefit from your determination.", "13325 Thank you.", "13326 MS. PETAWABANO: (Speaking in native language) bonjour, hello, Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, CRTC staff. ", "13327 Let me start by saying that I am here today in many roles, among others, as a Member of the Board of ECN and as a resident of an underserved community.", "13328 I am a Northern telecom consumer, a resident of Mistissini, a Telebec consumer for many years. I work with the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay, which means I need to travel across our region and elsewhere frequently. I\u2019m away too often and I don\u2019t have a landline at home. ", "13329 We hold our traditional feast and family gatherings in Mistissini. That\u2019s where the roots of my family is. Since the internet there is limited by unreliable speed and dropped connections my children and grandchildren, some of whom are in schools and universities in Montreal, Gatineau, often find these prolonged visits interfere with their studies and their friendships, like all young people. They need access to modern internet telecommunications.", "13330 As you already know, Telebec Bell currently has an embargo on new DSL installations in most Cree communities. Recently I contacted other suppliers, including Xplornet, who said they have no service to Mistissini, a \u201cstop sell\u201d they call it, until they have space available, which could take a few months to a year.", "13331 I spoke to Bell, but since I have no land phone, although my house is already wired, notwithstanding the embargo, they would not provide a flat-rate DSL service. Instead, they offered a turbo stick or a turbo hub. Cellular internet, it seems, has no embargo but also has no guarantee of data speed. ", "13332 My point is this: if Bell is a world-class company that claims the internet is provided everywhere, and if TELUS argues that we do not need to regulate how they deliver internet or to review the quality of services that internet providers offer, how do we ensure that service is available, honest, and reliable, and how do we ensure that it is affordable? ", "13333 I have worked in the Cree Board of Health and Social Services for most of my adult life and I know how important the internet is in the delivery of these services. My community deserves to be more than in a line entry on the phone economy books. It is the social fabric of our lives. If our young people have to leave in order to lead their lives, if they cannot conduct what today are considered basic skills to work, it is our loss.", "13334 Were the Commission to make internet a basic service for consumers and subsidize its transport and its delivery, there would mean more jobs and the local economy would benefit. But before ECN builds its own home delivery system, if Bell were to use ECN for its provider so it can attach its own network to deliver internet services to homes, Bell could lift its DSL embargo and provide the services it already advertises in the phone directory as more -- as now available. ", "13335 For now, we will remain outside the circle, or as they say in the telecom language, \"beyond the Cloud\". That's what my experience as a consumer of telecom services is, and to me, that's just one example of what the digital divide means to us. Thank you.", "13336 MR. LOON: Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Commissioners. I guess I'll begin by what ECN is not. We did not come about because of government grants or government programs, nor did we -- nor did benefit from past federal government broadband programs or funds. It's not -- we're not a profit-making company and we do not charge for internet service if you live in a distance or isolated area far from our central. ECN is a product of initiative by the Cree Nation Government. We are an independent, not-profit telecom network that serves the Cree communities of Eeyou Istchee and non-Aboriginal James Bay town, the area towns with fibre optic broadband link internet. ", "13337 Whatever government money we received were from funds available to all communities and telecoms. Bell claims that subsidies should not be awarded to networks that have benefit from government funds. We find this position to be disingenuous, disrespectful to all First Nation communities, which after all, have no tax base, and deceitful, as they have, on many occasions, accepted these funds, yet argue they still qualify for subsidies. ", "13338 Basic service are intended to ensure the goals set out in the Telecommunication Act of Canada are delivered, including the social objectives in 6 and 7. The major telecom may say that there is no business case for them to deliver a quality broadband service in some high cost serving areas, but for us, this is a solid business case. ", "13339 Our business case is based on the social economy of our region. ECN profitability is not only measured by our bottom line, but also by how many economic opportunities we create and how many skills we advance. We work with health and education agencies to provide facilities for social advancement and for community betterment. We make jobs, we promote capability. ", "13340 If you contrast ECN equal access pricing, charging all communities the same price with a local (inaudible) policy of charging different rates depending on distance from Val-d'Or or it's user size, it is clear how the ECN policy is intending to break down the digital divide between northern and southern communities in our region. ", "13341 We propose that this Commission reset telecommunications policies to meet community needs as it says in 7 of the Telecommunications Act, part H, to respond to the economic and social requirements of users of telecommunications services. We support the ideas as put forward by Affordable Access Coalition. Cost of delivery in the north is a major factor in pricing services and it is important that our residents are not punished for living in outlying areas. ", "13342 The ACC proposal for build outs in unserved or underserved areas deserves attention and thus the need for consumers to be subsidized. For any subsidized to be fair, transport and local distribution costs should be examined and subsidies should be determined separately, perhaps even a mix and match approach, where there are better quality transport networks available, like in our region. Most of all, the subsidies should ensure that a consumer pay a fair rate for service and the quality of service should be comparable to urban areas. ", "13343 Eeyou Communications Network is expanding into a direct consumer connectivity by as early as maybe 2018 for a range of telecommunications products. We have already built, in all of our 14 communities, a local fibre loop and a point of presence. ECN is a network with a social purpose. Our mission is to serve by providing high capacity telecom and we have the capability to bring. ", "13344 Merci. Thank you. ", "13345 MR. TURGEON: Hello. My name is Fran\u00e7ois Turgeon. I'm Director of IT at the Cree School Board, and on behalf of my employer and on behalf of the students we support, we believe that CRTC needs to obligate broadband technology as a basic service for all homes in the James Bay Eeyou Istchee territory. ", "13346 Please consider this: Eeyou Istchee is situated far from higher learning centres, colleges, and universities, and the Cree School Board and McGill University organized the delivery of distance education courses in business administration to the population. But except for Chisasibi and Wemindji, where internet is provided by local cable companies using ECN, Crees cannot access the course in over DSL internet. The reason is that Telebec DSL service is unreliable or simply not available at all. Distance learning for our students is difficult or even not possible when connectivity to internet is not available. ", "13347 A solution would be to make quality internet service universal and affordable to everyone in the northern communities. Big telcos may object and claim there are overriding issues, including costs, and digital literacy problems. ", "13348 Let's consider the cost issue. In Eeyou Istchee, Telebec will not install new DSL customers because there is an embargo in all communities from the local telco, which is Telebec. This makes it harder or difficult to attract talented teachers and even retain them. ", "13349 For students, now that the schools with ECN service have made the internet an integral part of the learning experience, what happens when the students go home? There is no equivalent service to access homework through internet or to complete their assignments electronically. Online tutoring is also not available either because there is no internet access offered at the home. ", "13350 Web portal services to parents and students to follow and monitor the progress of the children is also difficult to implement when internet is, again, not available. ", "13351 For families, who are fortunate enough to be in a service zone but have limited funds, cost becomes a key factor and as a result, it determines your side of the divide. Affordability in high class service areas needs to be addressed with a mandated basic internet services package that is clearly priced with no less than 5 megabytes bandwidth download. When students are present in the home there could be a discounted rate to this home to help the low-income houses, which is the low-income families right now is at 25 percent in the Cree communities in northern Quebec.", "13352 Then there is the issue of digital literacy. The telcos ask, \u201cWhy invest in internet when there\u2019s a low rate of digital literacy?\u201d The answer is not in deregulation but in education. After all, you have to be literate to be digitally literate.", "13353 Technology, including internet service, are tools to teach our students. In 2016 our population needs these tools to improve success for our students by improving literacy and at the same time digital literacy. According to the Canadian Literacy and Learning Network, spending on literacy has successful 241 percent return rate on investment. But even with such a significant return, does this interest the industry? ", "13354 The solution to low digital literacy is not denying internet service. It is with public education such as the courses that ECN provided for community residents for the last 10 years. A list of our training and literacy courses was filed in response to our CTRC interrogatory. ", "13355 Have any telcos offer a similar comprehensive selection of courses in technology and provided it without charge to its consumers? Finally, we can eliminate the frustration that comes when the computer doesn\u2019t do what we need it to do by assuring that the cause is not poor internet service. ", "13356 In conclusion, as Lord Kelvin said, \u201cif you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.\u201d Thank you.", "13357 THE CHAIRPERSON: Someone else also said that what gets measured gets done, so same spirit. ", "13358 Thank you for that. I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner Vennard as a first round of questions.", "13359 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Good morning. Thank you for coming to talk to us today. ", "13360 There\u2019s a number of areas that I\u2019d like to discuss with you, and these include I\u2019d like to know a little bit more about the background and how you achieved the success that you have achieved so far. And then I\u2019d like to focus on your solution and where you plan on going next.", "13361 So while we hear a lot about the challengers and the barriers that Canadians are facing we\u2019re very interested in success stories too, and obviously you have a success story to tell us about your journey so far. ", "13362 So perhaps this question could probably be -- should probably be directed at Dr. Moses since you are the founder of the ECN network and it went all the way back to the late 1990s. And so obviously you were a little ahead of your time in your thinking at that time. ", "13363 So could you tell me, tell us, what happened? Did you discover fibre somewhere or what happened because the internet, you know, wasn\u2019t really that big a deal at that time.", "13364 MR. MOSES: Thank you. I\u2019ll attempt to answer the question, and maybe I\u2019ll ask for some help from my colleagues here.", "13365 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure.", "13366 MR. MOSES: I discovered fibre optic without knowing it. When I was a Grand Chief, as a part of my duties I traveled extensively and I traveled a lot with my family, driving up to Eastmain several hundred kilometres away. And on the way I crisscrossed the high-tension 750 KV lines with a line going on top. ", "13367 It always intrigued me what was that line for? It was not a line to transport 750,000 volts of electricity. Then one day someone explained it to me that it\u2019s a fibre optic line. That it is used by Hydro-Quebec in the operation of their power generating stations in the different places in James Bay.", "13368 Then it dawned to me that having fibre optic could mean a big advancement for the Cree Nation. We have been administering our communities since 1975 after we signed the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement with the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, Hydro-Quebec, SEBJ. And more and more we have to deliver services to our members. ", "13369 So there was no internet services, I guess, in 1975. Telephone was by radio. Telephone -- there were no telephone lines into the houses. You had to go to a shack that Telbec built where you could place your call, and your call was dispatched to Alma who connected you to the number that you were calling. That was the extent of the services.", "13370 The year 2002 we entered into a -- we were entered into a new paradigm with the Government of Quebec. We signed the La Paix des Braves Agreement, which basically meant that we were renewing our relationship, one which where the Crees would embrace development in the north, where they could be partners in development.", "13371 And the result was then the Agreement of La Paix des Braves. The Agreement starts off as being, you know, on an equal footing with the Government of Quebec nation-to-nation, government to government. That was the principle under which the negotiations were conducted. ", "13372 And recently we have a special legislation that recognizes the Cree Nation Government for the Cree territory, as well as a joint management of the territory with our neighbouring communities. So we have Cree and non-Cree that are working together. It\u2019s one of the few places, I guess, in Canada where a partnership really works with the Crees and the governments. And businesses are working in partnership and everyone is working towards the same costs.", "13373 Since that relationship was starting off very well with Quebec and Hydro-Quebec -- as you know, Hydro-Quebec is owned by the Government of Quebec -- I approached the president of Hydro-Quebec and asked him, you know, what were the possibility of getting a few strands of fibre optic that could be made available to the Cree Nation for the Cree Nation to use through some kind of a company that we would -- telecommunications company that we would put together.", "13374 And after some discussion we were able to come to an understanding and agreement that would allow the Cree Nation to have access to maybe three strands of fibre, five for future all together. ", "13375 It never happened in the history of Hydro-Quebec or in the history of fibre optic in Quebec that anyone has been able to successfully conclude an agreement with Hydro-Quebec over the use of the fibre optic network. And that\u2019s how it started.", "13376 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: I suspected there was an interesting story of some kind when I was reading your submission, which is why I was asking you to expand on it.", "13377 MR. MOSES: So that\u2019s how we started. We worked with Hydro-Quebec. First starting off I set up a community; I was the Grand Chief at the time. And then, you know, we worked hard, everyone worked hard. It\u2019s amazing how partnerships can come about when they do come about when you work towards the same costs. You know, everybody puts in their effort to ensure that things work, that there is a positive result that benefits both parties. ", "13378 And since that time then the discussions with the federal, as I mentioned, the Quebec Government were funding, our potential partners, the Cree School Board, the Cree Board of Health and Social Services, the Cree communities, and ECN. And now here we are today.", "13379 I don\u2019t know if you want to hear more of the other stuff that happened?", "13380 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So just to make sure that I\u2019m on the right page here with your history. So you were able to put together a partnership that worked really really well and utilize infrastructure that was already in place?", "13381 MR. MOSES: Yes.", "13382 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Where did you get the expertise to -- who had the expertise to take it out to the -- I see there\u2019s another interesting story there from that smile.", "13383 MR. MOSES: I\u2019m going to let the President of ECN answer that one.", "13384 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "13385 MR. LOON: Thank you. When Mr. Moses was Grand Chief I was his (inaudible) officer. And when I was summoned to his office and he said, you know, what he wanted to have it done so I had to ensure that I had, you know, I had to be successful. We had to have success in doing it. ", "13386 So and at that time I had -- I was in economic development. I had no knowledge in telecommunications so I didn\u2019t know anything about, you know, telecommunications. It was just, like, \u201cpff.\u201d ", "13387 So the first thing I did was, yeah, we assembled a team and a team together. And that was -- we approached the Cree School Board. At the end of the table Mr. Turgeon, he was also the director of IT for the School Board. Then we did the same thing for the Health Board. Then one of the things we hired was an engineer to give us a hand on the -- when we set up the committee.", "13388 Then also we -- I asked -- I hired somebody that -- who will give me the everyday language what telecommunication means. That\u2019s how we started this committee together.", "13389 And this was mainly for -- what I had in mind was just I wanted to -- because I was working with the Economic Development Officer from -- for local communities. What I want them to do was just to access Internet for their own research, for their own work. And from that it expanded to health, education and it just -- it keeped [sic] on growing. So that\u2019s how we started up at the beginning.", "13390 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. That\u2019s a really interesting story. Thank you for sharing it with us.", "13391 So by using the existing infrastructure you -- it sounds like you focused on two different areas, health and education, as the primary places to start.", "13392 MR. TOON: Yes. As you know, the -- one of the three biggest employers in the region was the -- well, government, my local government and regional government, health and education. So it was -- for us it made sense to approach these entities first. And that\u2019s how we built the whole network. ", "13393 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. And ---", "13394 MR. TOON: And they had -- sorry. Like the Health Board had their own expertise in their own departments, organizations, so as the Health Board.", "13395 COMMISSIONSER VENNARD: So the funding for this project came from your partners and the partners that knew that they would benefit from it or -- and you delivered on that. Do you have a -- sort of a -- do you have an estimate of roughly how much that might have cost in terms of -- I don\u2019t know what even here dollars to try and put on that one. But I\u2019m just wondering about the magnitude of it.", "13396 MR. GLUSTEIN: Okay. Just if I could answer the regional -- the first part of the network, the phase one, was about $29 million.", "13397 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "13398 MR. GLUSTEIN: And the $29 million was made up of money from the Grand Council, which provided a third of the money. And in addition, the -- some of the money came from Quebec from the Village branch\u00e9 program to connect school boards and municipalities. And a portion of the money came from federal economic development money, which was courted on a regional basis in the North. The money could have been used elsewhere, but the Grand Council decided in its wisdom to use the money for the network.", "13399 The Grand Council has jurisdiction over economic development in the region --", "13400 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Right.", "13401 MR. GLUSTEIN: -- and decides what -- where the money\u2019s going.", "13402 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So you\u2019re a not-for-profit. So -- and at this time you connect businesses and government institutions? Is that ---", "13403 MR. GLUSTEIN: While we appreciate your comments at the outset that this is a success story -- ", "13404 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "13405 MR. GLUSTEIN: -- we don\u2019t really see it as -- we see it as an incomplete story.", "13406 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "13407 MR. GLUSTEIN: Because although we\u2019ve been able to connect the major institutions in the community and deliver very important services in the community, we haven\u2019t been able to connect users. We haven\u2019t been able to connect households.", "13408 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "13409 MR. GLUSTEIN: We\u2019re not able to provide -- although we have the capability, we have the capacity and we have the network, we also don\u2019t have local distribution networks that actually go to the homes.", "13410 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. And of course, I\u2019d like to just put that aside for the moment.", "13411 MR. GLUSTEIN: Yeah, okay.", "13412 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Because right now I just want ---", "13413 MR. GLUSTEIN: Okay. I just wanted ---", "13414 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "13415 MR. GLUSTEIN: A bit of modesty here.", "13416 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. You know, I got that part.", "13417 So this sounds like it was really quite a large undertaking when it comes right down to it. How many people did you have working on it and what was your timeframe for it and so on?", "13418 MR. GLUSTEIN: We -- there were about five of us working, three of whom actually knew how telecom worked, and Alfred and myself, who observed from a distance.", "13419 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "13420 MR. GLUSTEIN: No, seriously, there were five people working fulltime. The risk money for the project was entirely paid by the Grand Council --", "13421 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "13422 MR. GLUSTEIN: -- who we don\u2019t -- it was over a period of eight years probably. It was a substantial amount of money.", "13423 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "13424 MR. GLUSTEIN: But the Council paid it. That was in addition to the portion of the money they used for paying for the network.", "13425 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So the operating costs of the network and so on, how does that work now? What sort of arrangements do you have with Hydro-Quebec at this time?", "13426 MR. GLUSTEIN: You mean for how the network actually charges --", "13427 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "13428 MR. GLUSTEIN: -- users?", "13429 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, I\u2019m wondering about, you know, what\u2019s out there working right now. I\u2019m just wondering about the -- how that\u2019s all organized.", "13430 MR. GLUSTEIN: I\u2019ll ask Cedric Melan\u00e7on to ---", "13431 M. MELAN\u00c7ON: Yeah. Bonjour.

You\u2019re non-profit, it ---", "13453 M. MELAN\u00c7ON: Exactly. And as you know, the business case for telecommunications in the remote areas is more difficult. We understand that, for example, delivery of services to the residences is an important part in managing our network on the long term.

My colleagues may have some different questions for you on -- with respect to the history and I\u2019ll leave that for them to ask if there are any.", "13457 So you have now a plan. You have a solution for the plan and you have developed the way forward in the next part in your story. And it sounds like part of that plan is to complete the network, as you indicated in your drawings. Do you have a timeframe on when that is going to be finished?", "13458 MR. LOON: I imagine you\u2019re referring to the consumers, the residents?", "13459 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: No, the -- just to -- just the transport part of it.", "13460 MR. LOON: Okay. ", "13461 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "13462 MR. LOON: Yes, the -- well, the -- as you know, the ECN is divided into two phases. We did the first phase about four years ago. And now we\u2019re going to be completing our phase two this summer. And ---", "13463 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: This summer?", "13464 MR. LOON: This summer, yeah.", "13465 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "13466 MR. LOON: And that will be the whole -- complete the whole ECN project as was intended.", "13467 However, we -- however, there\u2019s only one community that we still have to connect that is the furthest north is in the (inaudible).", "13468 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, I saw that, yeah. ", "13469 MR. LOON: Yeah, and that's the -- that's a very challenging part of to connect. And on that part there, the Quebec government, under the Plan Nord is involved, so we're going to be working with the Quebec government in trying to find the solution to connect the (inaudible), that community. ", "13470 COMMISIONNER VENNARD: Okay. ", "13471 MR. LOON: And for future plans, when it comes to the residents, we have --- ", "13472 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Now, that's the really interesting part that I think I'd like to turn to now, is that -- and I can see that you're excited to talk about that too, so let's go.", "13473 MR. LOON: Okay, and the -- well, after we do phase two and the next project is the consumers, and we develop the -- a solution, and that is the fibre to the home and offering triple play, to -- not only to be into our Cree communities, but also the whole region, municipalities or anybody that doesn\u2019t lives within the ECN area will be -- we'll have -- make every attempt to connect.", "13474 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Now, do you have some dark fibre or are you going to use the same fibre that you're already using and extend that fibre out to the home? ", "13475 MR. LOON: Well, we do have some local groups, but we're going to need other fibre to connect to the actual residents. ", "13476 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So you're going to have some -- you're going to -- you're looking at installation of fibre too, not using existing fibre that's there, although do you have some in place already or rights to use some?", "13477 MR. LOON: The -- to the homes?", "13478 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Not to the home, to the backbone. ", "13479 MR. LOON: Oh, yes.", "13480 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. ", "13481 MR. LOON: Yes, we do have a -- like, backbone. Well, we do have a -- the -- actually, we have connected the communities to health and education and all that, and yes, we're going to use that, part of that, as a transport for (inaudible) to connect to the homes. ", "13482 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. So now you're just talking about taking it right from the backbone and into the home --- ", "13483 MR. LOON: Well, exactly. ", "13484 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- is what that phase of your project is?", "13485 MR. LOON: Exactly, from our -- what do you call -- pops, from point of presence in each community. ", "13486 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure. ", "13487 MR. LOON: From there, we will connect to the homes. ", "13488 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so tell us about your plans for that. Where are you in that?", "13489 MR. LOON: Well, right now we're at the beginning of the -- well, at the planning stages. And what we had done was we -- well, first of all, I had to learn what is fibre at home, so I -- we visited a (inaudible) lab here in Ottawa region and they showed us how it worked. And after that, what we did was we -- there was a study, a feasibility study done to find out that how much would it cost and how much, you know, and what we can deliver.", "13490 And from that, we did a tour to all communities, to all the Chief and councils, and -- to see if they would accept this project. And we did get good reception from the Chief and council. And also we did the municipalities. ", "13491 And from that what we'll do is we'll set up a -- what do you call it -- a steering committee and that will determine how we're going to structure and how we're going to operate it and everything from the ownership and also how we're going to finance the project itself. ", "13492 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So have you set up your steering committee already or is that happening (inaudible)?", "13493 MR. LOON: It's -- we set up our steering committee already and we had our first meeting in March. And it went really well, and right now we're just -- we asked them a few questions and to -- about the project and how they see it. ", "13494 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. So you're just basically fact-finding right now and putting together a plan for doing this? You know your direction but you don\u2019t have your plan for that?", "13495 MR. LOON: Yes, we're -- yeah, like I say, yeah, we're in the planning stages and ---", "13496 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "13497 MR. LOON: And --- ", "13498 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. Do you have any numbers around that, any guesses? ", "13499 MR. LOON: Well, the project itself, connecting about over 9,000 residents, and also we will connect the small enterprises, small businesses. And just on homes, there's a little over 9,000 and with about 13 communities, we estimated the project was about 20, 20 million.", "13500 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, are you thinking of having the same model where the -- it'll be a non-profit, it will sort of finance itself, and -- or are you thinking of profit at this point? ", "13501 MR. LOON: Well, that will be up to the -- better go out to the steering community to decide how they're going to structure. But I guess that's how we see it, it will be more for the -- more for little profit, that type enterprise. ", "13502 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Right, okay. Now, what's your solution and it -- you do agree with the Affordable Access Coalition ideas the other day, that they put forward the other day --- ", "13503 MR. LOON: M'hm. ", "13504 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- which is that you're thinking that you would like to have a subsidy of some kind for the transport and also for the distribution part of the network; is that correct?", "13505 MR. GLUSTEIN: Yeah, just to be clear, now, we support the notion of a -- of the build out subsidies and of their approach to it. We're not -- we don\u2019t foresee asking for money for a build out subsidy. We --- ", "13506 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Oh, I thought I saw that. Okay. ", "13507 MR. GLUSTEIN: The only place we would be -- might be -- we\u2019re a little concerned about, which is the price of the drops from the local network once we build the local network. That part is not -- would not be of concern to our subsidy, but for the drops to the homes from the network, the -- what do you call it -- the ONT? Yeah. Those things are -- they're expensive. We estimated something in the vicinity of $300 per home. ", "13508 So -- and from that side, because that cost is usually borne by the consumer, but we would seriously consider that there might be some, you know, requirement there to ask for some sort of funding. But no, not for the building itself. No, we fully support the notion that there should be a build out subsidy, but that money should be used in communities that actually need the local network. But that's not our -- we're not here asking for that money. ", "13509 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: No, so you're not looking for any sort of build out --- ", "13510 MR. GLUSTEIN: No. The only -- like I say, the only place is possibly on -- from the consumer end, in terms of installation. The idea of asking somebody to pay $300 for a drop seems somewhat exorbitant, although I paid $150 in my house, but I didn\u2019t pay 300. ", "13511 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, okay. So then when it comes to the -- a subsidy to pay for it, the affordability question, so once it gets out there, assuming it gets out there, and then how are people going to pay for this, because you've asked for two different levels of subsidies. Maybe you can just sort of expand on what your thinking was with that.", "13512 MR. GLUSTEIN: Okay, the function -- to us, the function of a subsidy is to provide money for consumers so they can afford the services. That's the sort of bottom line of what the subsidy is for. We foresee possibly at the moment looking at a business rate that it -- the subscription rate might be possibly around $55 or $60 per household. We would imagine that an affordable rate for internet service, for basic internet service, or you know, a minimum plan, would -- should probably be closer to $30. So from that side, we believe the consumers, you know, should be, you know, they should pay the same rates as they pay in major urban centres, put it that way. ", "13513 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "13514 MR. GLUSTEIN: And I think that's a consideration, so you know, the answers, the figures we're looking at are, you know, probably, you know, closer to 30 but it's not deliverable at that rate.", "13515 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. So where would you see this coming from? How would you see this -- a subsidy working for this?", "13516 MR. GLUSTEIN: Well, we think that the funding should come about the same way that the fund for telephone service is set up, that people -- that the major users contribute to the fund, the major providers contribute to the fund, the same way it is with the telephone fund, and that the money be distributed to consumers. We're not -- we understand that the issue is the -- we're not asking the CRTC to mail a cheque to every individual user, but as a -- perhaps as a -- I don't know how the CRTC would structure it, whether it would be a negative licence fee or it would be a, you know --- ", "13517 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, that's what I'm --- ", "13518 MR. GLUSTEIN: --- a subsidy fee. I'm not --- ", "13519 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- wondering, because it's -- you're --- ", "13520 MR. GLUSTEIN: --- really familiar with how the CRTC operates on (inaudible).", "13521 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, I'm just trying to get some information here because on how you see this thing working, because you are non-profit and you will be basically funding yourself and so on and so forth. And yet, the idea of a user subsidy comes into it and so I\u2019m looking at trying to understand how that fits into this picture that you\u2019re talking about.", "13522 MR. GLUSTEIN: Well, you know, as it stands right now, you know, if an organization declares its users -- has a list of subscribers, I mean, I think that\u2019s -- it\u2019s easy to calculate how, you know, what the rate of -- if we know what the -- and we know what affordable rate is. If the CRTC agrees on what an affordable rate is we -- you know, unlike a profit-making telco which does its business line forward, which is to determine, you know, how much money they can make. You know, we do our business line backwards virtually.", "13523 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. ", "13524 MR. GLUSTEIN: Because the idea is to arrive at a zero level at the end of the year. So the users get charged in relation to what the costs are. When we know what the costs are then we know, you know, what the user pays. We don\u2019t make a profit and we don\u2019t lose money. ", "13525 I mean, we\u2019re -- you know, it doesn\u2019t -- I mean, the benefits that we see as a business relate to, you know, the success in the community. I mean, if more people use the service, if more businesses use the service, well, then we have more revenue and we have more users and so it costs less for people to use the service.", "13526 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going down this path of talking about this because it seems to be -- I wasn\u2019t clearly -- it\u2019s not clear to me how you actually see that working. I mean, it\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re a for-profit and then there\u2019s a subsidy. But I\u2019m not sure how you saw this working because, you know, you\u2019re the one who brought up the idea of a subsidy for the ---", "13527 MR. GLUSTEIN: Yeah. Well, to my mind it works -- I mean, the ECN is registered as a non-dominant carrier and it would be registered as a provider once it is a provider, and it would do the same. It would be the same thing. It would be treated just the same as any other telecom.", "13528 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So what sort of a fund do you see? Do you see it being like the National Contribution Fund? Or do you see repurposing that fund, or the development of a new fund? What are your thoughts on that?", "13529 MR. GLUSTEIN: We\u2019re not opposed to the National Contribution Fund. We\u2019re not asking that it be dismantled. We support the idea that telephone companies, you know, contribute to this fund so that telephones are affordable.", "13530 All we\u2019re asking for is the same treatment on internet side.", "13531 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, because you had a lot of detail in here on how you saw a subsidy working. For example, you suggested that the subsidy should be for portable, for instance. So you must have some idea or some plan for how that would work.", "13532 MR. GLUSTEIN: I would suggest that it would be modeled the same way that the National Contribution Fund is set up. I mean, I don\u2019t see why. As a non-profit, I mean, it\u2019s a business nonetheless. I mean, just because it doesn\u2019t pay dividends to shareholders it\u2019s no less a business than any other business. ", "13533 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. It seems like the idea -- it was one of your recommendations, you know, the portability. But yet, I\u2019m still not really clear on how that fund would -- where it would come from, where it would go to, how it would be administered, and what the conditions would be, who the decision makers would be? It\u2019s not clear to me from your recommendations where you\u2019re coming from on that.", "13534 MR. GLUSTEIN: Well, as I said, the model we used was the National Contribution Fund and we were just drawing a parallel between, you know, the two subsidies. I mean, there is the subsidy now on telephone service and we were proposing that it be the same. There were various models that were proposed for how this subsidy regime would operate from various other intervenors. ", "13535 It was, you know, from First Mile or from the AAC and, you know, we -- you know, we\u2019re not -- to make it clear, we\u2019re not -- you know, we don\u2019t come here as some sort of -- we have no prior knowledge of the regulatory regime and how it operates. We take a model like telephone service and we\u2019re applying it to internet service.", "13536 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm. ", "13537 MR. GLUSTEIN: And I wish I could give you more detail on how, you know, how we would apply one to the other except I\u2019m not really familiar with sort of internally in the CRTC of how these things, you know, operate. I understand they do operate and I understand what they do, and we\u2019re just simply, you know, identifying something and saying that this is a good model.", "13538 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Well, yeah, that\u2019s fair enough. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m going down your recommendations and looking at your submission and, you know, in some places you mention things that are really very, very big and it only takes a couple of lines. And I\u2019m just wondering if you wanted to expand on any of those. ", "13539 If you haven\u2019t really thought about it that\u2019s fine; it\u2019s just an opportunity for you to say what you think about these things that you brought up if you want to. If you haven\u2019t got that far in the thinking that\u2019s fine too. I know you\u2019re early in the project. So that\u2019s also fine too.", "13540 Perhaps some of my colleagues have a question or two on that as well. ", "13541 You also mention in your recommendations about renewal subsidies so somebody has done a little bit of thinking on the whole question of the subsidies, portable, renewable. But it seems like that may be is you\u2019re still in the thinking stages as well.", "13542 You also mention in your recommendation about high-cost subsidy zones. Would you care to comment on that or is that still part of your thinking stages?", "13543 MR. GLUSTEIN: Yeah. Our point is that the high-cost subsidy zones seem to follow the architecture of the telcos.", "13544 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Right.", "13545 MR. GLUSTEIN: Which is the farther you go along the line the greater the subsidy gets. We think that if there\u2019s ever ways of delivering a service to the community that the costs not necessarily be apportioned the same way. ", "13546 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good model. I think that perhaps the model applies to telephone service, to wireline telephone service, but the internet service it may not follow. And all we\u2019re saying is that communities that, you know, are eligible -- I mean, to our point, the issue is a fair price for internet. ", "13547 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. ", "13548 MR. GLUSTEIN: And we\u2019re not arguing with the telcos over what their rate of subsidy is per community. All we\u2019re saying is that they should be a fair price, and a fair price should -- the subsidy should follow. We don\u2019t think that the subsidy for internet will -- if it uses a means other than the telco network for distribution -- that it will necessarily follow the same way. That the end of the line may not mean more money than any other point in the line. You know, at the moment, the structure is designed to suit the telcos\u2019 distribution method.", "13549 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I want to go back to -- this is sort of my final question before I pass over to my colleagues for if they have any questions for you.", "13550 I want to go back to the idea of the renewable subsidies because -- and you brought this up. And that is the idea that does seem to be -- sort of fit in with your model, which is that you can adjust. Depending on what the financial situation is for the network then you can adjust and it can either go up or down or whatever. So that\u2019s a very interesting concept.", "13551 Now, I don\u2019t think I have at this time any more questions for you. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to bring to our attention?", "13552 MR. GLUSTEIN: Well, if I could just add on the issue of renewable subsidies. There are two reasons for it, why we proposed it.", "13553 The first one is because the technologies change really fast and the methods of distribution sometimes require additional equipment. Sometimes they could use the same equipment, you get more capacity out of them and the costs may not be reflected on the idea of a subsidy. The subsidy may in fact change because it should be based on real costs.", "13554 And the second reason is because the price of buying, for example, internet changes. It\u2019s reduced remarkably in the last -- in bulk internet it\u2019s reduced dramatically. And that these costs should be reflected so that what is a subsidy this year may not be the subsidy next year. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s all, which is our point. We said we\u2019re not -- that\u2019s one of the difficulties we have in determining an actual number because the numbers, they\u2019re a moving target.", "13555 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "13556 MR. GLUSTEIN: And I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s incumbent on the Commission to identify the numbers, you know, before you hand out the money. And, you know, we\u2019re not -- we -- all we\u2019re proposing is that there not be, you know, a single target, a single number, but that the number be based on a fair, on an affordable price.", "13557 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. ", "13558 There is -- I thought of another area that I\u2019d like to talk about. So I retract my former statement that I was ready to move on.", "13559 And what I\u2019d like to talk about, it just occurred to me, is the digital literacy and also the education part. When I read your submission I see that you have -- you do a lot when it comes to training people, training people how to develop the network and it sounds like technicians. Is that accurate? Could you tell us something about your training programs and so on for this -- for even doing the network?", "13560 MR. TURGEON: Well, the Cree School Board actually has many, many programs of online remote training or even on the site training using content from the Internet. ", "13561 Our schools, like Alfred mentioned, the phase one of the project connected 60, 65 percent of our schools, which allowed us to start offering content that we weren\u2019t able to do before. But we do have many, many training services offered and programs as far as -- they\u2019re for teachers. Some of them are for teachers, some of them are for services for students. ", "13562 It\u2019s as soon as we go out of the school building, that\u2019s the problem. The services cannot be offered to the homes for teachers, for parents, even for students because they don\u2019t have access to Internet. They want Internet and they can\u2019t even get it. ", "13563 So those services that we provide, yes, they are very good in the schools, but as soon as we go out it\u2019s -- it falls apart because of Internet connectivity.", "13564 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: It sounds like you have programs for technical training and so on for people to actually become educated in the area of telecommunications. Does that include fibre optic programs and so on? Are you -- is that something you\u2019re thinking about?", "13565 MR. TURGEON: That\u2019s the ECN program you\u2019re talking about. And I\u2019ll let Alfred or Raymond.", "13566 MR. LOON: I\u2019ll give it a shot. ", "13567 Yes, the -- altogether we had about three training programs under the guidance of ECN. And that all include, like the first one include what is broadband and very, very basic. Then the last one we did was a three-year program. And that consisted of all the major components of the telecommunications. When you come out of that you would be a qualified technician to work under the ECN or any other telco entity.", "13568 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Are you -- do you have an idea towards training people to actually do the network yourselves from within your communities?", "13569 MR. LOON: That was -- that would be part of the, you know, the plan at -- the future plan that ECN had is that ensure you have full qualified technicians. And also, the other thing that we will probably most likely do is with the Cree School Board is attend the career fairs and also visiting schools and informing the younger generation that what\u2019s coming to the community, like ECN, and all of its opportunities with it. That we -- that is part of the plan that we want to do under ECN.", "13570 MR. GLUSTEIN: If I could add just one point that in -- up to now, in terms of the courses that have been done, 33 graduates have found work in IT in the Cree communities. There\u2019s, you know, as many jobs as are available we were able to fill. We have more qualified candidates, by the way, if anybody\u2019s watching on CPAC and wants to hire one.", "13571 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Those are all my questions. Thank you very much and good luck with your project.", "13572 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. ", "13573 Vice-Chair Menzies?", "13574 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. And thank you for coming here. I know it\u2019s a bit -- some travel is involved.", "13575 It strikes me that you\u2019re pretty well situated and I\u2019m -- overall. Not that there aren\u2019t issues, but if the difference between $150 drop and a $300 drop is among them, these things are probably surmountable at some point.", "13576 Would you be willing -- you\u2019ve heard -- you may have heard or may not have heard Rogers\u2019 presentation yesterday in which following up on comments that the Chair made earlier this week regarding a coordinated national strategy that would serve remote areas, First Nations communities and others, that there be an advisory council put together. It strikes me that you have a lot to bring to that, particularly your experience with accessing transport that\u2019s outside of telco architecture with Hydro-Quebec. Would you be willing to participate?", "13577 MR. LOON: Yes. Actually, what was happening is that I -- sometimes I would get invited to speak to conferences about ECN experience. And yes, we\u2019d be gladly to participate on any advisory group on telecommunications, especially if it deals with the First Nation communities in northern regions.", "13578 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah. Yeah, I think you could, yeah, offer a lot. Anyway, that was only my -- my only question. Thank you very much.", "13579 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "13580 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "13581 I just want to understand a little better. Ms. Moses, you were talking about your personal situation and the struggles that you have faced personally trying to become connected. So today, within the region that you are planning to build your distribution, your fibre distribution, they are served by T\u00e9l\u00e9bec and there is a satellite footprint, so that\u2019s a possibility, and you\u2019ve got Bell Mobility. Is that correct? I realize none of them are looking to serve you right now, but you\u2019ve got those different possibilities within these areas?", "13582 MS. MOSES: Well, I started off by asking Shaw. And Shaw directed me to Xplornet and they have a base, I guess, in Chibougamau, Quebec. And they informed me that yes, they do provide internet and that I would need -- no, I didn\u2019t need a landline to be provided by Xplornet, but it\u2019s a satellite dish that I would require. However, the reliability is not great. During a storm I could have no Internet at all. And sometimes the speed is very slow. So that was my first experience of with Xplornet so.", "13583 And then because I didn\u2019t want a landline because I don\u2019t need one, I have a cell phone, and Bell told me that, well, without a landline you will have to -- the only thing we can provide you with is a hub or turbo stick. That\u2019s quite expensive. So I didn\u2019t go for either one. I\u2019m waiting for ECN.", "13584 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You\u2019re waiting for ECN.", "13585 So you have this plan to build fibre to the premise within I think you said 13 communities; is that correct? And it\u2019s essentially going to overbuild and compete against Shaw, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec and Xplornet; is that correct?", "13586 MR. GLUSTEIN: Well, theoretically, yes, except that T\u00e9l\u00e9bec ---", "13587 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Except they\u2019re not offering ---", "13588 MR. GLUSTEIN: Except they\u2019re not operating.", "13589 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah.", "13590 MR. GLUSTEIN: One has a stop sell, one has a capped limit on the Internet that makes it unaffordable. Yeah, so the answer is yes.", "13591 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "13592 MR. GLUSTEIN: We -- it\u2019s not -- this is not -- so the answer is yes, there are other providers, but it\u2019s not -- this is not a ---", "13593 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But there\u2019s frustrations in the community and lack of ---", "13594 MR. GLUSTEIN: Yeah.", "13595 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, yeah.", "13596 MR. GLUSTEIN: There\u2019s no service. I mean, it\u2019s nice that there\u2019s providers, but there\u2019s still no service.", "13597 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "13598 So you are out front pioneering the fibre transport to remote communities and now it sounds like perhaps you\u2019ll be out front of many communities and putting fibre to the premise.", "13599 And one of the things we\u2019ve heard through this proceeding is that we should certainly in anything we look at or recommendations that we should be technically agnostic and it should be the best technology for an area.", "13600 So how did you determine that fibre to the prem was the best technology in comparison to something like a wireless solution? We\u2019ve heard many smaller communities are best served by a wireless solution such as an LTE solution.", "13601 MR. MOSES: I\u2019ll ask my colleague here to help me out once I\u2019m finished.", "13602 I just want to point out that the communities that ECN would be serving is nine Cree communities spread out over thousands of kilometres of land and four non-Aboriginal communities mostly in the south, Chibougamau, Chapais, Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, and Mattagami, so that makes it 13 communities as well.", "13603 And at the beginning when we were discussing this when I was Grand Chief when we presented the idea, the concept of a fibre-optic high speed network that could service the Cree communities, you know, people looked forward to it, people were ready to jump on the wagon with it because of their experience with the services provided by the local telcos. ", "13604 And one must understand that telecommunications in the north is very, very important. It is an essential service, and when you get dropped off on your connections, you know, it means a lot to people.", "13605 We administer and manage millions of dollars by way of provision of services to our Cree communities and we move money around using the internet working with the banks.", "13606 So, you know, the people at the time were very interested in the fibre-optic network because it would bring high speed, there would be reliability and, you know, people are -- in politics you try to create -- improve the economy. You try to bring jobs, you know.", "13607 We have a young population. We are 18,000. Seventy-five (75) percent of that population is under the age of 25, and they all aspire, except for the babies -- not yet -- aspire to be connected through connectivity. And we were 6,500 in 1975. We have tripled. And we anticipate that -- our demographic statistics tell us that we will probably double by 2025, 30 -- so if we\u2019re 18,000 we\u2019re going to be over 35,000 with a very young population. I represent the one percent.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "13608 MR. MOSES: Maybe Alfred can add -- you know.", "13609 MR. LOON: Well, essentially the -- when we built ECN the highway was already there, so -- you know, and it\u2019s a matter of what would be the best -- what would be the best approach for the residents, and we said well, aside from internet what else can we offer. ", "13610 So we came with this idea of doing what you call a triple -- a triple-play, internet, video and IP telephony, and that would be a better quality system than a Wi-Fi.", "13611 So the ECN was already there in the community, might as well extend that part and do it just as -- you know, build this as a quality service as we had done with the entities, the Health Board and the schools, so we just extend it to the residents.", "13612 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So in your feasibility study you didn\u2019t examine other technologies you just ---", "13613 MR. LOON: Not before the feasibility study but before that we did a lot of talking and planning and that\u2019s the best solution we came up with, because we already have a fibre network might as well use that to its full advantage.", "13614 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "13615 MR. LOON: That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.", "13616 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Can I ask one more question?", "13617 MR. GLUSTEIN: Excuse me for -- can I add something? We had some experience with doing wireless programs in some communities on an experimental basis. There was one set-up in Waskaganish and there was one set up in Ouj\u00e9-Bougomou and the performance wasn\u2019t adequate.", "13618 So it\u2019s possible that it was the technology at the time, it was the equipment that was available, but it was, you know, just done on an experimental basis to see if it was -- what could be delivered, and we didn\u2019t find that the service was -- you know, we ended up with, you know, people who had Telebec modems stayed with them.", "13619 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "13620 As we\u2019ve examined this issue, and I had prior to this been part of an examination of remote satellite communities and so on and, you know, it really strikes me, there is very significant differences and disparities across areas of Canada in both what is delivered today and plans to deliver, and often it seems to really land with whether or not there\u2019s a champion for the community and how that champion takes forward the vision, if you will, you know, and looks for opportunities for funding, can explain what the benefits are to the community both economically, socially, culturally, and so on. ", "13621 And you have a champion and I see, you know, where you\u2019re moving, but when you champion this are you speaking of this sort of competing for funding with other infrastructure, or does telecom sit alone, or is it a vision where you\u2019re taking this and saying, you know, with investment in roads, with investment in housing, with investments in education there\u2019s also an investment required in a telecommunications network that connects us?", "13622 Can you tell me, you know, when you\u2019re championing -- when you\u2019re out there how -- what\u2019s the message? What\u2019s the message that has enabled you to be successful in moving forward this network whereas some parts it has not moved forward this quickly?", "13623 MR. GLUSTEIN: Well, just on the premise, we don\u2019t see telecommunications as disconnected from everything else. We see it as a part of the whole of society. So when we do an improvement in telecommunications it improves police services, it improves justice services, it means that -- you know, there\u2019s local courthouses in all the communities now. These things were never possible. But it also reduces the requirements on budget so the Grand Council doesn\u2019t have to pay to -- you know, to transport defence lawyers all over the place. You know, it\u2019s like something that can be provided for with telecommunications.", "13624 So it\u2019s not an expense it\u2019s an investment and the return on it is absolute. I mean, there\u2019s no question of -- whatever dollar is put into it comes back many times.", "13625 The federal government, which used to fly patients out of the communities, you know, on I believe it\u2019s called uninsured benefits, uninsured benefits that the federal government would pay, you know, is not there anymore. I mean, there was millions of dollars that were paid to fly people for medical appointments that don\u2019t have to be flown out for appointments anymore.", "13626 So if the federal government puts money in is the $13 million that it paid for, you know, uninsured benefits, is that an investment or is it a saving, no, we see it as it\u2019s a function of telecommunications. ", "13627 So we don\u2019t see -- it\u2019s not a question -- we\u2019re not taking money from water supplies to put money into telecommunications. We now monitor the water stations, you know, with telecommunications because we have the capacity, and so, you know, certain things can be insured whereas before they couldn\u2019t be. Somebody would literally have to go, you know, do the -- be on site. ", "13628 So in that sense, you know, it\u2019s not -- the Grand Council has been, from the beginning has been, you know, really remarkable because they\u2019ve always seen it as a voice for society and that a society can\u2019t exist without the voice. And it needed it. And that\u2019s sort of that\u2019s where it came from, you know. It was a rather daring leadership, I might say. Not that I\u2019m just trying to pass compliments across the table but in fact it was. It was quite the -- it was a risky effort and, you know, it paid off.", "13629 And so now when the network wants to expand it has to go look for its own money; it has to operate on its own, except it exists. It\u2019s a viable body, you know. It can function. ", "13630 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "13631 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you want to add something, Dr. Moses, on that on the question of leadership and getting the vision done?", "13632 MR. MOSES: Thank you. I\u2019ll take a shot at it.", "13633 Well, back at that time, 2002, the communications services was not satisfactory to the people, to the Cree leadership. And at the time when I was Grand Chief, when I started to know a bit more about fibre optic before that my knowledge was limited too. I was the first one in my community of Eastmain to have a fibre optic Christmas wreath and everyone thought, wow, you know, this is high tech at the time. And it was not connected to any fibre optic network; it was connected to the -- not even to the grid. To the generating station, the local generating station.", "13634 And the Grand Council was formed of all the chiefs of the Cree communities plus an elected representative and they all have experience on working using the local telco services. You know, at times you get dropped. I\u2019ve had many experiences with it where I would have telephone conferences with the chiefs in the territory, and you lose a connection and then it\u2019s hard to get back. ", "13635 You know, you try to have nine chiefs in nine different places it\u2019s difficult to get everybody back on the line. And people have commitments and their schedules and, you know, so -- and sometimes these drop-offs can be not just a few minutes, it could be hours and maybe even a day or two. ", "13636 That hasn\u2019t changed much. We still experience -- you know, I\u2019m in the north quite often and sometimes I stay at my daughter\u2019s place and get up in the morning and she says, Dad, you\u2019ll have to wait for an -- I don\u2019t know -- indefinite period of time. The computer is out. There\u2019s no service. \u201cWell, when it come on?\u201d I ask. ", "13637 She says, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a part of life up here.\u201d", "13638 And at the time the people, when they were considering this, the chiefs and myself we saw the need to improve the services up there for the benefit of our people, for the benefit of government, their own governments because they are -- they administer government services as well as the health, education, and the business sector of the Cree Nation.", "13639 And we saw the benefits of owning your own network which could provide, you know, high-speed internet service to the Cree communities. Basically, people just wanted to be connected to the rest of the world. We had been isolated for many, many years. And we worked hard to get airport services into our communities. We worked hard to control our own health and social services, our own health, education services, and it took a long time. It\u2019s only in the last few years that we had the road network completed that would allow us to drive in and out of our communities to Val d\u2019Or, Montreal, and Ottawa.", "13640 So with that in mind, you know, our leadership decided to embark on this new vision of a new challenge in trying to improve the telecommunication services into the Cree communities because it\u2019s very important. We communicate with each other, the Cree Nation with the Cree communities, the Cree communities amongst themselves. We have a lot of committees, you know, a lot of structures there that rely on communications as a part of their work. ", "13641 And of course, you know, when you own your own network, well, then you can also create jobs and train people. You know, improve among the local economy. Keep the dollar inside the community as opposed to going out and, you know, you can have the dollar circulate several times more. ", "13642 So it is with that vision in mind that we had. It was something new. It was challenging. It was not many people knew or understood about fibre optics. But as time went on we\u2019re getting to be experts.", "13643 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for that. I acknowledge that there are still gaps but I still think that your very rich experience that I\u2019m very happy that you shared with us in this proceeding, and will certainly inform our thinking and our reflection as we go forward. So thank you very much for having participated in this hearing.", "13644 We\u2019ll take a short mid-morning break, and then hear the last intervenor for the day. So why don\u2019t we break until 10:20?", "13645 Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10h20, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.", "13646 MR. MOSES: On behalf of the Cree Nation and the ECN, thank you for having us appear before you. Thank you very much.", "13647 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.", "--- Upon recessing at 10:09 a.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 10:21 a.m.", "13654 In light of the Panel\u2019s comment earlier this week to refrain the focus of this proceeding, the Commission has decided to modify the process to provide parties more time and an additional opportunity to comment on issues raised in this proceeding. ", "13655 The date of final submissions has been extended to May 25th. In these submissions, parties are invited to also include their views on a national broadband strategy for Canada.", "13656 Parties are also provided an opportunity to file final replies by June 13th. A revised Notice of Consultation with further details will be issued next week reflecting these changes.", "13672 The question at hand then, is how do we practically bridge the Internet divide and make a quality service available to the remaining four percent of our citizens?", "13673 Here are Cogeco\u2019s recommendations to reach that objective, further to your invitation for us to do so. They apply to the development of wired-in, wireless, satellite, and are therefore technology neutral.", "13674 First, for economically disadvantaged citizens living in communities where quality services are available. We believe that it is not the responsibility of the Commission, nor of private enterprise, to handle the plague of poverty, as troubling and unpleasant as it may be. This is definitely the role of governments, federal, in particular, as pertains to telecom services.", "13675 This means that low-cost packages should not be imposed on operators. Efforts and at low-cost housing, while laudable, are not the answer.", "13676 Only the federal income tax department is habilitated to identify who needs a subsidy. This consumption subsidy should take the form of telecom stamps, using the model of the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program.", "13684 Third, for populations living in very distant communities, economic studies will be required to better understand the costs and scope of the endeavour, for which we, as a company, are not equipped. However, based on our experience, we can categorically state that capital grants will be required to entice operators to build or upgrade, and yearly operating subsidies will or may be required to cover the excess operating costs inherent in serving distant locations, to the degree retail prices comparable to the national average are deemed advisable.", "13685 We believe that the Commission has the expertise and the data required to formulate the economic parameters of this strategy that we have articulated.", "13686 In our opinion, the Commission, based on the numerous observations received and giving due consideration to the ones we are tabling today, should present Innovation Canada with a formal recommendation for an immediately actionable strategy.", "13687 While forming a committee is certainly an interesting avenue, the fact of the matter is that the National Broadband Strategy as established in 2001, which I\u2019m holding in my right hand, is still valid. The principles that are stated there still apply today. What we need is to get the machine moving.", "13690 We believe that with the body of knowledge and expertise that currently exists within this Commission, the federal government would welcome constructive and practical recommendations and advice to channel the $500 million in new funds recently announced by Innovation Canada to their proper use.", "13815 And we said, well, sure we\u2019ll consider it, of course. And we sent our door-to-door sales force and we garnered a sufficient number of commitments to build. So we built directly in fibre to the home. ", "13816 And as I think was the underlying hypotheses behind Mrs. Molnar question, is that there are some area -- some localities where there is a champion. And there are many others where there\u2019s no champion, no one raises their hand, no one says anything, you know, take care of yourself. ", "13817 Okay, fine, we\u2019ll take care of ourselves, but if we can\u2019t get a sufficient number of customers, then why would we build unless someone provides financial help. And if the financial help is not forthcoming, then nothing happens. ", "13818 So yes, a champion is important. ", "13819 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you also have to have a business case, is that correct? ", "13820 MR. AUDET: That is correct. ", "13821 THE CHAIRPERSON: So whether, and the model you\u2019re talking about reminds me a lot of what Google did to insert in Kansas City where they asked to sign up a certain number of neighbourhoods, a bit of a competitive process, actually, but people had to say yes, they\u2019re committing for a period of time, and I guess that helps a business model. ", "13822 MR. AUDET: That helps tremendously. And in some cases, it can -- we might not have to turn for help, but that is the -- I would say it\u2019s the minority of cases that I have witnessed where there is a strong champion.

We will now hear the presentation of the National Capital FreeNet. Please introduce yourself and your colleagues and you have five minutes for your presentation.", "PRESENTATION ", "14094 MS. ROBINSON: Good morning. We appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. I'm getting over the flu, so I\u2019m a little gravelly. My name is Shelley Robinson and I'm the Executive Director of National Capital FreeNet, also known as NCF. With me today are NCF Second Vice-Chair Peter Chapman, and Board Member Peter MacKinnon.", "14095 NCF is a local not-for-profit alternative to commercial internet service providers. We are member-owned and governed. As a Bell re-seller, we offer high speed DSL with download speeds from 2 meg up to 50 meg and upload speeds from 0.8 meg to 10 meg, as well as free locally-hosted email, basic web hosting and dial-up service.", "14096 We invest in connectivity and offer speed and capacity that is equivalent to that available elsewhere. In addition to our staff support, we also have an award-winning volunteer-driven Help Desk so our members can ask questions about a range of internet and computer-related issues in person, on the phone, or by email.", "14097 We also offer workshops, we work with other community organizations to help bridge the digital divide, and we connect our members online and in person so they can share their skills. We are supported by DSL subscription fees, member donations, and project grants.", "14098 Fundamentally, we believe that everyone in Canada's National Capital Region should have access to the internet. In our case, that means that we believe they should be able to afford a high-quality connection, they should understand how to use it, and they should feel safe online.", "14099 NCF was founded in 1992 and since then, we have served more than 100,000 members. We currently serve about 5,000 members, of whom just over 3,000 are DSL subscribers.", "14100 Our in-house membership survey mirrors the findings in the Commission's Let's Talk Broadband report about the main ways our members use the internet, including email, news, health, work and looking for work. And they also suggest how those without regular and reliable internet access might be missing out on the benefits of the digital economy. As such, we concur with previous intervenors who have said that the internet should be considered an essential service for all Canadians.", "14101 We have members in every neighborhood across Ottawa, a number in outlying communities like Perth and Winchester, and about 100 members in Gatineau, where we can currently only offer 6-meg service.", "14102 So we\u2019re here today to speak to our experience as both a small ISP and a not-for-profit community-based organization, and we\u2019re going to focus on one of the biggest barriers we are told our members and prospective members across the region face in accessing the internet and its benefits, and that\u2019s price.", "14103 Many of our members are seniors, new Canadians, people with disabilities, and those living on low incomes. Many of these members have told us they rely on our service, but sometimes struggle to pay for it.", "14104 So we began selling the 6-meg DSL service in 2005 at a monthly rate of 29.95 for 322 gigs of capacity. In 2010, that rate went up a dollar a month to 30.95 a month to reflect an increase in our supplier costs.", "14105 We started offering fiber to the node service with download speeds from 7 meg up to 50 meg in 2013 and 2014 at rates from 30.95 to 49.95 per month. Our monthly dry line fees were based on Bell's tiered system and we charge between 7.25 and 16.20 per month.", "14106 In line with our mandate, we have never required our members to sign contracts, so they are free to cancel at any time.", "14107 So given its 8-year head start over the FTTN service, the 6 meg is our most popular, but our fastest growing service is 15/l meg. Monthly use on all our lines varies from less than 10 gigs per month of use to more than 500 gigs.", "14108 As stated in our previous submission, we will leave the determination of a minimum broadband speed standard to other intervenors and to the Commission, but we will note that the rise of internet-connected devices is driving demand for more speed within our membership. And that\u2019s not just among younger users, that\u2019s absolutely also coming from the seniors.", "14109 As a not-for-profit, we work to keep our prices affordable. Yet, to stay sustainable with rising costs, starting May 1st, so next week, we have had to raise our prices, albeit only for the second time in 11 years. So from two to $5.00 extra per month depending on the speed.", "14110 Given the increasing number of our members discontinuing their landline telephone service however, we are also reducing our dry line fees to $7.00 per month. This is particularly helpful for those in less well-served rural areas around Ottawa who were in the higher dry line rate bands, and those who have cancelled their landline as a way to save money.", "14111 On a related note, we field multiple questions a week in fact from our members about using VoIP as a way to reduce their monthly costs while keeping a home-based telephone.", "14112 To help our most vulnerable members, we are just about to launch a Community Access Fund that will subsidize part of the cost of our service for low-income members. We\u2019re currently working out the details of how the fund will operate. ", "14113 But with our own contribution and the public donations we can collect, we expect this will help a few hundred members and their families. So it\u2019s a great start. I said \u201cgood start\u201d, it\u2019s actually a great start, but we know the need to be much greater, both among our current membership and those who have said they want to use our service but they just can't afford it.", "14114 To that end, we support the recommendation of the Affordable Action Coalition for a subsidy for low income users, and feel this would tangibly benefit people across the National Capital Region and throughout Canada.", "14115 We also believe that these challenges would be better served by more community-based ISPs, working through not-for-profits like us and Chebucto Community Net in Nova Scotia, or at the municipal level like in Olds, Alberta.", "14116 Finally, NCF exists so that everyone in the National Capital Region can benefit from the internet. We look forward to the day this is a reality, and our part in making it so. ", "14117 Thank you.", "14118 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your presentation. I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Vice-chair Menzies.", "14119 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Good morning.", "14120 MS. ROBINSON: Good morning.", "14121 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Let me move this closer so you can hear me properly.", "14122 To start off, can you -- I noted when you first -- you noted 2005 as when you started services?", "14123 MS. ROBINSON: DSL services.", "14124 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: DSL services.", "14125 MS. ROBINSON: Yeah.", "14126 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So can you just give me the Kol\u2019s notes version of your history ---", "14127 MS. ROBINSON: Sure.", "14128 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- what was your genesis?", "14129 MS. ROBINSON: So 1992 we were started in -- at Carleton based on a professor and some interested folks there, and it was based on something in Cleveland called \u201cCleveland FreeNet\u201d, and it was this idea that literally we were free and that everyone would have access to the internet dial-up through these community portals. And so that\u2019s why we had like an insane growth in membership, I think we had 10,000 members in less than a year and everybody was -- was sort of coalescing around the idea that that's how they would get online and we limited it. So it was 10 minutes per login because it was -- the demand was so high.", "14130 So we did dial-up until 2005, so it was -- it peaked -- it actually didn\u2019t peak that much more before 2005, so it got its highest probably around 2002, I was looking at the chart yesterday but I don\u2019t remember the exact year. And then we were probably a little slow on uptake with DSL, by 2005 we started selling the DSL service at the 6 meg. ", "14131 Does that help? Is there something I missed?", "14132 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It does.", "14133 MS. ROBINSON: Okay.", "14134 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It sounds a little similar, at least its genesis to Chebucto in ---", "14135 MS. ROBINSON: Yeah.", "14136 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- in that sense, and it\u2019s not something we hear a lot about, but is a very useful conversation I think. I wanted to talk -- I have a few more questions but I'm curious to know about two things. First of all, there's been a lot of talk about digital literacy and you mentioned it in here in terms of working with your members on a number of issues and that\u2019s -- et cetera, can you tell me how that works in terms of -- you\u2019ve talked about for instance people with landlines and ---", "14137 MS. ROBINSON: M'hm.", "14138 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- working on the VoIP and that -- and that sort of stuff and you have some low-income members as well. So start with the digital literacy and how you pursue that or how that is meeting your member's needs?", "14139 MS. ROBINSON: Sure.", "14140 So since the beginning we've had a really active online forum discussion group system. So people will go on the forums and they'll say, blankety-blank, I have this question. And then other members will chip in and say, oh, have you tried this or think about this. So that though tends to be for folks who have enough digital literacy that they can in fact get on to the discussion groups.", "14141 So we also have, I mentioned, the volunteer driven help desk, that is where it all mostly happens. So it's very informal but it's also super necessary.", "14142 So we have a bunch of people who will walk in, sometimes with appointments, sometimes just walking in, and say everything from, you know, like sophisticated questions -- more sophisticated about like how do I bridge my modem, and then we'll have people who say I can't find the URL toolbar anymore. They don't call it a URL toolbar, but it's like their screen resolution has changed and so it's suddenly like not working.", "14143 Or they're -- I had a woman who came in last week and she had forgotten her password for her Hotmail, but she didn't also know even how to get into Hotmail because the link from the main page, someone had created a shortcut, it had gone. So she was like my Hotmail is gone. So it's just kind of saying to someone, okay, well, let's show you, and then taking them through the steps.", "14144 So that's the informal, and we're doing that on the phone and in person all the time, but then we also have workshops. So we had four workshops in a month last November that were super popular.", "14145 So we had one on protecting your computer. That was the most popular. I had to move it out of our office into an empty hair salon downstairs. We had one on basics of social media. We have one coming up on maximizing Wi-Fi, So a lot of people feel like their connection is slow, but in fact it's problems with their wireless, and so it's explaining it to them and then showing them. We had one on email. So the difference between like a mail client and a web-based.", "14146 So -- and then we just got a grant that's doing similar work. So it's for seniors specifically and we're going to have a smaller group and it will be more hands on help, so that instead of just sitting back it will be people saying, okay, now click here, and you know, do this, and yeah.", "14147 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Is -- that's excellent. Is data caps -- managing data caps ---", "14148 MS. ROBINSON: So ---", "14149 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- part of the issue -- one of the issues?", "14150 MS. ROBINSON: No, our data cap is really -- so it was 322 gigs. It was 300 GiB, so that's 322 gig.", "14151 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "14152 MS. ROBINSON: That's why it's a weird number.", "14153 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right, so it wouldn't be an issue for ---", "14154 MS. ROBINSON: Most people don't get near it. We have talked about providing increased education around, like, you know, if Netflix defaults to the higher sort of resolution, you know, you can bring it down. We also have a really big free period, so from 2:00 a.m. until noon.", "14155 And so it's seniors who mostly come in for a lot of these questions. They tend to be lower users, except when they discover Netflix, and then also -- and yeah. So we're there to tell them when they need it, but most of the time it's not been much of an issue.", "14156 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Have you had -- it strikes me that it might be very useful to some of the organizations that were representing, low income people, people in poverty, have you had any interaction with them?", "14157 MS. ROBINSON: So ---", "14158 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Because I mean your prices are more accessible than others that are available, so that goes some way to meeting need. Your data caps are high.", "14159 I was just thinking of a couple of people I spoke to a couple of weeks ago, you know, had overage charges and all that sort of stuff, and then I was reading about you. And I thought, you know, somebody at ACORN should point some of those folks to these folks and some positive outcomes might take place.", "14160 MS. ROBINSON: So -- yeah. Two weeks ago, ACORN had a Internet for all panel discussion. So I was there, and so I got to meet and present with some of the folks, actually like Blaine that you guys met, heard from. \"You guys\" is bad form. Anyway, the Commission met. But there was still a real challenge.", "14161 So people came up to me afterwards and were interested and I was telling them about the prices, certainly. But there is still that gap. So it's still too high for some people.", "14162 The number one thing that I am proud of, in terms of our service for lower income users, is that we don't have such a small cap. I think having a big cap matters a lot. So that's one of the ways we try -- and we keep our prices down and we want our caps high. Yeah.", "14163 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, particularly if you have teenagers.", "14164 MS. ROBINSON: Exactly.", "14165 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So in terms of the affordability. I was sort of looking at your pricing, right, and we've had a few discussions. You're a not for profit but ---", "14166 MS. ROBINSON: Yeah.", "14167 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- you're still around \u2013- it's still around $30. I mean -- and I'm trying to get a sense of how much -- when you're dealing with affordability, it's one of those things, because if you ask people do you think Internet costs too much they say yes, but if you ask people if they think almonds cost too much or cauliflower costs too much, they're going to say yes; right? But that doesn't mean they're wrong, it just -- you just need to try to get things in perspective.", "14168 So your costs -- you're basically operating on a cost-recovery basis.", "14169 MS. ROBINSON: More or less.", "14170 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And it's still around $30, right?", "14171 MS. ROBINSON: Well, in fact, it's now gone up to 32 for the six-month service as of May 1st, or it will.", "14172 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But you've got a compensatory deal on ---", "14173 MS. ROBINSON: I should have put in an appendix where I said all our ---", "14174 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You're offering to take -- save them $7 someplace else, though, right?", "14175 MS. ROBINSON: Yeah, but that's in addition. So the dry-lines.", "14176 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "14177 MS. ROBINSON: So that's part of what -- so for instance, for low-income users, a lot of them end up being dry-line users because they have cellphones. And so what that means is if you're on the 6 meg service, which is the cheapest, so it's 32.95 as of May 1st, and now we've normalized the dry loop for everyone, so it would be 7, so that's 39.95 a month.", "14178 There's not a lot -- we don't have a lot of wiggle room. I can say we are not cashing out at that level. The reason we had to increase our prices is because our costs go up, and as a reseller, we have some -- we don't have a lot control over...", "14179 So as use goes up, which it has dramatically, then we have to respond to that and then our office costs -- yeah. So there's not a lot of wiggle room, so it is -- that's what it costs us more or less, yeah.", "14180 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So ---", "14181 MS. ROBINSON: And in some cases, we're still not exactly covering everything we need to. We're just hoping that on balance it will cover it.", "14182 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So what motivates all your volunteers? What motivates you three?", "14183 MS. ROBINSON: Well, I'll let them speak to what motivates them.", "14184 MR. CHAPMAN: Yes, well volunteers. It is providing a community service. I mean, we recognize that Internet access has moved from being something that was nice to have and something used by students, to something that's absolutely essential to have for every member of the community.", "14185 So we're reaching out and we still meet people, particularly older people, who are intimidated and afraid of getting onto the Internet for all sorts of reasons. And one of the things we pride ourselves on is taking away that fear. Fear of not knowing the questions to ask, not understanding the nomenclature, and also getting surprises on their bill. We pride ourselves on a no surprises offering.", "14186 So in terms of volunteers, we see that as something we're providing to the community, particularly for the vulnerable and the, as I said, those who are afraid of something that they know they must have but they don't quite know how to get there.", "14187 MR. MacKINNON: Well, my name is Peter MacKinnon. I'll just give a brief comment as well in regard to that question.", "14188 Definitely, it's -- I'm involved in -- at the community level as a way of giving back to the community. As you can tell, I'm a little older than a 20 year old. So it's an effort to help out, and I've been involved with the National Capital FreeNet from the very beginning, in actual fact.", "14189 And I wanted to add to Shelly's comment that Carleton University has been a partner with National Capital FreeNet from the beginning, in '92, and to this day, our cage where we -- our servers are located is still at Carleton University. So there is a long-standing public/private partnership, if you like, in that regard.", "14190 So my comment is this, Peter has said as well, to serve our community and that's my role is helping out. Thank you.", "14191 MS. ROBINSON: And then some of the other volunteers on the help desk actually do it as a way to get job experience training. So we had a volunteer -- amazing volunteer from Venezuela -- who came and he worked really dedicatedly for a short while, got a job, and he left, and that's great. Like that's what we're looking for. Yeah.", "14192 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks, I understand.", "14193 So what specific actions could the CRTC contemplate to make sure there's room within the telecom, digital ecosystem for organizations such as yours?", "14194 MS. ROBINSON: Wow, it's such a great question.", "14195 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, I have some bad ones later.", "14196 MS. ROBINSON: Well, I'll luxuriate in this one.", "14197 The ecosystem. So I'm relatively new to this industry, so I'm still sort of getting the handle on the difference between telecom and broadcast for instance, but I think -- so that also frames my experience.", "14198 So I would say acknowledging that things are different for not-for-profits. It\u2019s different because we\u2019re a smaller group of not-for-profits who are playing in the telecom and tech side, but I would say if there are ways to accommodate those differences.", "14199 And then other than that, obviously we\u2019re saying we support the PIAC, Affordable Action Coalition low income subsidy, if that\u2019s possible, if that\u2019s something the CRTC can have a role in creating and other than that I would like to say I will keep you posted as I think more about it.", "14200 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Do you have a national -- are you I mean -- we mentioned Chebucto earlier and I\u2019m sure there are others, but is there any organisation like that, because I -- when -- frankly it reminds me of community radio; right? ", "14201 MS. ROBINSON: It reminds me of community radio.", "14202 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And I was thinking of you know when I had actually visited Chebucto in Nova Scotia a couple of years ago and it struck me this -- that that\u2019s what this is.", "14203 And -- but these people are doing -- folks such as yourselves are serving a lot of the needs that have been presented to us earlier in terms of affordability, in terms of digital literacy, in terms of you know, help -- adoption, you know, dealing with seniors.", "14204 Those were three of the social issues presented to us and then here you are, so you seem to have -- you seem to be serving a lot of those issues so that\u2019s what I was getting at in terms of that, is if there are solutions, people offering solutions to problems that are within the system.", "14205 Not saying that we can\u2019t contemplate doing things.", "14206 MS. ROBINSON: M\u2019hm.", "14207 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But one of the most efficient things we might be able to do is look at ways to ensure there\u2019s a place for people like you inside the system. ", "14208 MS. ROBINSON: I absolutely agree. I would say on the community radio side there exists a special place for community radio to exist that\u2019s kind of separate but alongside the other kinds of broadcasters and that\u2019s not true, at least as far as I know, on the telecom side.", "14209 Again I think it\u2019s a smaller -- but I would say it\u2019s important to foster that; right? So sometimes things grow when they have a space to grow into. ", "14210 So but as far as is there a national organisation, there\u2019s a group called TeleCommunities Canada, so they did write a submission.", "14211 So they\u2019re a kind of -- communities of practice is how they refer to themselves. There\u2019s no sort of NCRA, Arc du Canada, but also we\u2019re a member of the Internet Society of -- the Canadian chapter of the Internet Society. ", "14212 And so we\u2019re hoping to work more with them around these kinds of issues as well. ", "14213 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I think -- I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re aware of some of discussions that took place last week and presentations such as -- that most recently by Rogers in terms of talking about all sorts of steps that could be taken to work for a more cohesive national digital strategy", "14214 Do you see a -- what do you think of that, first of all?", "14215 MS. ROBINSON: I am not as familiar as I would like to be. Partly because I have been laid low with sickness, so I\u2019m not quite on top of -- like I don\u2019t want to say something that wouldn\u2019t be as precise as I would like to be. ", "14216 So can you please ---", "14217 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay so here\u2019s the idea without --", "14218 MS. ROBINSON: Yes. ", "14219 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- and a couple of proposals have been made and it followed a statement that the Chair made last Monday on our behalf, that when we look at the history is that there hasn\u2019t been a profound national digital strategy for many years. ", "14220 And that maybe it\u2019s time people got together and talked about that, so a couple groups, Bell and then Rogers, and others have discussed too --", "14221 MS. ROBINSON: M\u2019hm.", "14222 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- that those were the bigger -- biggest companies doing it suggested that there be a sort of a national advisory group put together for a couple of years to get all the stakeholders into the room and start coordinating. ", "14223 So if, you know, provincial governments perhaps to talk about, you know, if internet is a basic need why isn\u2019t it funded through social assistance. ", "14224 I think Yukon provides some money for telephone service, but we weren\u2019t aware of other provinces doing anything. ", "14225 If the -- if I said Industry Canada, the Ministry formerly known as Industry Canada has, you know, is $500 million in funding. ", "14226 What can other groups do to make sure that\u2019s not at cross purposes, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and what role can everybody play?", "14227 Do you think that\u2019s a great idea or do you think we should just do it?", "14228 MS. ROBINSON: Coming from a not-for-profit background, I\u2019m certainly always open to sort of offside stakeholder conversations. I think they\u2019re really important. ", "14229 I will also note though that smaller not-for-profit less well funded, less well staffed organisations tend to be even through no ill will, marginalized in those conversations. ", "14230 And so I think it\u2019s important, whatever happens, that the Commission still have a strong role in, you know, obviously making sure that things are sort of fair across the board.", "14231 So I would just be worried about being -- about kind of voices being drowned out.", "14232 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I understand that. Everyone needs a hero; right? So ---", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "14233 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Where do you think as we -- when we -- as we come out of this, where do you think we should prioritize our actions or create our priorities, I guess. Better way of putting it. ", "14234 I\u2019ll list some things that\u2019s in front of us.", "14235 MS. ROBINSON: M\u2019hm.", "14236 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Getting basic access to people in the north and other remote and First Nations communities; that would be one. ", "14237 And they\u2019re -- for anyone else listening there are other options but for the sake of discussion I\u2019m just listing two or three here.", "14238 Filling the gaps; we\u2019ve talked about that, you know, in what I call semi, quasi-rural areas.", "14239 MS. ROBINSON: M\u2019hm.", "14240 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You know where you just have these -- all of a sudden there\u2019s a street that got left out or there\u2019s 500 metres down the road all of a sudden there\u2019s difficulties.", "14241 The needs of the poor, continued investment and build of facilities and improving access.", "14242 So where -- if you had to take one thing first, where would you go for?", "14243 MS. ROBINSON: Oh, Peter would like to jump in and then ---", "14244 MR. CHAPMAN: One of the things that we\u2019ve become aware of is that there is a fundamental need for people either looking for a job or doing some basic service that they need in order to live their daily life, who -- those people don\u2019t actually require a great deal of gigabytes or whatever it is, in terms of capacity, but they do require that access to be available 24/7 and very, very easily available to them.", "14245 I think it\u2019s really, really important that everyone in the country has that access, otherwise they are deprived of basic services, as I said, looking for a job and things as basic at that.", "14246 However, at the other extreme -- excuse me. There are people who will use the internet service for watching T.V. and I\u2019m told -- I just saw a presentation where the average -- and this is in the Unites States, watches 5 \u00bd hours of T.V. per day, which obviously if you\u2019re doing that by streaming it on the internet, that\u2019s a great deal of capacity that\u2019s being consumed. ", "14247 So there has to be a balance between providing, if there is going to be some type of social program or subsidy, between providing the essential service and providing what one would regard as a somewhat superfluous luxury service and I think therein lies the dilemma.", "14248 And certainly that we\u2019ve become aware of in offering our services and promoting it to, you know, to the whole community, we see this wide diversification.", "14249 And it\u2019s not really easy to say which type of user is going to be a large capacity user, because initially you might think it\u2019s retired people and elderly people, but in fact they can be quite heavy users simply because they do have the time to watch and absorb a lot of information during the day.", "14250 And gamers, people -- you know, teenagers, gaming online for many, many hours, tend to be high capacity users. ", "14251 So to get back to my point is that the dilemma risk, in terms of providing some type of access for essential needs, it\u2019s the challenge is making sure that the essential needs are provided at a very, very acceptable price and affordable level. ", "14252 And at the same time not providing unnecessary subsidy to the heavy users who may not necessarily warrant such levels of support.", "14253 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That -- well that goes to the want and need discussion, I guess? But the -- more specifically, do you think -- I mean I think you\u2019re -- you have a 6 in 1 service, right? Does that meet most people\u2019s basic needs? ", "14254 MS. ROBINSON: So until May 1st, that one has had no connection fee, installation fee, and so most people have defaulted to that one and have made it fit their needs. My sense is were it not for that price differential most people would like to go a little bit higher, just like I said, because of the growth of internet-connected devices, basically.", "14255 So, yes, for people who are doing pretty limited things on the internet, six is fine. Although as a service we have found, anecdotally, that the FTTN service tends to be a better quality line than the entirely Legacy lines. But the speed seems to be okay. ", "14256 But now that we\u2019ve sort of normalized the installation rate and we\u2019ve offered 10, which we haven\u2019t had before, people are literally flocking to the 10 mg service. And then, like I said, 15.1 was our fastest grower. ", "14257 So I would hesitate to say that six is enough. Yeah, I would say people are choosing more than that when all things are being equal, yeah. ", "14258 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So what is driving that demand?", "14259 MS. ROBINSON: The demand for higher than six?", "14260 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes. And you were talking about in your presentation and previously, you talked about you had to increase your offerings because more and more folks were asking for it -- for more. So why are they asking for more? Is it an issue of multiple devised ---", "14261 MS. ROBINSON: Yes. ", "14262 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- in a household, or is it individual ---", "14263 MR. WRIGHT: It\u2019s ---", "14264 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- individual increases in usage?", "14265 MR. WRIGHT: When they\u2019ve had internet and -- when people have had internet and they\u2019ve tried it, they discover just the potential of it, and that drives the demand. ", "14266 A typical scenario would be a retired person who gets online because they\u2019ve been told they need email and then their grandson visits and introduces them to Netflix, for example, so --- ", "14267 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And then they know there's more.", "14268 MR. WRIGHT: --- they know -- they discover more, yes. ", "14269 MS. ROBINSON: But I would generally say -- so folks -- like, if you\u2019re a single person and you\u2019re watching Netflix, you can usually sort of get by with the six. So it\u2019s the multiple device kind of landscape. And I think that\u2019s only because of internetive [sic] things and I think that\u2019s only going to get driven more and more. ", "14270 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Just one more question, it\u2019s regarding -- you talked a little bit about people letting go of their landlines, ---", "14271 MS. ROBINSON: M\u2019hm.", "14272 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- in terms of that, and you counsel them through the bereavement process in some way.", "14273 MS. ROBINSON: yeah.", "14274 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Is that -- one of the things we\u2019ve talked about a little bit is, you know, people can use VOIP or they have mobile devices but VOIP. But then the landline has a certain sense of reliability to some folks. So how big is it an issue? Do you -- how big an issue is that, do you think, or is it not?", "14275 MS. ROBINSON: So our numbers -- because when I was preparing for the price change, I ran data, data, data, data. And so we now almost exactly match the last finding in the Monitoring and Evaluation Report so 45 percent of members is 45 percent of Canadians don\u2019t have landline service anymore. But it jumped, even within the last six months I think it jumped 5 percent.", "14276 So it doesn\u2019t seem to be -- but that\u2019s still less than half. But for those who are -- it\u2019s not the reliability; it\u2019s the ease, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say. When people call us about VOIP they don\u2019t necessarily want us to help them to set up their own VOIP, they want to know if we have a VOIP offering because they just want to make it work. They want it to be cheaper and they want a phone on their desk and they want it to work, and they don\u2019t seem to be as concerned with what if there\u2019s a storm or we don\u2019t tend to get those questions so much as just, like, \u201cHow easily and how cheaply can you make it available to me?\u201d", "14277 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you very much. Thank you for coming and for your presentation. I\u2019ll turn it over to my colleagues now, if they have any questions. ", "14278 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "14279 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "14280 Good morning.", "14281 I wanted to ask you about your community access fund that -- and it says there that you\u2019re working out the details. But how is it you will determine amongst your membership those that are low income?", "14282 MS. ROBINSON: That\u2019s a great question and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working out. ", "14283 So we don\u2019t want to put ourselves in the position of assessing need because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. And so we\u2019re looking at trying to establish kind of, for lack of a better term, sort of groups of buckets of people who are sort of preselected by membership in a group. ", "14284 So, for instance, it could be people who are receiving ODSP or people who are on Ontario Works. Or we had a program funded by the City of Ottawa Tennis years ago and that was for -- it was specifically for single mothers who were receiving some form of assistance. ", "14285 And so another idea was that if someone is a refugee claimant, then they would -- you know, so it would -- or it could be for -- obviously, our ambitions for the fund are quite big but our starting place is going to be quite small so that\u2019s why we have to sort of limit from the beginning. But eventually it could include people who are on EI, right, so that\u2019s a time when people most need the internet and yet are least able to afford it. And so, you know, there could be a subsidy for the folks who are on EI for the period during which they\u2019re on EI. ", "14286 Those are the things that we\u2019re thinking of but we haven\u2019t exactly nailed it yet. ", "14287 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. So you have a fund and the fund has been created how?", "14288 MS. ROBINSON: So we\u2019re taking $12,000 out of our surplus and then we\u2019re going to -- and then once -- so the Board has established the fund in principle and they\u2019ve agreed that we\u2019re setting aside that money from our reserve, and then we\u2019re going to -- once we determine how it\u2019s going to work -- also ask for public donations.", "14289 So it\u2019s not a separate fund right now. Like, maybe in the future it could be a freestanding organization but for right now it\u2019s an internal fund. ", "14290 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And you\u2019re not concerned about being the choosers of who is in need?", "14291 MS. ROBINSON: So that\u2019s why we would use groups who have sort of chosen by virtue of belonging by some other standard. ", "14292 But, yeah, we\u2019re absolutely concerned. There was a large -- because when people need support, like, you know, the Commission knows this probably better than we do at this point, there\u2019s like so many people -- it\u2019s like when Commissioner Menzies said the list; we don\u2019t want to have to choose one of those, you know, very worthwhile goals. We don\u2019t want to have to choose one group among, you know, very worthwhile groups and deserving groups. But it\u2019s also that we don\u2019t want to do nothing for fear of, you know, not helping everyone. ", "14293 So it\u2019s where we\u2019re going to start and then we\u2019re hoping we can build and grow on it.", "14294 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. ", "14295 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you have charitable status?", "14296 MS. ROBINSON: No.", "14297 THE CHAIRPERSON: So any contribution you would get from the public would be competing with other people\u2019s charitable donations.", "14298 MS. ROBINSON: Correct.", "14299 THE CHAIRPERSON: Where they would get a charitable donation.", "14300 MS. ROBINSON: Correct.", "14301 THE CHAIRPERSON: But not in your case.", "14302 MS. ROBINSON: Yeah. So the ideal would be to potentially set up a separate charitable organization in the future so that we could benefit from those rules. But, again, for now we just want to get her started. ", "14303 THE CHAIRPERSON: Which is laudable, although one could ask how sustainable it would be in the long term because it really relies on the -- your volunteer base, the willingness of your Board, and so forth.", "14304 MS. ROBINSON: Well -- so we actually have run on a donation model for a long time so that\u2019s how we make up some up some of the shortfalls when the DSL is not as entirely sustainable as it needs to be. And we have a recommended donation model for those who use our services and so we have money that\u2019s coming in. And so the idea would be the more sustainable the DSL service can be on its own, then the more we can redirect that money that comes in from donations that were currently support operations towards the community access fund. ", "14305 THE CHAIRPERSON: Some have come to our hearing to say -- while acknowledging that there may be an issue, saying it\u2019s a poverty issue, not a telecom regulatory issue or even a telecom policy issue. And that really it\u2019s -- other than maybe making some sort of recommendation, the Commission should keep out of this. ", "14306 What\u2019s your view?", "14307 MS. ROBINSON: My view is that if internet is an essential service, then the Commission has a role in trying to make sure that every Canadian has access to it. ", "14308 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. ", "14309 You might want to reflect on that in the future phases -- there\u2019s another phase on the 25th of May, another one on the 13th of June -- to add to the public record on that.", "14310 MS. ROBINSON: That\u2019s great.", "14311 THE CHAIRPERSON: So it would be good.", "14312 MS. ROBINSON: Thank you.", "14313 THE CHAIRPERSON: When I look at your model and Commissioner Menzies was asking how transferable it was, and there are other examples, I was wondering if there were commonalities. I mean, this region -- I mean, you talked about having an educational institution as an anchor. There always has been historically a rather important IT sector in the region. We also have a large public sector community here, which means whether they\u2019re retired or still active in the workforce, by that very nature they tend to perhaps be at the higher end of the income, the average income across the country, and better educated and so forth.", "14314 So when you look at the transferability -- I\u2019d just point out, maybe there are other reasons why it got off the ground well here. When one looks at the transferability of this model to other communities, what would be the elements, in your view, of success? ", "14315 Am I off base in my three assessments?", "14316 MS. ROBINSON: No, I think that\u2019s a fair assessment. I would also say there were ---", "14317 THE CHAIRPERSON: It doesn\u2019t happen everywhere else though, right, to --", "14318 MS. ROBINSON: Yeah.", "14319 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- have the confluence of those three?", "14320 MS. ROBINSON: Yeah, absolutely. ", "14321 Sorry, Peter had just said we\u2019re one of the few that survived. There were more and a number have gone away.", "14322 I -- again, I\u2019m going to come from a sort of community radio access position here which is that similar things can happen in different ways. And so they can draw on different resources in different communities. ", "14323 So I think it is possible for other communities to do this, although I think there are probably -- we were lucky in that we got a slower start; right? Because I mean, we got a fast start in terms of the uptake from -- but in terms of a 92, the Internet is not -- was not what it is today. And so I think there are probably barriers to entry today, but I also think that that\u2019s something that could be looked at as a way to -- when we talk about, you know, investment and innovation, having small community-based ISPs might be one way that, you know, we can foster kind of innovation at a different level. And so I would say it\u2019s possible because other communities might have advantages that we don\u2019t have here. ", "14324 So the number one thing I hear working for NCF is oh, you guys are still around. Because everybody knew us and not that many people still know us. And so that\u2019s our biggest challenge. Whereas, in other communities, you know, you might have that full community buy-in. So we have 3,000 subscribers in a city of -- well, in a region that certainly is, you know, a million-ish. And so other communities might have a smaller population, but the per capita buy-in would be much bigger.", "14325 So I would say it is possible but it\u2019s -- it wouldn\u2019t be the way we do it maybe but, yeah.", "14326 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So the size of the market also -- although where market and your philosophy just don\u2019t jive, I get that, but the size of the population.", "14327 MS. ROBINSON: Right. Yeah.", "14328 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "14329 MR. CHAPMAN: Can I just add the point that our cost structure is based on a per user cost plus the cost of running the office. And the problem with going to a small community is that overhead of the office --", "14330 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "14331 MR. CHAPMAN: -- spread over a much smaller revenue base. ", "14332 And so one of the challenges in doing that, and I think the model is transferrable incidentally, but one of the challenges is how do you provide the administration, the billing and all of the things associated with the head office to a smaller community. And there are models that would have to work on the basis that a number of small communities could share or some type of billing system or some type of system could then be made available to any other type of service provider that\u2019s based on the same model.", "14333 And certainly, our philosophy is we will share anything we\u2019ve learned, of course, very willingly and freely. So I think the model is extendable, but with that somewhat caveat that the cost of the overhead is something that needs to be addressed in establishing that.", "14334 THE CHAIRPERSON: How are you seen by for-profit resellers?", "14335 MS. ROBINSON: I would like to assume that we are seen. I think we\u2019re so small that we are effectively off the radar. So I went last November to the ISP Summit Conference.", "14336 THE CHAIRPERSON: M\u2019hm. Yes.", "14337 MS. ROBINSON: And it was great. I felt like I was there as any other ISP. And there was a for-profit ISP that almost entirely served the Polish community somewhere. So I felt like okay, so we\u2019re just going to interact on that level from our business side; right? And then when we\u2019re meeting with ACORN or other community-based -- so I think we have the benefit of being able to --", "14338 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "14339 MS. ROBINSON: -- play both roles.", "14340 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you\u2019re not seen as taking business away from?", "14341 MS. ROBINSON: I don\u2019t know. I would -- I don\u2019t think so. But if we got more successful, I\u2019m sure that would be the case. ", "14342 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "14343 MS. ROBINSON: Yeah.", "14344 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Thank you very much. As I -- oh, yes, please.", "14345 MR. MacKINNON: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to add one other point to answer your question. ", "14346 Natural Capital Freenet has typically had an executive director that has come from the IT community. And we have done something quite different in the last year. We now have Shelly as our executive director and she\u2019s come from, as you know, the radio community. And we think this is a really good step in reaching out to the community as a whole and not being driven by a techie. ", "14347 So to answer your question or to give you further insight, I think it\u2019s important who the executive director is in terms of their background.", "14348 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So the transferrable recipe needs to think about leadership as well; right? And who it is and what the skillsets are. Okay. Appreciate that. ", "14349 Thank you very much for your participation. And I eagerly invite you to participate in the next phases.", "14350 Madame la secr\u00e9taire.", "14351 THE SECRETARY: I will now ask Chebucto Community Net Society to come to the presentation table.", "14352 Please introduce yourself and you have five minutes.", "PRESENTATION", "14353 MR. ROY: Good morning, Mr. Chair, Members of the Committee. My name\u2019s Andrew D. Wright. I'm the Office Manager at the Chebucto Community Net. We're a Canada Revenue Agency registered charitable society and one of the oldest Internet service providers in Canada. ", "14354 As one of the last surviving community nets or freenets we offer both text-based terminal access as well as standard 56K dialup.", "14355 Since 2013, our Manors Project has brought a symmetrical 11 megabits per second wireless access for a $125 per year membership to residents, mostly seniors, living in low-income provincially-owned housing. In other jurisdictions people protest for $10 a month Internet. We're delivering it.", "14356 I'm aware this committee is familiar with the importance of Internet access so I\u2019ll just add for that, for those on the edges of our society this access can literally be the only lifeline they have.", "14357 In the two decades that I've been front and center in the struggle for fair access to the tools of communication, I've met many people and become the keeper of their stories as well as my own.", "14358 Married for 51 years, these high school sweethearts today live in a small apartment in public housing. Their health isn't the best and they have to pick and choose which prescriptions they get filled because money is tight. Luckily, they live where we can provide them high speed service. They get to save 90 percent over the commercial provider rate.", "14359 Next. No friends. No family. This person has had multiple heart attacks and is barely able to leave their home. Dependent on social assistance, near penniless, their computer came from one charity and their dialup connection, a major sacrifice even at $125 per year, comes from another, us.", "14360 Increasingly, dialup Internet access is problematic. Vulnerable to the slightest flaws in telephone signal and line quality, even when a user gets an excellent connection streaming media is impossible to access. Between programs downloading updates in the background and websites contacting literally dozens of other servers to assemble the page, even plain web browsing is almost unusable for many sites.", "14361 I saw an item just today saying that the average web page site has now exceeded the size of the original Doom video game.", "14362 We've proven that a group of citizens can offer faster, cheaper and arguably better service than commercial providers with virtually unlimited resources.", "14363 We say the answer to Canada's access woes is to empower non-profit community-based groups, such as ourselves, to build high speed infrastructure with a community Internet fund. Internet is relatively expensive to install. The costs are front end loaded. But once in, is cheap to run. Non-profit community groups can prioritize getting connectivity to those left behind by commercial providers.", "14364 Phase 1 of our Manors Project was funded by several Chebucto Community Net Board members acting on their own. I used to have a car. Now 309 residents in 2 10-storey buildings have low-cost public\u00adrun access. It was a good trade.", "14365 Phase 2. Two (2) more public-housing buildings and access for 261 more residents was funded by the Canadian Internet Registration Authority's Community Investment Program.", "14366 Phase 3. A large public housing Manor with 217 more residents was funded by the Nova Scotia provincial high speed research and education network, the Atlantic Canada Organization of Research Networks Nova Scotia.", "14367 We installed the necessary high speed hardware at a one-time cost of about $110 per resident.", "14368 You'll notice no government funding. Bureaucracies like the safety of large corporations. This week, the Nova Scotia provincial announced $6 million for bettering high speed access in the province. Meanwhile, the provincially funded Community Access Program, sole public access in many communities, saw its already meagre funding slashed even further. The provincial government doesn't even talk to Chebucto Community Net, let alone fund anything of ours.", "14369 In Nova Scotia, both rural and urban residents are being ill-served by the status quo, a duopoly between the Telco and the CableCo. Fibre and point-to-point wireless are the two delivery methods of choice. Solutions to our problems are available and being used elsewhere.", "14370 In Taipei Taiwan 80% of the city has fibre to the home, with the fibre running through the sewers. In urban Halifax, most everyone has sewer already. In Sri Lanka, similarly size to Nova Scotia, Google is using weather balloons with a life expectancy of 100-200 days to provide rural wireless access.", "14371 In northern England, farmers and rural residents founded B4RN, Broadband for the Rural North, putting in their own low cost gigabit fibre network where the commercial providers wouldn't or couldn't. Every seven o'clock, they have trenching parties, where they go dig out some more trenches, lay some more fibre. Three years, they've laid some 400 kilometres. ", "14372 In Halifax our Point-To-Point wireless connections are capable of up to 500 megabits per second with a range of 12 kilometres. And did you know that 1,000 foot of fibre optic cable is around $300 on eBay, and courses teaching how to splice it are free online?", "14373 We say that if you provide the funds for citizens to build their own networks, make it easy for them to get, the needed infrastructure will not just be built, it will be run economically and well. We're one example of many doing that just now.", "14374 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, thank you very much. Commissioner Molnar will start us off.", "14375 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Good morning. I heard the Vice-Chair mention just a minute ago that he'd had an opportunity to visit your organization in Halifax --- ", "14376 MR. WRIGHT: Yes, the seed for why we're here now.

What is -- can you tell me a little bit just so I understand better the network you've created?", "14380 MR. WRIGHT: Okay. Well, to bring the connectivity to those public housing buildings, we use a point-to-point wireless, so it operates 5 gigahertz frequency, like I said, speed of up to 500 megabits per second, and the range basically line-of-sight to the horizon. ", "14381 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you're not reliant on any of the commercial ISPs within Halifax to --- ", "14382 MR. WRIGHT: No, they wouldn't have anything to do with us. ", "14383 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right, and you say you've been at this for two decades? ", "14384 MR. WRIGHT: Yes. Chebucto Community Net was originally founded over the winter of 1993, and formally, I guess, the spring of 1994. ", "14385 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M'hm. We were talking to a group last week and I mentioned that it's my sense that often, addressing some of the sort of the needs of communities and residents that maybe don\u2019t fit into the traditional business plans of the established ISP, often requires a champion. And would you say you are the champion of Chebucto Community Net?", "14386 MR. WRIGHT: I would say I've got a well-developed sense of masochism, yes. ", "14387 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, I'm not sure that everybody's willing to sell their car for the betterment of their community, so --- ", "14388 MR. WRIGHT: It needed to be done. It wasn\u2019t getting done. Talking about it for years didn\u2019t do a thing. We figured if we gave an example that people could actually look at, that people could see, yes, this is actually doable, that they would follow. And well, the Canada Internet Registration Authority and ACORN Nova Scotia, the research group, they saw that and they helped support it. So I mean, we've basically supplied access to something like two to three percent of the needed -- the low-income population of the metro region. ", "14389 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. So I have a number of questions, and just following that, where you say the low-income residents in your population, I know that you talk about the Manors Project in dealing with the low-income housing institutions. ", "14390 MR. WRIGHT: Yeah, that was because they were basically an easy target. A lot of the sort of people we wanted to serve all in one place; we could get a connection to them. So they were the easy low-hanging fruit, if you will. Other areas, you know, other manors, there's some 40 of them in the metro-Halifax region, public -- owned by the province, run by the city. And you know, we were supplying access to, well, 5 of them. ", "14391 You know, others, they're not places we can get a signal to, so you know, we'd have to do something like tap into ACORN Nova Scotia Fibre or something to get connectivity to those guys.", "14392 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So low-income housing, there has been a pre-determination as to means testing to serve that community. One of the challenges with any kind of means testing program, programs to serve low income, is to identify who is low income. ", "14393 MR. WRIGHT: M'hm. I'd argue that, you know, everybody in Nova Scotia is being underserved and could, you know, stand for a public-run network, and not just, you know, seniors living in public housing. ", "14394 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M'hm. Your price is remarkable, $125, so --- ", "14395 MR. WRIGHT: Yeah. ", "14396 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- 10 --- ", "14397 MR. WRIGHT: No extra fees.", "14398 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- essentially $10 a month? ", "14399 MR. WRIGHT: Ten dollars forty-two cents ($10.42) or 35 cents a day. And yeah, we're running this thing at pretty much cost. Like I said, we sort of eat the investment of putting it in in the first place, all volunteer labour and you know, two of the phases were funded publicly, one we funded ourselves. But it seems like once you get that original installation out of the way, it's a free ride, you know, especially if you're, you know, peering with all sorts of other networks so you're getting free bandwidth from them as well. ", "14400 You know, your costs to run a network are ridiculously low. A good chunk of the Canadian infrastructure that has been built has already been paid for, and there's no reason why that shouldn't be running for free. ", "14401 In Danbury, Connecticut, they're putting in 20 megabits per second fibre for $15 a month. After five years, they plan on dropping that price to $5. after 10, they're planning to drop it to zero. ", "14402 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: The group before you was talking about help desk. ", "14403 MR. WRIGHT: M'hm. ", "14404 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So that's you? ", "14405 MR. WRIGHT: That's me. ", "14406 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You are the full volunteer support?", "14407 MR. WRIGHT: Well, there's a bunch of volunteers who handle a user-held mailing list similar to what National Capital FreeNet has, so that's sort of like a training ground for volunteers, if you will. They can see what answers are provided to questions, learn, start answering their own. That's actually how I got started with this.", "14408 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So are you also install and repair? ", "14409 MR. WRIGHT: Yeah. That fibre network -- or sorry, fibre -- that wireless network was put in by me and a fellow named Dave Johnson from a group called Fresh Group Atlantic, who also volunteered his labour. Yeah, we do it all. ", "14410 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M'hm. And you are a registered charity, so how were you able to achieve that designation?", "14411 MR. WRIGHT: That was something --- ", "14412 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That was you as well?", "14413 MR. WRIGHT: --- Telecommunities Canada did at the end of the 1990s. They got community nets listed as an educational resource, and so a number of community nets became charitable at that time. Some of them lost their standards since for various reasons, but you know, we've kept ours. ", "14414 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You have mentioned a couple of programs that you've been able to receive funding through. You mentioned Sierra as one. ", "14415 MR. WRIGHT: Oh, I'd have to call them saviours of networking in Nova Scotia. Sierra's community investment program funded two buildings for our Manors Project. It's funded the Halifax Internet Exchange, which is a peering hub in Halifax where networks too have gone to. They're funding with -- so the Community Access Program, A Tablet for Seniors Program, where seniors are being taught in -- you know, seniors who don\u2019t use internet at all are being taught to access it, you know, using tablets, for your simplest forum to teach people. ", "14416 So Sierra is basically doing everything that, well, the Nova Scotia government, the Halifax municipality, and the federal government aren't doing. ", "14417 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I'm looking at this and wondering if there are -- you know, the role of the Commission and the role -- clearly, there are organizations such as Sierra and community organizations such as yourself that are actively pursing --- ", "14418 MR. WRIGHT: With next to no resources, yes.", "14419 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. So is there a way, absent funding -- are there other roles that the Commission could take that would perhaps help you coordinate things; discoverability of sources of funding, for example? Like, Sierra has come up -- I'm not sure how you made that relationship?", "14420 MR. WRIGHT: Twitter. They saw us on Twitter. ", "14421 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: They saw you on Twitter? Would you see that there is a way to increase your visibility so that commercial organizations or organizations, such as this could find you ---", "14422 MR. WRIGHT: Yeah, well ---", "14423 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- at the source of (inaudible)?", "14424 MR. WRIGHT: --- I had a conversation at a hotel restaurant last night with some people from openmedia.org. Now, these are presumably people informed about, you know, network access across the country, and I was kind of surprised at the fact that they really didn't have any idea of what was going on in Nova Scotia. Well, I guess we're like somewhere out in the sticks for you guys.", "14425 But if the informed people don't -- I've got to think like, you know, well people in power have even less knowledge of us, and the situation, and you know, we've basically stepped in because nobody else was. And sort of saying, well, you know, gee guys, you're doing a great job, keep it up. That's not really a help.", "14426 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: The vice chair asked the last panel about priorities.", "14427 MR. WRIGHT: M'hm.", "14428 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: If there was one priority for this commission that would help you, what would you see that to be?", "14429 MR. WRIGHT: I'd say that we're living in an age where we're essentially building the nervous system for the planet. I'd be arguing that what we should be doing is going on, you know, essentially a moonshot-style prioritizing of this. That we should be bringing the highest possible speed uploads and downloads to every part of the country, just slamming that stuff down.", "14430 Interest rates right now are like the lowest in history. So is like the time to be doing that kind of investment. It literally could not be more perfect.", "14431 We are basically punishing regions of the country because they are, you know, considered out of reach, inconvenient. The North, you know, the coast areas with a low population. What we should be doing is slamming that stuff in the same way as we slammed power lines at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.", "14432 Because when you have like a system with, you know, slow upload speeds and, you know, relatively slow download speeds, you're seriously crimping the economic development of that region. There is like people who have to leave Nova Scotia because they're working on video files, or what have you, and they literally cannot upload the stuff fast enough.", "14433 I watch people like doing sneakernet with portable hard drives all the time for large datasets. You know, this is nuts.", "14434 We should be slamming in fibre everywhere; we should be making this a priority. Like that's where you guys could be coming in. I mean, there should be public owned, public run, low cost fibre access, you know, it would recover its costs within a decade, we'd be running it for the next century.", "14435 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you.", "14436 Those are my questions.", "14437 THE CHAIRPERSON: Vice-Chair Menzies?", "14438 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Just a comment and a question you don't have to answer.", "14439 Did you take the train?", "14440 MR. WRIGHT: Yes.", "14441 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "14442 MR. WRIGHT: You can tell.", "14443 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, no.", "14444 --- . LAUGHTER/RIRES)", "14445 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I saw it somewhere. I just wanted to thank you for accepting the invitation to come and giving a very eloquent presentation. Thanks.", "14446 MR. WRIGHT: Thank you.", "14447 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner MacDonald?", "14448 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good morning.", "14449 Congratulations on what you're doing in Halifax.", "14450 You have had some success in getting some funding to build out some of these buildings, and I'm wondering how you came to receive that funding? Is it a grant process that you're currently looking at different organizations and submitting proposals? How were you able to obtain that funding?", "14451 MR. WRIGHT: Well, we've had very, very poor luck with grants. In fact, we've pretty much given up on ever doing on ever again a couple of years back just because they were so futile. There was always monstrous amounts of paperwork and months and months of wait to hear that no you didn't get it. So we're basically, okay, nuts to that noise.", "14452 So a few years ago, like I said, we started posting things on Twitter, which started attracting a bit of attention. All of a sudden, some of the local politicians knew who we were; the local news media knew who we were.", "14453 And we got basically an invitation from CIRA, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, to apply for their community development program. They had seen the sort of stuff we were up to. They had seen -- well, our Phase 1 of the Manors Project, basically.", "14454 So that funding was pretty much a one shot deal. Like yes, we've got enough to do two buildings, but it's not like we can keep going back to CIRA every year.", "14455 With the local high-speed research network, again, they wanted to do some community support, and again, that was a one shot, so you know, we can't go back to that pool either. And as I said, the province and you know, the city, they like talking to corporations. So if they have millions to give somebody, that'll go to a corporation.", "14456 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And on that topic, I mean, you're providing service to constituents of municipal politicians and local MLAs, you're providing service to individuals that are receiving social assistance.", "14457 MR. WRIGHT: M'hm.", "14458 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Have any of those organizations provided any concrete rationale as to why they don't want to have more in-depth conversations with you or ---", "14459 MR. WRIGHT: You're going to love this.", "14460 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- provide some support?", "14461 MR. WRIGHT: Yeah, well in the manors, the basic thing is that these manors are the low-income public housing. They're owned by the Province of Nova Scotia, they're run by the city.", "14462 Now, the way they get around doing anything extra is when you talk to the city they say, oh no, that's provincial, we don't have that -- you know, we can't give money to anything provincial; and when you talk to the province, they say, oh no, that's the city running that. So they basically both wash their hands of it.", "14463 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And just one final, just so I can get an idea on the return on investment.", "14464 Approximately what would it cost to bring one more building online with your service?", "14465 MR. WRIGHT: Okay ---", "14466 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And I know that may vary depending on the number of different variables and the size of the building.", "14467 MR. WRIGHT: Call it a 10 storey building, like that's the pretty much the average height of the various manors that we have done. We buy top of the line wireless equipment. Like that's the first decision we made is not to cheap out on the hardware because, you know, we want the thing to run reliably and for years.", "14468 You know, part of the whole deal in the first place is you do it right the first time you don't have to worry about it afterwards. So that's the big thing.", "14469 So basically, well point to point wireless is about $1,200 for the two wireless bridges, the access points are around 650 a piece, and we generally put two every second floor through the building. So you know, by the time we get all the bits and bobs and wires, and yada yada, something on the order of $10,000 to do a 10 storey building with just the hardware and us volunteering the labour.", "14470 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So about 10 grand to service about 300 residents?", "14471 MR. WRIGHT: Yeah, like I said in the presentation. It was about $110 per unit to put it in. They spend more than that on locks.", "14472 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "14473 Good, thank you very much.", "14474 THE CHAIRPERSON: Speaking of paperwork. How hard was you to get a charitable status and to maintain it?", "14475 MR. WRIGHT: Very, very easy. Maintaining is simply a matter of well doing things honestly and filing your taxes on time.", "14476 THE CHAIRPERSON: And has it been beneficial to your operations?", "14477 MR. WRIGHT: Well, yeah. I mean, donations are -- I don't have the exact percentage off the top of my head -- but something like 10 percent of our income.", "14478 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, which is not insignificant.", "14479 And earlier, I asked a question -- I think you were in the room -- about what might be the winning combinations for community-based solutions to emerge. Do you have a view on that?", "14480 MR. WRIGHT: I'm not sure about the question.", "14481 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'd referred to the fact that maybe in Ottawa the fact that there was an educational institution as an anchor that started off the operations of the previous -- the National Capital FreeNet -- was part of the -- might have been the solution that -- why that emerged and continues. The fact that we have an IT sector in the area, the fact that because of the public sector, the socioeconomic profile, the region is a little bit stronger, and of course, local and dedicated leadership, like yourself, is also very helpful.", "14482 Do you have a view on that as to ---?", "14483 MR. WRIGHT: Well, similar things (inaudible). Basically, at one time there were community nets all over Canada. Now, I believe there is seven surviving. We're the only ones east of Ottawa.", "14484 We are partnered up with Dalhousie University, specifically, their Department of Mathematics and Statistics, who have provided us a home since 1994. It gives us great physical access to the high-speed network, which is literally about 30 feet outside my door.", "14485 We use the Dalhousie fibre network, you know, for our own uses, where, for example, the buildings that we're using the feed the connections to the manors are Dalhousie buildings, where we put something -- a bridge on their roof and broadcast as a connection to another place. We buy our bandwidth from Dalhousie, which is nice because, of course, they bulk buy from larger commercial providers.", "14486 The reason we're able to offer the symmetrical service of 11 megabytes per second is because we've got that solid connection. If we were trying to buy off ATELCO, we would be getting one of these ridiculous huge download/small upload things.", "14487 As far as usage too, like we found -- we were very surprised by how much video the seniors used. Our heavy users are pulling back something like 350 360 gigabytes a day, which is, you know, somebody -- well, the local cable co's monthly data cap is 250. So you know, some of our users blast through that in a day, and then some.", "14488 I'm -- I'd be thinking our 11 megabytes per second is actually a little on the slow side. We could probably increase that a little and -- to meet demand. Again, we were kind of surprised, we figured seniors would be sort of low users, but it turns out no, not so much. It\u2019s a smaller percentage of seniors using it, but the ones that are are quite active.", "14489 A lot of things are things like high definition video for people\u2019s homelands. So you know, users from China or whatever are watching video from China, users from India are watching videos from India, that kind of thing where they\u2019ve got a link to their own homes now that they didn\u2019t use to have.", "14490 I guess I'm kind of rambling here but you got to get the point.", "14491 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, so -- yeah, so that\u2019s a fair point. We sometimes come with unarticulated assumptions about how older Canadians consume content which might not actually be correct. Having to introduce my own 87-year old mother this weekend to the benefits of online streaming to a -- to Two.tv, which is a French language -- we shall see what comes to that, but early reports are quite encouraging that she\u2019s enjoying it.", "---(LAUGHTER)", "14492 THE CHAIRPERSON: We\u2019ll see what happens to the internet bill after that. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- once you understand it, it\u2019s not that difficult and we shouldn\u2019t perhaps assume that they are unable to do so.", "14493 So -- and volunteers of course are important to the formula, I would think; right?", "14494 MR. WRIGHT: M'hm.", "14495 THE CHAIRPERSON: What motivates your volunteers?", "14496 MR. WRIGHT: Well, I think it\u2019s kind of once you're in with the volunteering then you realize, hey, hundreds of people not depend upon you, you can't quit. So that\u2019s a big part of it. Ideally a community net operates as like a pool, you know, people with no education or whatever can volunteer, learn skills and then apply those skills elsewhere. We\u2019ve acted as a training ground for quite a few people who\u2019ve come along, you know, learned how to manage machines and stuff then moved on to the commercial sector with that skills.", "14497 So if you're doing it right, you're getting a steady stream of people interested in what you're doing and -- well, going for self-improvement as well as helping out the community.", "14498 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, thank you very much for you answering the questions. Actually I should be fair to my mother, she\u2019s not quite 87.", "---(LAUGHTER)", "14499 THE CHAIRPERSON: I might hear about that, so she\u2019s -- soon, but not yet. So thank you very much for participating in the hearing.", "---(SHORT PAUSE)", "--- Upon recessing at 10:35 a.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 10:50 p.m.", "14625 LA SECR\u00c9TAIRE: We will now hear the presentation of Saskatchewan Telecommunications, SaskTel, please introduce yourself and your colleagues.", "PRESENTATION", "14626 MR. MELDRUM: Good morning, Mr. Chairman and I am SaskTel\u2019s Vice-President, corporate counsel and regulatory affairs. Before you proceed with our submission I would like to ask the Commission\u2019s to introduce a one page exhibit, representing the increased coverage in Saskatchewan, once certain connecting Canadians projects are complete. ", "14627 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: Okay. Let\u2019s do that. I think we\u2019re up to number 6 for this -- it\u2019s just a map. It\u2019s not any additional data points? It\u2019s just to help conversation I take it?", "14628 MR. MELDRUM: Yes.", "14629 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Good. Number 6; thanks.", "14630 MR. MELDRUM: Thank you. ", "14631 I am pleased to introduce our panel today. To my immediate left, Katrine White, Vice President, Consumer Sales and Solutions; to Katrine\u2019s left, Ron Styles, our President and CEO; to Ron\u2019s left, Daryl Godfrey, SaskTel\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. ", "14632 In the second row, directly behind Ron is Bill Beckman our Senior Director of Regulatory Affairs. To Bill\u2019s right is Andrew McKay, Regulatory Affairs Manager, and to his right is Jamie Patterson, Associate Corporate Counsel. ", "14633 I will now turn you over to Ron Styles.", "14634 MR. STYLES: Good morning. ", "14635 Good morning. We\u2019d like to start by commending the Commission on the decision it made in 2011 to continue the local voice access regime and introduce an aspirational broadband regime. ", "14636 This framework has allowed Canadians to continue to use affordable voice service to meet their commitments -- their communication needs, while at the same time enabling a combination of market forces, technological advancements and targeted funding programs to bring Canada to the point where the aspirational broadband targets are largely met.", "14637 I\u2019d like to tell you about a few of the achievements SaskTel has made under the CRTC\u2019s aspirational regime.", "14638 Over the past 5 Years, we have spent over 1.5 Billion dollars in capital. Much of this has gone toward bandwidth improvements.", "14639 We have built out our fibre-to-the-home network so that it now allows over 30 percent of Saskatchewan\u2019s households to have access to download speeds of up to 260 megs and upload speeds of up to 60 megs.", "14640 We have upgraded over 30 communities, rural communities, to 5 megs and 235 communities to 10 megs.", "14641 We have brought 5 megs service to 19 First Nations and 1.5 megs to 34 First Nation communities; six (6) of which will soon be enhanced to 5 megs service.", "14642 With support from Indigenous and Aboriginal -- and Northern Affairs Canada, we are working to provide 89 on-reserve schools with dedicated 10 megs connections.", "14643 In partnership with Health Canada, we are working to provide 79 First Nations health facilities and treatment centres with dedicated 10 megs connections.", "14644 With support from the Connecting Canadians program, we will be bringing 5/1 broadband service to 26 remote northern communities, including 3 that had no previous service, by the end of this year.", "14645 In rural areas we have introduced a fixed wireless technology that provides 5/1 service to rural residents in in the coverage area and we hope to increase that to 10/1 later this year.", "14646 We also look forward to further understanding the Government of Canada\u2019s recently announced plans to spend up to $500 Million over 5 years, to extend and enhance broadband service in rural and remote areas, and $255 Million over 2 years on a First Nations Infrastructure Fund, which will support investments in a range of complementary infrastructure including broadband connectivity.", "14647 Our past successes and these recent announcements support our position that the Commission does not need to introduce prescriptive measures, which would set specific immediate targets with rewards for achieving them and penalties should they be missed. ", "14648 The best way forward on broadband is to set new aspirational targets and then rely on the market, technology and targeted government programs to achieve them. ", "14649 It is not that we think that broadband evolution has reached an endpoint at 5 megabits per second. We do however believe that 5 megs is sufficient for customers to access the digital economy today and that the Commission does not have to introduce prescriptive regulations to further ensure this access. ", "14650 The Commission\u2019s Exhibit 1, which was filed earlier, confirms this, but we do aspire to deliver far more. ", "14651 We believe that more and more bandwidth will be important to our customers and we intend to do everything we can to build it for them. ", "14652 As you know, SaskTel is a provincial crown corporation. Our mandate is to connect the people of Saskatchewan with the best communications services possible and not simply to generate profit. ", "14653 This means that in some cases we undertake investments that are only marginally profitable. However, we must always be careful stewards of the Province\u2019s investment and remain cognizant of cost and the need for a reasonable return.", "14654 Having said that, whether or not you set new aspirational targets, we will continue to build and enhance our network.", "14655 We will build because the market is driving us to; we will build because technology will advance and allow us to; and we will build because we have been successful in pursuing funding from government sources, businesses and communities, which allows us to make investments in communities which would otherwise be unserved. ", "14656 And if the Commission does institute an industry-funded regime, which we do not believe is necessary, we\u2019ll chase moneys from that too.", "14657 Although 5/1 allows Canadians to participate in the digital economy, the Commission needs to set a higher aspirational target. Five-one (5/1) is largely reached. ", "14658 Further progress means you need a higher target to review future progress against it. ", "14659 And, as the Government of Saskatchewan -- or Government of Canada, pardon me, refines its plans to spend hundreds of Millions of dollars improving broadband service, they need a target to base funding awards on as well. ", "14660 SaskTel believes 10/1 appropriately reflects today\u2019s technological and societal reality of the future.", "14661 We also urge you not to forget about those Canadians who have not yet transitioned to the digital economy. ", "14662 SaskTel envisages a time when the Commission will no longer have to enforce a basic service objective for traditional voice. ", "14663 However, the evidence clearly shows that that time is not yet here. While some consumers are cutting the cord, many others continue to value this service. We believe no significant change in the voice framework is required.", "14664 MS. WHITE: As Ron mentioned, part of SaskTel\u2019s mandate as a Crown corporation is to connect the people of Saskatchewan with broadband service. Today we serve over 88 percent of Saskatchewan households with at least 5 megs service and by the end of 2017 there will be as few as 30,000 underserved households mostly due to not reaching 1 meg upload speed.", "14665 SaskTel is very proud that we have to date been able to place fibre-to-the-home facilities past 140,000 homes. We have deployed fibre in the most competitive communities across the province and areas with the greatest market potential. However, we also continue to expand our 5 and 10 megs service to rural communities. Just this month we rolled out 5 meg service to the village of Craven and 10 meg in Alvena and Riverhurst. According to the 2011 census these communities have 111, 36, and 105 homes respectively. ", "14666 SaskTel\u2019s wireline broadband service is different than many of our competitors. We do not have contracts; we do not charge for equipment; usage is unlimited with no throttling or overage charges; we do not charge termination fees; and our customers benefit from bundle savings when they purchase other services like TV, long distance, or mobile. ", "14667 The uptake of our fibre network is growing and we are noticing an interesting trend. In communities with a fibre network, although we offer download speeds of up to 260 megs, most customers are taking speeds less than that.", "14668 Here is an example. SaskTel is working toward making the City of Moose Jaw the first fully fibre-fed community in Saskatchewan and we have passed most of the homes in that city. Customers who convert to fibre are offered our 100 meg service at a promotional rate, but after the promotion ends we find that our most popular speed is an 8 meg service, the second lowest of six available options. A small percentage of our customers stay on the 100-meg option after the promotional period, and a very few upgrade to the highest speed available.", "14669 Similarly, in those DSL communities where customers can purchase a maximum of 25 megs or 10 megs, a majority subscribe to speeds of 5 megs or lower.", "14670 It\u2019s likely that demand for higher speeds will grow over time, and we have invested a great deal of money based on this assumption. But the time when most customers are willing to pay for exceptionally higher speeds is not yet here.", "14671 Even at 5 megs most consumers can do everything they want to do on the internet. At this speed, a customer can choose to browse a website, retrieve information related to a government service, shop, access social media, or watch an educational video online.", "14672 The evidence in this proceeding has shown that the most critical components of the digital economy can be accessed using the current aspirational broadband targets and that the true drivers for increased bandwidth demands are entertainment services like video and gaming. ", "14673 Submissions in this proceeding list video applications and the desire for multiple devices to be online at the same time as the drivers of the perceived need for additional bandwidth.", "14674 SaskTel agrees that higher bandwidth video and multiple concurrent users drive demand for faster broadband. We\u2019re happy to respond to customer demand for such bandwidth where we can do so on a cost-effective basis, but neither video entertainment nor multiple users at one household should lead the Commission to introduce a prescriptive regulatory intervention.", "14675 Our next important observation is that the market is not asking for higher upload speeds. That is why SaskTel has no service options that offer the same download and upload speeds. ", "14676 As an access provider in a competitive environment, we understand our need to meet market demands for higher broadband access speeds and even for higher upload speeds, if a customer asks for them in the future. The current aspirational regime, with increased download target speeds, is the most effective way to ensure that the industry continues to adapt to demands of consumers. However, a prescriptive regulatory intervention is not required. ", "14677 MR. GODFREY: As Chief Technology Officer, I have seen great changes in networks over the years. The capabilities of various technologies have expanded beyond limits which had been commonly accepted and the clear lines between wired telecom, cable TV, satellite, and wireless services have become blurred. The pace of network change is ever-increasing. Technologies are introduced, they are the best thing we have ever seen, and five years later they are approaching obsolescence. ", "14678 As these technologies develop, network architectures which were once seen as the best solution to a problem become superseded by other architectures. ", "14679 When dial-up was prevalent, the only way to get access to the internet without your teenagers monopolizing your voice line for hours at a time was to install a second copper loop. Then DSL was developed, voice and data were available on the same network access, and many second loops became redundant. As DSL standards progressed, speeds increased. ", "14680 In order to achieve these speeds, we had to place serving equipment in nodes so that the copper loop was short enough to provide those higher speeds. Originally nodes were placed so that copper loops were no more than four kilometres, which allowed us to deliver 1.5 megabits per second using ADSL electronics. ", "14681 With the introduction of ADSL2+ and further advances in DSL, we can now deliver 5 meg over this same distance. Newer builds require copper loops not longer than 2.2 kilometres for 10 megabits per second and 900 metres for 25 megabits for second. With fibre-to-the-prem, we are now choosing to overbuild the entire copper portion of many communities. ", "14682 Fixed wireless technology has also progressed. We have some very small communities in Saskatchewan, along with highly dispersed farms and rural dwellings. Previously, the only way for SaskTel to provide 5 meg broadband service to many of these areas would have been using a direct fibre connection because they are too dispersed for a node-based solution to make sense. Because the regime was aspirational, we were able to wait and we can now deploy our Fusion fixed wireless service, offering customers 5 meg down and 1 meg up. We will soon launch the ability to access 10/1 speeds on this technology. And we are hopeful that even greater speeds can be reached with technological advancements that are already in the pipeline.", "14683 As a facilities-based service provider, we have to deal with this evolving technological environment. We have to look at what our existing facilities can do, what we could deliver given various network builds, what potential future changes in electronics may allow us to do, and the cost and timing of all of these options. ", "14684 And we have to compare that to what we think our customers will demand and what we think our competition will be offering. We also must consider any regulatory obligations that might force us to resell our network to our competitors at prices that are unreasonable. Deciding on a network build in light of all of this is a significant decision for us. But it is our decision.", "14685 Each service provider must face these choices and make their own decisions based on their perceptions of the various options. This introduces competitive diversity which is a sign of a healthy market. The fact that different service providers will make different choices also increases the likelihood that there will be an option in the market to meet the needs of each consumer. ", "14686 As service providers these are the risks we face with any network deployment. As a regulator, the Commission should avoid forcing network deployment choices in order to meet a prescriptive target. ", "14687 One of the choices an aspirational regime has allowed us to make is to focus our energy and limited capital dollars on projects focused primarily at improving download speeds rather than on projects focused primarily on upload speeds. Focusing on upload speeds would benefit fewer customers, not just because the market demand is not there, but also because the cost per customer is higher and therefore less network can be deployed with the same capital.", "14688 The reason for this is copper loop length. Because DSL services have been traditionally designed by suppliers to be asymmetric, achieving 1 megabit per second upload in areas where copper loops are currently greater than 1,200 metres requires us to install more nodes and fibre in those nodes to shorten the copper. On new builds, for a given amount of capital, we can provide more total consumer benefit with 10 down and 800 kilobits per second service up on a 2,200 metre build than by building to 1,200 metres just to get that upload number to 1 megabit per second. ", "14689 Our choice to focus on providing enhanced download rather than upload is reflected in the map you released showing broadband coverage in Canada. You have commented on what appears to be a stark divide between Alberta and Saskatchewan. ", "14690 In response, we note that many Saskatchewan communities are classified as unserved solely due to the upload component of the current target. These communities have 640 or 800K upload speeds rather than 1 megabit per second. However, the majority of them have download speeds of 5 or even 10 megabits per second. Your own monitoring report shows that 88 percent of the Saskatchewan population can access download speeds of 5 megabits per second or more. ", "14691 Secondly, this map is as of the end of 2014, so it does not show any of the improvements made in 2015, including Saskatchewan deployments supported through the Connected Canadians program.", "14692 We have introduced, as an exhibit, the map of Saskatchewan prepared by ISED which shows improvements in coverage after the completion of approved programs in the province. As you can see, it gets much better. At the end of this program, based on our understanding of what will be delivered by our program and that of YourLink, the Saskatchewan coverage map will look much more like our neighbours.", "14693 MR. MELDRUM: The voice regime has been around in pretty much its current form since 2002 and continues to serve Canadians well.", "14694 Under this regime, Canadians in rural and high-cost areas as well as Canadians in urban areas are able to access reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality, as is required in the Act.", "14695 Some parties have argued for the elimination of the wireline voice subsidy or the re-direction of wireline voice subsidy funds into some form of broadband subsidy. We urge the Commission to reject those arguments.", "14696 Saskatchewan people continue to rely on wireline voice. Our latest data shows us that nearly 65 percent of all Saskatchewan 9-1-1 calls in 2015 originated from wireline telephones despite there being more wireless than wireline phones in the province.", "14697 Despite the \u201ccord-cutting\u201d of some Canadians, the most recent Communications Monitoring Report showed that nearly 80 percent still had landline voice services. In addition to affordability, reliability, and the near ubiquitous availability of wireline voice service, a number of Canadians simply do not wish to transition to alternative technologies at this time. ", "14698 For those customers in high-cost serving areas, including First Nations customers, that continue to rely on wireline voice, proposals to eliminate the local voice subsidy regime would substantially decrease affordability. For band E customers in Saskatchewan, rates would rise by over 50 percent, while band F customers would see increases of close to 33 percent. I mention First Nations customers because 59 of Saskatchewan\u2019s 70 First Nations are located in these two Bands, and 100 percent are located in high-cost serving areas. ", "14699 Forcing increases like this on customers, or forcing ILECs to provide service below cost would not be in keeping with the Act.", "14700 A time may come in which there are only a few technological hold-outs who must be confronted in some manner and the Commission must begin a process to address this. That time is not now, however.", "14701 And the beauty of this is that if we are wrong and cord-cutting suddenly sweeps the nation, the local voice fund will be self-eliminating. In any event, the fund is important enough to Canadians that now is not the time to eliminate it. ", "14702 Even before the time comes that Canadians do not require the voice regime, SaskTel is pursuing methods of providing the voice service over alternative technologies in order to operate more efficiently. To that end, we have supported the proposal of others in this proceeding to remove the requirements to provide access to alternate long distance providers and to provide access to dial-up internet from the basic service objective. ", "14703 MR. STYLES: Commissioners, we have listened carefully to your desire to help shape a national broadband strategy and to understand the role of various players and we have the following recommendations. ", "14704 Voice and broadband should continue to be treated as separate regulatory items with the current voice regime staying largely or completely intact.", "14705 The broadband regime should remain aspirational with the Commission setting a new target of 10/1, which provides a measure that you can reasonably expect to be achievable in the next five years. Progress toward this target will be largely achieved by reliance on market forces. Programs to address any remaining coverage gaps should be led by ISED, with targeted government funding programs addressing those few areas where market forces and developments in technology do not. ISED\u2019s Connecting Canadians program is an example of how effective this can be, and we would be happy to further discuss this with you.", "14706 Gaps in affordability are best addressed by government agencies tasked with addressing social issues. Gaps in adoption unrelated to affordability can be partially addressed through digital literacy programs and are, in any event, best addressed by government agencies.", "14707 With that I\u2019ll close, and await your questions.", "14708 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for your presentation. ", "14709 And a special welcome to you, Mr. Styles. When the Commission signals that it\u2019s undergoing a very important proceeding on the future of telecommunications in this country it\u2019s always good to see that the CEOs show up for the conversation. So we appreciate it, thank you.", "14710 I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner MacDonald to start us off.", "14711 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good afternoon. Just before we get into my questions I just wanted to make sure that I\u2019m accurately understanding the exhibit that you\u2019re putting in with us today.", "14712 So the expanded high-speed access, the area that you have identified in green, is that totally a result of the Connecting Canadians funding that\u2019s been provided?", "14713 MR. MELDRUM: Yes, that\u2019s right.", "14714 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And the areas shaded in green, will all residents in that area have access to the current target of 5 down and 1 up, or will there still be some individuals that have smaller upload speeds than 1 meg?", "14715 MR. MELDRUM: Yes, so we will have some customers that have less than 1 up. And there will be some people in far-flung places that will not be covered by the fixed wireless that gets you that kind of coverage.", "14716 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. But within that coverage area will everyone have the option of 5 down, 1 up?", "14717 MR. MELDRUM: That\u2019s our understanding. Now, the reason I hesitate a little bit is that a company called YourLink was successful with the Connecting Canadians application so it\u2019s in their hands to implement it. But according to Industry Canada, if they implement what they agreed to under the Connecting Canadians Program that\u2019s the coverage that will be there.", "14718 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Perfect, thank you for that.", "14719 MR. MELDRUM: I think Daryl has something to add.", "14720 MR. GODFREY: So I think it\u2019s important to note that those coverage areas are wireless technologies. So while it looks like it\u2019s full coverage, there certainly are people that live in valleys and things like that that may not, you know, get full coverage. But anybody who is addressable will get 5/1.", "14721 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I notice, in reviewing your original submission of July of last year and some of your comments today, there seems to be a softening in tone on some of the statements that were made almost a year ago so I\u2019m going to change my questions a little bit.", "14722 But I noted in your original intervention on page 6 you made the statement that many Canadians continue not to feel the need for broadband service, and that\u2019s a viewpoint that quite frankly I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve heard over the last couple of weeks of this hearing.", "14723 Can you explain that to me and how you came to that belief, or if your position has changed slightly what the reasons are?", "14724 MR. MELDRUM: Well, I think we\u2019re just acknowledging that there are some people that definitely have chosen not to become internet savvy. They do tend to be older folks as well as those that are economically challenged. But certainly the intention wasn\u2019t to downplay the importance of internet in today\u2019s society. Not at all.", "14725 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: With respect to your own customers, is it often that an end customer will purchase your service but elect not to buy either your internet or the internet of another service provider?", "14726 MS. WHITE: When a customer takes our internet service; is that your question?", "14727 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah.", "14728 MS. WHITE: Yeah. They tend to take our service and our other services as well, right, in terms of voice or TV. I\u2019m not sure if that answers your question.", "14729 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Well, if you\u2019re making the point that many Canadians choose not to avail themselves of internet service either for financial reasons or because they don\u2019t know how to use it. I\u2019m trying to figure out how large a cross-section of the population that actually is. So if you have, you know, if you have a 100 customers in a given community do five percent elect not to purchase internet; do 25 percent elect not to purchase internet?", "14730 MS. WHITE: I don\u2019t know that we have an exact number. You know, we\u2019d have to take that one back. I\u2019m not sure if anyone else can answer that one.", "14731 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah, if you want to take that offline and perhaps provide some clarity around that point for May the 5th that would be appreciated.", "14732 MR. MELDRUM: We can do that. ", "14733 ", "UNDERTAKING", "14734 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you. I'm looking at your website and I notice that you have a wide range of bandwidth options, and you note that many Canadians, or at least some of your customers, elect to purchase a service option below the 5-1 target. And I'm wondering, can you speak to how frequently that happens, how often a customer decides to choose a smaller package versus a package that meets the target, and what the rationale is for them making that decision? ", "14735 MS. WHITE: Right, so I'll start with the purchasing process. So when a customer is coming in to purchase an internet package from us we assess what package makes sense for them, based on their needs. You know, are they someone who is a light user and is looking to use their service for email and web browsing. Or are they someone who is looking to do a lot more streaming of movies? Are they a gamer, those types of things. So we sell the package based on the customer's needs. And from -- at that point, if a customer decides to upgrade or downgrade, it's based on their needs go forward and affordability. ", "14736 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Do you have any demographic information around the people that choose to make that decision? Is it -- do they tend to skew older versus younger, do they tend to skew more towards lower-income individuals?", "14737 MS. WHITE: Okay, so the individuals who purchase our lower-end packages typically tend to be in that more mature market segment and the individuals who are 65 or older or potentially are -- have less means; however, we do find that the majority of our customers take a package that is 5 megs or lower. ", "14738 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And is that number decreasing over time? The reason I spent six years on the board of directors for a nursing home, and I was always impressed by how, year over year, older people get more and more tech savvy, perhaps because that was the only way they could get a hold of their grandchildren. So I'm just wondering, do you see that changing over time? ", "14739 MS. WHITE: Absolutely, absolutely. There is definitely an increasing desire for, I think, everybody to participate in the digital economy, and that can translate into a desire for higher bandwidth, yeah, and higher packages. ", "14740 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. In your original submission you suggested removing the aspirational target of 1 meg up, and I'm just wondering, can you explain your thought process there? Is that a -- is that based on the technology you're using or based on the needs of your clients? ", "14741 MR. MELDRUM: I think at that stage we were fairly concerned about the 1 meg up issue because we do have a lot of customers that are just getting 800 or less than that, so that's why we sort of zeroed in on it. It will take a considerable investment for us to upgrade the 800 to even just the 1 meg upload, so that was why we were quite concerned about it. ", "14742 Interesting that I said under Connecting Canadians won't actually fund you to increase from 800 to a faster upload speed, and that makes sense, when you think about it. They're trying to ration their money and they're focusing on the download. So that was really -- I think the thrust of our submission was focusing on the download. That's what our customers look for when they're buying. ", "14743 There's certainly the exceptions of some small businesses if you're doing online publishing or that sort of thing where the upload is important, but the vast majority of our customers, it's the download that's the important piece. ", "14744 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So you did note that you have made significant investments in your network to deliver faster speeds and you note your roll out of fibre to service your customers. Given that you have taken that plunge to build fibre into at least some of the larger communities, you are also maintaining that people perhaps don\u2019t need the speeds that fibre offers. Was that decision more because the market was forcing you into it versus your belief in the requirements of the end users? ", "14745 MS. WHITE: So our desire to roll out a fibre network is multi-pronged. First off, it is to ensure that we are competitive with the other providers that are out there, that are offering higher speeds, because there are certain segments of the market who are interested in it, and we want to ensure that we are meeting their demands.", "14746 Putting in a fibre network also helps us from a cost perspective, as we look to retire some of the older technologies, as Gerald alluded to. ", "14747 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And when you roll out fibre to a specific city or a specific community, do you shut down your old -- your older technology, your older network, or does the copper stay up there on the poles or in the trenches? ", "14748 MR. GODFREY: My neighbour here and I have lots of debates about that. We would love to retire our copper network as quickly as possible. Our current program -- we install fibre and we convert all of our customers that have broadband or television services, but anybody that just has a telephone service only, we don\u2019t actually convert them. ", "14749 So at some point in the future, we certainly will, you know, make that plunge and convert the rest of them, but it's a fairly expensive thing to do, to convert a customer that's, you know, that's paying just for telephone service, but it will happen over time. ", "14750 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So that would be with respect to your existing customers. What about new customers? What about a new subdivision that's built in a community that has fibre access? Do you still run copper facilities or is it all fibre now? ", "14751 MR. GODFREY: It's complete fibre in the new subdivisions. Any greenfield build is 100 percent fibre. ", "14752 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. In 2001, the National Broadband Task Force submitted a proposal to government and 15 years ago they were calling for one and a half meg up, one and a half meg down symmetrical service, and expecting that over time, that would grow to between 4 and 6 megs, based on the needs of Canadian. And one of the individuals on that task force and that signed the report was your own president and CEO at the time. You are advocating slower upload speeds than even your CEO was 15 years ago. Why the change? Have you just not seen the needs grow as they originally anticipated?", "14753 MR. STYLES: This is really all about customers and what they're looking for. I think it's probably apparent to most people that the largest amount of the volume that companies such as (inaudible) these days is something from Netflix, for instance, YouTubes, these type of video organizations, video companies, and therefore, it's primarily a download that they're looking for. ", "14754 So to me, it's just a part of the evolution of what's happened in the market and the kind of services that are available today versus what was being -- I guess being forecast a number of years ago. ", "14755 I think this is the same challenge we face looking five years out. While we believe we can see that far, I think it's very tough to understand the kind of new applications, new services, that could be coming to the market, and really, you need to plan your networks with a lot of flexibility in mind. You will have to adjust in the future. Potentially, maybe it's faster download, maybe it's faster upload, but again, you need some flexibility in there.", "14756 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that. More and more Canadians are working from home now or running home-based businesses. How do you see their needs for speed changing in relation to the residential customer, and do you have any specialized products targeting that SoHo market? ", "14757 MR. STYLES: So the business side is very diverse. You know, we separate our business sector into really the top 10,000 companies that are in Saskatchewan. They're more what you'd think of for traditional businesses. They're a little larger in their size. Their demands are again quite different from what a small business might be. ", "14758 Those that are small businesses. Our experience to date has been they take mainly a consumer product, so if you're talking about a local barbershop, a hair salon, et cetera, consumer products seem to satisfy most of their needs. ", "14759 It's when you get to the larger companies, and with those larger companies they're looking for more and more bandwidth access and in some cases they're looking for something that is symmetrical. And so you need a different suite of products to be able to deal with those companies. ", "14760 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So understanding that some customers, large enterprise, the MUSH sector, for example, probably do need symmetrical service. Do you differentiate between your residential services and your small business packages? If I, Chris MacDonald, am running a home business, am I prohibited from buying a residential consumer package or am I forced to a more expensive business bundle? ", "14761 MR. STYLES: No, you're not. If your small business, you're working from home or, again, small business in a commercial building, you're welcome to take our consumer products as well.", "14762 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You recommend that whatever speed target comes out of this proceeding that it be an aspirational one. Do you think an aspirational target is as effective in getting to the end stages as a target that would be more firmly regulated?", "14763 MR. STYLES: In setting targets, the effectiveness of reaching the targets is largely dependent upon the policy options that you're going to choose. When it comes to broadband, it seems to me the government has already chosen -- the government proper has already chosen to use direct spending programs.", "14764 We're down that path, in effective, and it's worked out quite well for the first 5/1 aspirational target. We see no reason to change or move away from that particular policy decision going forward. Again, it's worked well to date, let's continue on that exact same path.", "14765 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So with respect to government funding or your own investment, where do you think the focus should be? Because we've heard some proposals that range from building fibre everywhere, to increasing the capacity of transport networks, to know before we do that, we need to focus on filling in the gaps to service those unserviced and underserviced Canadians.", "14766 Those are all important projects, but if you had to choose one, where does the focus need to be?", "14767 MR. STYLES: I think it's important that there be an overarching approach or an overarching strategy that considers an entire nation, an entire province and all of the different individuals that are there. And to be able to accomplish that, you need usually a variety of different approaches. You know, each location, each geography is quite a bit different.", "14768 And as an example of that, in Northern Saskatchewan, we're just in the process right now of completing a $30 million fibre build that is taking fibre from La Ronge all the way up to another location, Points North in Collins Bay. In that particular build, it was built around a partnership between three different companies, Cameco, SaskTel and SaskPower.", "14769 We've been able to complete that as a way to service the mines. That was the benefit that was coming from Cameco. As part of it, we also invited the Connecting Canadians program to join us in that particular endeavour and allow us to use that very large fibre build to also service some 30 other communities that are in the northern part of Saskatchewan.", "14770 And so what you have is, again, private sector funding, you have some additional provincial funding, provincial assets being drawn into it from SaskPower Corporation, and then you have federal funding that is being, you know, added to the mix as well to be able to accomplish this.", "14771 So you know, I tend to believe it's not a simple here is the simple policy approach or policy instrument that you want to use, but rather you need to look at a variety of different instruments to be able to accomplish the things that are important to meeting the objectives.", "14772 So I would say again, it's a variety of different policy mechanisms that allow you to be successful.", "14773 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: We heard from Xplornet a couple of weeks ago, and they're launching new services, I believe, by the end of next year that are going to allow them to provide 25 meg down, 1 meg up to residents from coast to coast to coast via their technology.", "14774 If we're on the cusp of being able to realize those speeds, do we need to continue to focus on government funding, or once that solution is in place does that fix the problem once and for all?", "14775 MR. STYLES: Xplornet is a -- Xplornet services are ones that are another part of the solution, we believe. They've effectively been able to service some areas in Saskatchewan that, for reasons of cost, we would not be able to service, and so we believe that they have a role.", "14776 There are challenges with satellite services, however, that for some customers, both business and residential, they find to be unacceptable. Data caps, throttling of speeds, weather conditions hamper the service, and latency has proven to be a big challenge for anybody who's trying to run a business, to run some sort of a situation where latency is problematic.", "14777 So you know, they have a role in all of this, and like all the other pieces, you know, they're important, I think, to achieving our objectives, but I don't believe they are the solution for rural areas in their entirety. They have limitations.", "14778 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You mentioned in your original intervention that what was Industry Canada, when they were handing out funding targeted towards the North that they provided funding to support a target below the 5/1 that's currently in place. And you've suggested here earlier today that perhaps solutions other than 1 meg up may be appropriate in some areas of your service territory.", "14779 So with that in mind, should there be one target across the country that we try and get everyone to, or do we need to look at targets that are more specific to the region in question?", "14780 MR. STYLES: So maybe I'll answer the very first part of that and then I'm going to ask our CTO maybe just to talk about the technology platform and network design aspects of it.", "14781 But you know, I think it's good to have one aspirational target for the entire nation. To me, that seems to be good public policy. But I also think that in setting a target you also need to be careful to understand that there are technologies that have limitations, and getting close to the target can be as effective or maybe more effective from a cost perspective than actually reaching the target.", "14782 And with that, maybe Daryl can just talk a little bit about the DSL technology platform and its limitations.", "14783 MR. GODFREY: Sure, I mean we use the same technology as all of the -- pretty much all of the telco's in Canada. So again, as I mentioned in my piece of the speech, was the loop lengths are what, you know, what matters in download and upload speeds.", "14784 So the download speeds, because it uses the vast majority of the spectrum available, is less affected by the loop lengths than upload. But upload, in order to get that 1 meg, you have to get down to, you know, 1.2 kilometre loops.", "14785 So in some small towns, we would basically be, you know, adding in three or four additional cabinets at $70,000 a piece plus fibre costs purely to get to that 1 meg number, when the reality is we can provide 5 or 10 meg down with, you know, those longer loop lengths. So that basically is the challenge, is just a lot more money with that technology to increase your upload speeds.", "14786 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Your neighbours from Alberta were in last week, and I'm thinking of Axia, and they were speaking about the supernet in Alberta. And one of their proposals was that we should adopt a similar type of strategy as to what they have. Focus on building fibre between communities, having an access point where a last mile provider can connect in to get the transport that they need.", "14787 And they were of the belief that market forces would prevail. If the transport was in place, there would be private industry or community networks or other groups that would be interested and willing to step up to provide the service to that individual community.", "14788 Can you comment on whether you think market forces in rural areas would be strong enough to make such a proposal viable?", "14789 MR. STYLES: So I -- one of the discussions and debates that I've seen at other hearings has always been what's rural. And what, for instance, the Province of Ontario would call rural, we would call that our larger cities. And so the same, I think, applies when you're talking about rural in Saskatchewan versus rural in Alberta.", "14790 You know, rural Alberta is much more densely populated than in Saskatchewan. Rural Alberta has, it did have, and I think it still has it, a much more vibrant business sector, non agricultural. And so you'll find things like processing potato plants, for instance, okay, that chip the potatoes, things like that, and the particular meat packing plants. You don't find that in Saskatchewan.", "14791 So the economic sort of background to rural communities in Saskatchewan is a little different than it would be in Alberta. And so in Alberta, something like supernet does seem to work quite well for them, but the individual communities have a corporate sector that can respond and can help fund that last mile solution.", "14792 In Saskatchewan, if you were to look at the same thing, there was very few communities that can do \u2013- communities -- for instance, the three that were just talked about a little earlier in our speech, their households are a hundred households or less. Those kind of communities don't have that economic power, they do not have the wealth necessary probably to put a last mile solution in place. ", "14793 We\u2019ve taken on a little different approach to this and so we\u2019ve developed something called a Community Participation Program. And where there\u2019s a community that\u2019s looking for service, maybe it\u2019s a 5/1, maybe it\u2019s a 10/1, doesn\u2019t have it today, we\u2019re willing to sit down with the community and look at the business case. And what we would expect from the community, for instance, is to fill in the gap, the economic gap.", "14794 It\u2019s proven to be quite successful. We\u2019ve built -- recently turned up four towers in the far north. Wolliston Lake, Black Lake, Stony Rapids and Fond-du-lac. And now these are communities that are pretty close to the Northwest Territories border. The Athabasca Basin Development Authority participated in this and provided funding, together with one of our vendors. And so we were able to make those towers work there.", "14795 In the south we\u2019ve done something similar in a number of different circumstances. A Rawlan condo just outside of Regina that we actually put copper into, they came back to us, weren\u2019t happy with speeds, et cetera. And so they completely funded a -- almost completely funded a fibre deployment. ", "14796 And so again, you know, I think you need -- again, one solution doesn\u2019t fit all in our country. You need many different solutions I think to be able to sole a variety of problems. But again, having one objective I believe is the correct thing to do. ", "14797 But you just need some flexibility to be able to make it work. And you need partnerships, many different types of partnerships with communities, with companies, other government agencies. ", "14798 We swap fibre, for instance, with SaskPower in Saskatchewan. And so between the two of us, we swapped fibre that has deferred capital expenditures of over $48 million. And again, it\u2019s a great solution. We swapped some fibre. We both saved money. It also gives us a much cheaper source of backhaul that allows us to meet the needs of communities throughout the province.", "14799 So again, I never believe that one solution fits everything. I think you need different solutions. And while I understand what happened in Alberta, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a model that necessarily would work well in Saskatchewan.", "14800 MR. MELDRUM: I think as well, if you zeroed in on the Axia proposal, it looks like there\u2019d be a lot of duplication of facilities. And in our province, we\u2019ve spent a lot of money taking fibre to some very, very small communities. So I just don\u2019t quite understand how you could take the SuperNet model and overlay it on an existing model with existing facilities unless nationalization is part of that proposal.", "14801 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: You\u2019ve structured some of these partnerships, as you just said, with smaller communities where they would fund a component of your business plan to make it viable. Why are some communities eager to make that investment and make that decision, in your mind, while others are not? Because we\u2019ve heard from both groups so far. Communities that have taken up the torch and invested in delivering broadband and we\u2019ve heard other communities that, despite being unserved, have not even considered the idea.", "14802 MR. STYLES: I would suggest it\u2019s tied to leadership. You know, does the community leadership have a vision? Do they see increased bandwidth having some degree of importance for their children, for their immediate community? ", "14803 Without naming the two, Rawlan Condo Associations, the one that was just outside of Regina, had a very strong set of leaders that mobilized all of the residents that were in that particular community. They approached the local RM. They got the RM to borrow the money. It\u2019s been put onto their tax bill and they\u2019re going to manage it over a period of time.", "14804 A similar Rawlan condo up in -- just outside of Saskatoon we\u2019ve kind of gone through this twice with them. They seem to get to the edge. They see there\u2019s a cost to it. And they decide to pull back from it. And so they\u2019ve gone to I believe a local fixed wireless provider in the area that is providing a much more limited product than what the group in -- outside of Regina was looking for.", "14805 So again, I think it\u2019s leadership. It might be the age of the individuals that are in the community. The one just outside of Regina was a very young group of families. And so they were very concerned that their children had much higher Internet access speeds plus, you know, potentially you\u2019re going to have multiple users in those households where in a more mature development, you know, you might only have one or two people actually trying to use the Internet access.", "14806 So to me, it\u2019s a combination of those things. But again, it comes back to leadership in those particular areas or particular communities.", "14807 We built a tower in partnership with a First Nation just outside of south end Saskatchewan, which is quite a ways north. Into that was the local health authority. I believe CAMICO contributed some dollars to it, a couple of other companies that were in the far north. And between that and ourselves, we were able to put up a tower for them and provide them for the first time wireless mobile service. ", "14808 And so again, each situation is a little different. You know, and again, I just think it\u2019s that local leadership.", "14809 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: When I was looking at your website I noticed -- and I believe it might actually apply to all of your Internet packages that you offer unlimited usage. And I\u2019m wondering, can you explain to me the rationale for why you decided to go with unlimited usage?", "14810 MS. WHITE: Unlimited usage gives us a different jitter within the marketplace.", "14811 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Okay. Because that\u2019s something we\u2019ve also heard, you know, we talk a lot about in this hearing, you know, about, you know, about the speed but it doesn\u2019t matter, you know, how big the pipe is if you blow through your data allowances in the first few days, then it\u2019s not as valuable to the customer. Should we be looking at mandating, I won\u2019t say unlimited usage, but at least minimal data allowances to ensure that customers can actually use the Internet for the full month?", "14812 MR. MELDRUM: So it\u2019s interesting that under the Connecting Canadians program, when you\u2019re successful, you have to agree that you won\u2019t have anything less than a 45 gigabit cap and you have to agree that you\u2019ll -- that that\u2019ll last for 5 years. So I said at least in these gaps, sort of the rural areas, has come to the conclusion that 45 is the right number.", "14813 It\u2019s hard to -- hard from our perspective to envisage where to go when we\u2019ve got basically the unlimited. Certainly in terms of future flexibility, that might present a problem. Because certainly there\u2019s a cost to having an unlimited packages.", "14814 MR. STYLES: I mean, I would throw it back to it\u2019s a marketplace. And what you want is you want many different types of plans. And you want to see many different prices in the marketplace so that different individuals, depending upon their needs, can select what makes best sense to them. We\u2019ve made that decision to go with unlimited and we\u2019ve also made the decision not to throttle our landline Internet. Our competitors do in Saskatchewan, but I would tell you, you know, that\u2019s been our decision. We think it gives us a competitive advantage. Obviously, my competition has a different view of that and believes they can make a better dollar by both throttling and by capping effectively.", "14815 So to me, it\u2019s a market issue and you should let the market dictate, you know, what\u2019s put in. And those that get a higher return obviously do better. They\u2019ll continue to provide what the market demands or what the customers demand out there.", "14816 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Without getting into specifics about your own network architecture, can you speak to what challenges in the terms of the backend infrastructure or capacity are created and need to be addressed when unlimited packages are put forward if ---", "14817 MR. GODFREY: Yes, I can. So we have a -- what we call our rural Ethernet or regional Ethernet transport network that traverses around Saskatchewan. That was put in a number of years ago with, you know, a previous version of technology. Typically you could do about a gigabit per second per fibre and then you can, you know, use course wave division multiplexing and have a, you know, a number of those. We\u2019re finding that\u2019s filling up now. So there is a -- there certainly is a cost when you\u2019re offering unlimited or just high speed Internet in general to a broad cross-section.", "14818 Also, all of our mobile services are now carried on the IP network. You know, if you went back to CDMA that was not on the Ethernet network, it was, you know, mostly voice and it was on a TDM network. But so now we\u2019re in the process of upgrading our regional Ethernet transport network with dense wave division multiplexing which will give you a 10 gig on a, you know, initially 10 gig on a fibre. You can do up to, you know, multiple 10 gigs on a fibre. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re having to go to now to carry all of that IP-based traffic around the province. It is costing us tens of millions of dollars to upgrade that.", "14819 So it\u2019s a challenge to find the capital to do that, but when that IP traffic continues to grow at that quick rate, we need to make that investment to support those services.", "14820 COMMISSIONER MACDONALD: Even though your packages are unlimited, do you monitor how much people actually use? Okay, yeah, it\u2019s an unlimited package but you\u2019re actually only using 100 gigs.", "14821 MR. STYLES: On the wireline side we don\u2019t.", "14822 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. ", "14823 MR. STYLES: On the wireless side we do. We have done some testing from time to time on the wireline side and we know the numbers are very, very large.", "14824 I could maybe use as an example we put out a fixed wireless system into rural Saskatchewan about two years ago now. We were interested to understand what that might look like in terms of usage. Average usage today by customers that are on that particular network is up to 68 gigs per month. We have customers on that network now that are into 100 and some gigs per month. ", "14825 And it tells you the difference between a broadband system or a broadband platform that is providing broadband as sort of a full service to somebody in their home versus broadband that you\u2019re talking about on a mobile system. So on a mobile system I think our data right now we\u2019re about 3 gigs a month, okay, for an average user. ", "14826 And so if you compare that between, you know, the mobile and the fixed there\u2019s no comparison. On the fixed side or even on the landline side the numbers you\u2019re talking about are very, very large in terms of the amount of data. And again, that to some extent explains a little bit about the type of services that they\u2019re accessing. A lot of it is video which, again, eats up huge amounts of data. ", "14827 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Just to move on to another topic.", "14828 Can you describe for me the day in the life of one of your frontline customer care reps? What are they hearing if someone is calling in for a complaint; what are people complaining about right now?", "14829 MS. WHITE: So what I will say is we do monitor our complaints and review them on a weekly basis. I\u2019m happy to share what those complaints are with you in an undertaking.", "14830 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, if you could do. Just, like the top three would be perfect.", "14831 MS. WHITE: Yeah.", "14832 ", "UNDERTAKING", "14833 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And I note that you don\u2019t make your customers sign contracts for residential internet services; is that correct?", "14834 MS. WHITE: Correct.", "14835 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Is there anything in the way of fair-use policy or terms and conditions or service levels that you set out at the time they subscribe to the service?", "14836 MR. MELDRUM: There are fair-use policies that are available in what we call our sort of our non-tariffs schedule. But they don\u2019t come into play to any agree at all these days in terms of dealing with customers. ", "14837 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Is that recorded somewhere? Like, do you have that in writing that you can also file with us as an undertaking?", "14838 MR. MELDRUM: Yes. The Saskatchewan Telecommunications Act actually has a provision in it that talks about this document, and it is a public document so it\u2019s available in all of our businesses offices. It is some of the same provisions that were around the tariff part but this includes forborne services. So yes, it is public and we can provide you the link to it.", "14839 ", "UNDERTAKING", "14840 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Perfect. ", "14841 A lot of people -- and we talked about speed, we talked about data usage. A lot of people are complaining that, you know, due to quality of service issues be it latency, be it jitter, what have you, that they\u2019re not able to access the applications that they would like to. So are those quality characteristics that we should be monitoring across the country?", "14842 MS. WHITE: In terms of the service obligation we don\u2019t believe that those should be included.", "14843 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And does that include everything from latency and jitter to mean time to repair anything with respect to the quality of the service that the customer enjoys or doesn\u2019t enjoy as the case may be?", "14844 MR. MELDRUM: Well, I think in terms of monitoring, understanding the issues, because certainly if something becomes a major problem I think the Commission will want to be on top of that and may have to take action. So yeah, I guess I would see it more of a monitoring aspect.", "14845 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Should that be reported upon by the Commission as well?", "14846 MR. MELDRUM: I think you\u2019d have to see where things are at today. I don\u2019t have a sense that there\u2019s a lot of concern about the quality of service with respect to broadband, certainly in our marketplace. When Katrine does the undertaking of the top things we\u2019re hearing from our customers, the quality of the internet doesn\u2019t appear at all.", "14847 MS. WHITE: Yeah, that\u2019s not within the top three. And I think it\u2019s important to note that over the last three years SaskTel has won highest in customer satisfaction for internet in the west. And they monitor five different components, and performance and quality are the top two.", "14848 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay, thank you.", "14849 We heard from a number of groups, AAC, we\u2019ve heard from ACORN, and various low-income individuals around costs and affordability issues. And I\u2019m just wondering, what does your company do to ensure the affordability of your products that service some of the lowest income Canadians? Do you have a special package or anything of that nature?", "14850 MS. WHITE: So the service options that we have for those who would be disadvantaged from an affordability perspective fall in line a little bit more on the wireless side. So we do have packages that are as low as $18 for individuals that potentially would be hearing impaired. We\u2019ve got data packages that start as low as $20. We have a special package for individuals who are paraplegic. We provide them with free access and 150 minutes on the wireless side. And on the wireline side for internet, the packages that we have available are the ones that you would see on our website and they are offered on an unlimited basis. ", "14851 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And when your sales reps are going through that sales process and sales conversation with an individual, do they take time to educate the customer about what they can expect between these different services so they can identify whether it\u2019s actually a light user, medium user, heavy user?", "14852 MS. WHITE: Yes.", "14853 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Rogers recently announced that they\u2019re expanding their Connected for Success Program, and when TELUS was in presenting to us later on they also indicated that they were moving down a similar route and were having conversations with various governments about providing their own package targeted towards low-income individuals. Do you have any thoughts on that? Is that an indicator that market forces are actually working to address the social need out there, and is there anything in the works from SaskTel\u2019s perspective with respect to similar initiatives?", "14854 MR. MELDRUM: So we\u2019re certainly interested in the programs that others have underway. It is not something that we currently have today. You know, as part of the provincial government, it\u2019s not really within our mandate to deal with that kind of social policy issue and albeit trying to tackle poverty. ", "14855 I know Ron has a perspective from his days at Saskatchewan Housing Corporation in terms of whether the owners of the facilities really want to limit their tenants to one provider or not, so it\u2019s always a hurdle to get over. But it is something that we might consider but it is at that line between sort of being the phone company and leaving the social policy aspects up to Sask Housing and the Department of Social Services. ", "14856 MR. STYLES: Yeah, I\u2019d probably be mainly repetitive of what John has just said. When you talk about low-income individuals, Rogers has targeted it to organizations that take care of the determination of somebody being in need. Those kind of relationships are ones, you know, I think we\u2019d be quite happy to have a look at. ", "14857 More broadly it\u2019s difficult to do because really we\u2019re not an organization that\u2019s in a position to try to target. We don\u2019t have the information about an actual individual, what their income is. You know, it\u2019s income and wealth as well. You\u2019ve got to be able to look at both of those criteria. ", "14858 But, you know, we\u2019re always working with the community. We try to find unique ways to make sure that we\u2019re able to provide our services, okay, to different groups of disadvantaged individuals that are out there. So we would always have a look at it.", "14859 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Do you currently do anything today to help service that market, provide complementary services into a community access centre that is frequented by low income or disadvantaged Canadians? Do you have any other programs sort of in that vein that you\u2019d like to make us aware of?", "14860 MR. STYLES: We do some things around a program -- it\u2019s been renamed, so I have to apologize for it, \u201cComputers for Schools\u201d, and so it\u2019s got a different name now too. It\u2019s been broadened out and I understand it\u2019s not just going to be schools, but new immigrants to Canada as well are going to be involved in it, so we\u2019ve been involved in those types of programs over a period of time. You know, we do work with agencies in the inner city areas in Regina as an example. North Central Community Association, we support them, provide them with a certain level of support and service okay, to assist in that particular area which is very low income.", "14861 So we have, you know, a variety of -- if I can use the phrase \u201cone-off community programs\u201d, but you know, they're more about sponsorships than they are what I would call a rate line.", "14862 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "14863 MR. MELDRUM: If I could just add something, because the cognitively disabled tend to be fairly forgotten at public hearings because they don\u2019t tend to be represented. We had a much smaller amount in our deferral account, and one of the things that the Commission approved for us was to work with Inclusion Regina to develop a program for cognitively disabled people to be able to learn how to use an iPad. It was extremely successful in terms of what it did for those people in terms of opening up their -- their world and their lines of communication. ", "14864 We\u2019re not funding it anymore, although we still sponsor Inclusion Regina, and are looking for volunteers within the corporation to assist with that program. But it was a huge success and it was great that the Commission approved our deferral accounts going to a group that -- that I think does get forgotten unfortunately.", "14865 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: To the best of your knowledge, and you may not have an answer to this question, but does the -- does the province of Saskatchewan do anything with respect to providing communication services or offsetting the costs of communication services for low income people living in the province? Does it form part of the calculation of cost of living?", "14866 MR. STYLES: So there's -- there's two different programs that are available to lower income individuals. There's a set of means\u2019 test to go with them obviously. The first is that telephone service is included in -- in the welfare calculations. And so that was decided, if I remember correctly, early part of the \u201890s, and so that is, you know, distinctly there. There's also a portion of the financial allocation each month, okay, this open up for the individual to use as they believe appropriate, so there's some discretion that are in there. ", "14867 In addition, the province launched a program I believe about 18 months, two years ago that has provided in fact -- and this is my phrase, please, I'm not sure if this is how they describe it -- but almost has provided a pension in a sense for individuals that are disadvantaged, in the past may have been on welfare but are unable to work. And so the province has taken a much different approach. I think it\u2019s very innovative here in Canada. So instead of having individuals that again that can't work that are the most disadvantaged maybe in our society and talking about them being on welfare, it's no longer the case, they're now on a different type of program. ", "14868 And again, it\u2019s similar to a pension, they're provided with funds on an ongoing basis, okay, to be able to live -- to be able to live in a -- in a manner that represents their disability. They do receive special funding as well, depending on their disability to try to account for cost that may be associated with that particular type of disability.", "14869 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Cogeco was here last week and one of the suggestions that they put forward was similar to the food stamp program down in the United States, that the government would come forward with a telecom stamps -- for want of a better term -- program, whereby low income individuals could use their stamps to offset their communications cost. Would you care to comment on that proposal or where the positives and negatives may lie with it?", "14870 MR. STYLES: So I\u2019m going to probably more comment from my past history working with the provincial government as involved in housing of Deputy Minister of Finance, et cetera, so I spent a fair bit of time around programs that are designed to redistribute the income and to support those that are less in need.", "14871 I would tell you -- or at least my suggestion would be that it\u2019s not a very effective way to create individual separate programs, okay, for each aspect of a person\u2019s affordability needs, that rather you need to be able to group them together, examine where there's overlaps between the programs, et cetera, okay, and treat individuals in a more comprehensive manner.", "14872 The province of Saskatchewan and I think other provinces have gotten away from individual programs that focus on individual aspects of what an individual\u2019s needs are. ", "14873 So I would tell you I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good way to go myself. My experience is that, you know, all you do is you create redundant programs, okay, with a lot of backend costs. The more times you have to collect information on a person\u2019s wealth and income, the more duplication you\u2019ve got going on. You're better to share that means\u2019 test in some way, shape or form, share the input process, share the case management for lower income families, and make sure that you're addressing all of their needs in a more comprehensive manner.", "14874 While we -- you know, as individuals we look at all the different components and we talk about them all being important, okay, or whatever phrase you\u2019d like to use, the reality is when people get these resources in a low income family, they priorize (sic) based upon their needs as well. You can try to break that down to a certain extent, but you know, you simply create a black market for whatever they don\u2019t want that they might want to shift to somebody else to get cash or whatever their -- their needs are. Housing, food, things like that become much more important than sort of other needs that might -- might come to the table.", "14875 So I would definitely tell you from my experience that\u2019s not -- not a very good route to go.", "14876 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And continuing to draw on your experience -- and your answer may be the same as the one you just gave -- but would you like to comment on the Affordability Access Coalition and PIAC\u2019s proposal of a fund being created ultimately paid for by the service providers and -- and their end customers on their bills to offset or provide a subsidy to low income Canadians, would you care to comment on that?", "14877 MR. STYLES: You know, we\u2019ve -- we\u2019ve watched with interest all the ideas that have come out over the past couple of weeks and you know, I think there's two different levels of affordability that are being talked about, they're quite separate. One is a level of affordability for your population, providing a product, a service that, you know, is affordable in a very general sense to all people in your population, and I believe that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done on the voice side. Because let me tell you, there are people in those high cost serving areas that probably don\u2019t need the subsidy. They are -- may be large farmers, there may be very large industries that are there and the people that are close to the industries, but they still get the subsidy, okay.", "14878 So again, what you're trying to do is I think balance the level of cost, okay, between, you know, all areas in your jurisdiction, and that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s the type of affordability that you're referring to and I think that\u2019s a very justifiable approach to it, it\u2019s a certain policy approach. When you talk about affordability for an individual, I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s quite different, okay. You\u2019ve got to be very careful that you can target your dollars. If you have a limited pool of dollars, and everybody\u2019s got limitations in this day and age, you want to make sure that the people that are getting the subsidy and the benefit, okay, are people that need it.", "14879 And so I think when you start to get to that level of affordability, you know, my belief is again you need to come back to some type of integrated approach. Separating your approach out for different types of products and services that individuals may need, okay, is not a very effective way to go about it. ", "14880 There's a couple of measures that economists are taught, vertical and horizontal target efficiency. It refers to what percentage your revenue is -- pardon me, what percentage of the dollars are actually reaching those in need, or what percentage of those in need are actually receiving dollars. And if you look at those two measures, okay, when you start to separate programs into little pieces, you start to degrade the efficiency of the programs. So I definitely would tell you I don\u2019t think that the right approach.", "14881 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Your support for wireline phone services is clear, and you believe that the funding provided for high-cost serving areas should continue, but we\u2019re also in a day and age where governments are forcing more and more individuals to self-service and obtain services over a broadband connection, and governments are receiving financial savings because of that. You know, even we heard from an individual I believe in Halifax with ACORN earlier in the proceeding that they couldn\u2019t even apply for a job unless they had access to broadband because a restaurant, or Tim Hortons, or what have you won\u2019t even take a paper copy of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 anymore. ", "14882 So given that fundamental shift, is it still fair to say that all critical services that people can need can still be accessed over a telephone?", "14883 MR. STYLES: You know, I think we\u2019re in a transition right now between, you know, an age where telephone and appearing at a, you know, company\u2019s door a business door was essential in a time probably where most everything might be on the internet and that will be the preferred approach to it. ", "14884 But today I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re there. I believe today that there is a variety of different program options, alternatives that are available to individuals to fill in some of those gaps. It\u2019s probably not perfect. But I can, as an example -- Northern and Aboriginal Affairs -- hopefully I got the right name there -- they have provided us with funding for instance to bring fibre to medical facilities, okay, that are on reserve, treatment facilities that are on reserve, schools that are on reserve. We hope shortly we\u2019ll be doing the same with band offices. And that starts to create locations where individuals can access the internet.", "14885 If you move, you know, to major cities, there is a lot of locations in major cities right now where you can go access the internet or you can access Wi-Fi. So there are options, there are alternatives that are available to people that, you know, I think still provides them with an opportunity to interface without necessarily having to go onto broadband. But it is becoming more important over time, and governments are going to have to continue to respond to that.", "14886 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just one final point before I move on to another area.", "14887 We heard from an individual last week, he was visually impaired. And he expressed frustration with both the packages that he\u2019s able to receive -- and thank you, you noted some of the additional services you offer for people with disabilities. Can you speak to how your staff are trained when it comes to dealing with visually impaired, cognitively impaired, or various other disability groups? Is there a centre of excellence for managing those customers within the company?", "14888 MS. WHITE: Yeah. So we do maintain a list of employees who have special skills from a language perspective, including ASL, and we engage those individuals as required as it relates to specific customers.", "14889 We also have a Special Needs Manager on staff as well who is able to support our customer service reps in any interactions with customers with special needs.", "14890 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Moving on to funding. You\u2019ve mentioned various different funding from different departments or provincial and federal governments over the years. SaskTel has received some of this funding; is that correct?", "14891 MR. STYLES: Yes.", "14892 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Would you be able to, as an undertaking, file a list of all of the programs that you\u2019ve been able to access? What the amounts are, and how those funds have been directed and to where?", "14893 MR. STYLES: Certainly. Starting all the way back to 2001?", "14894 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: That would be perfect.", "14895 ", "UNDERTAKING", "14896 So since you do have experience with these various funding mechanisms, are there any best practices that you would take away from those programs? Because we see from the federal government there\u2019s another $500 million in the budget. What are the dos and don\u2019ts with respect to some of these programs?", "14897 MR. MELDRUM: Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. We haven\u2019t always been successful with our applications. Certainly it starts with communication to fully understand the program and what they\u2019re looking for. ", "14898 With the most recent one, they begin with maps that show the unserved and underserved people. And we did a lot of work, and it\u2019s actually within our regulatory department, trying to understand the maps and the sources of their information. So that\u2019s sort of -- I think a best practice is to understand sort of the lay of the land as the funding body sees it, and then you can go from there. If you have an agreed upon current state then you can get your application to match sort of what it is that the funder is looking for.", "14899 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And should that all be done with a neutral approach to the technology being used? Okay, the government has identified who is unserved or underserved?", "14900 MR. MELDRUM: That\u2019s certainly how we\u2019ve approached it. I think that\u2019s how they look at it as well. There\u2019s probably a bias for wireline facilities just because wireline facilities seem to have the greatest future capabilities, you know, with additional investments. They tend to be reasonably future proof.", "14901 I don\u2019t know, Daryl, if you want to add anything?", "14902 MR. GODFREY: No, I think that\u2019s correct where wireline -- certainly seems to be better, wireless. They both continue to improve over time and the capacities of both increase, but wireline continues to maintain that lead and seems to have, you know, much more unlimited capacity at the end of the day.", "14903 MR. MELDRUM: I\u2019m just checking to see if -- Bill Beckman is in our regulatory group; he has been working closely with Connecting Canadians. And in fact, we\u2019re going to be seeing them later on this afternoon to update them on our program and to discuss the additional monies that have been allocated to them as well at what\u2019s unspent if we gather from the past.", "14904 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. ", "14905 If a service provider does receive funding through one of these government programs it\u2019s public money. So I ask, should that provider that benefited from the funding have an obligation to serve every resident of that funding geography?", "14906 MR. MELDRUM: I think that\u2019s certainly ISED\u2019s expectation. I guess the issue is that, if you think about the fixed wireless, there will be people because of where they are that just are not able to get the signal properly, whether they\u2019re on the fringe or in an area that the line of sight doesn\u2019t work because fixed wireless is really looking for a line of sight. ", "14907 So I don\u2019t know how you balance that in a wireless component. But certainly when we\u2019re getting money to provide internet service in northern Saskatchewan for the three communities that have never had it before, their expectation is that we will be providing service to everybody within that certain area. Now again, if you\u2019re living on the outskirts of that small village or hamlet, well, then you start to run into technological limitations.", "14908 Daryl, you wanted to add?", "14909 MR. GODFREY: You might add to that too there\u2019s capacity limitations as well. So with our, you know, our fixed wireless service, in order to make sure that the people are getting what they, you know, what we\u2019ve committed to, the 5/1 service, we limit the number of customers on any given tower. Because if we had, you know, unlimited number of people on that tower then they wouldn\u2019t get 5/1 anymore because it\u2019s a shared resource, right? ", "14910 So, you know, once it fills up then we have to make another decision on what do we do about it. Is there another tower nearby we can use to offload that one or, you know, is there more spectrum available? But, you know, typically there\u2019s not more spectrum available so that\u2019s one of the challenges with a fixed wireless service.", "14911 So the proposal itself does get at that, right? Because it has to describe how it is that we\u2019re going to turn this from an unserved or underserved area into a served area and they then assess it. ", "14912 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So if that is with respect to the service to the homes that are currently in a geography that you\u2019ve been provided funding for what happens in the future when someone builds a house, you know, five kilometres further down the road from the last house where there wouldn\u2019t have been any service? Perhaps they built knowing that there was no service in that area. Should the obligation to serve be extended to that new residence or just a snapshot in time when the funding was provided?", "14913 MR. MELDRUM: I\u2019d say it\u2019s a snapshot in time.", "14914 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. ", "14915 MR. MELDRUM: And the extent to which they\u2019re outside of the economic reach of the facilities then there\u2019s still satellite. Satellite certainly has a role in dealing with those people that are on the fringes.", "14916 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. ", "14917 Just a couple more questions before I hand you back over to my colleagues. You\u2019ve suggested that there should be a separate framework and separate funding mechanism put in place for -- definitely maintain the funding mechanism for delivery of voice services in high-cost serving areas, but then there should be a separate regime, separate framework put in place if we do go down the road of funding broadband. ", "14918 Can you explain to me why those two should be separate when we\u2019re in a day and age where both voice and broadband can be delivered over the same connection?", "14919 MR. MELDRUM: Well, if you think of broadband, there are many different providers of the service with many different technologies. So to throw that into the mix, today on the voice side, just about all of the high-cost serving areas are served by the incumbent phone companies so it\u2019s very clear who qualifies, whether or not they\u2019ve met the BSO. But the broadband is a whole -- another kettle of fish in terms of many different providers and many different technologies, so we think that if there is to be a fund around broadband that it should be separate; that to just build on the voice, in our opinion, doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense because of those reasons. ", "14920 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And just one final, and you spoke earlier about working with various different government bodies and funding sources to deliver broadband in northern Saskatchewan, I believe it was the $35 million fibre build that you\u2019re doing. So you have some experience in trying to bring these organizations together and leverage investments from both in a spirit of cooperation to get the job done and deliver service.", "14921 So given that we don\u2019t really have a broadband strategy in this country, how do we get people to the table and who should be at the table to develop such a strategy to ensure that we\u2019re not doubling up on investment; that we are investing in the right technologies, that we are taking in a holistic approach to delivering service to Canadians? ", "14922 MR. STYLES: For it to be a national strategy, it\u2019s -- obviously you\u2019re going to need the federal government, first and foremost, at the table. I think they have to provide that leadership, if I can use that phrase, to look at it nationally. You\u2019re going to need the telcos, the cable companies; you\u2019re going to need the providers there as well. You know, how deep you go with that; there\u2019s a lot of providers in Canada, and again, the larger you make the group that\u2019s involved, sometimes the more difficult it is to actually arrive at conclusions, consensus, and all the rest of it. ", "14923 But you obviously need the industry there as well. I think there\u2019s potentially some sort of role for the provinces as well. You know, what that would look like and who we would interface with, haven\u2019t given that much thought. But I think there\u2019s a bit of a role there for the provinces as well. Some of the provinces fund some of these projects to a certain extent. I\u2019ve seen recently where both Newfoundland and I think it\u2019s B.C. have provided funding directly and have some, you know, sort of direct involvement in it. ", "14924 Saskatchewan is a little different. The provincial government\u2019s involvement is obviously through us and I think we can probably represent both. ", "14925 You know, there\u2019s probably some stakeholder groups that are out there as well that I think would provide a little different perspective, balance off needs, et cetera, okay? I\u2019m sure you\u2019d find that First Nations would probably want a seat at the table as well. First Nations are probably the locations where there is the most underserved population in Canada so I think you\u2019d probably want to bring them to the table. ", "14926 I don\u2019t think you\u2019d have trouble getting people to join and to look at and discuss it, et cetera. You know, some of the challenges, I think, would be around the mechanisms, the policies and the programs that you\u2019re -- you know, that you\u2019re looking at trying to put into place. There would be many, many different views as you\u2019re probably experiencing here. ", "14927 But I don\u2019t think it would take much to bring people to the table and to talk about it and to try to serve something that is in the best interests of Canada. My experience in the industry is that most of the companies, all the companies, okay, you know, really understand that they\u2019re a major contributor to Canada\u2019s growth, both from an economic perspective, okay, and in terms of the quality of life in Canada. And I think they take a lot of pride in that and I think they\u2019d be quite happy to work with whoever from the -- whoever was putting that together. ", "14928 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that, and those are my questions. ", "14929 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "14930 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. ", "14931 Just a couple quick questions.", "14932 I want to just ask about transport. There\u2019s been some discussion about how discoverable the transport network across the nation is, and some discussion as to whether or not the Commission could play a role in making information about that network more available to folks who want to connect.", "14933 Do you have any concerns with making information related to the transport network available; publicly available or otherwise?", "14934 MR. MELDRUM: I think if you\u2019re talking about service between two locations, we don\u2019t have an issue with that. If you\u2019re talking about maps and laying out facilities in a public way, we wouldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be very happy with that, just given the world we live in today. I\u2019m not thinking about competitors but those that might want to sabotage something. ", "14935 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm. ", "14936 MR. MELDRUM: But to say that we have facilities between Tisdale and Melford, we don\u2019t have a problem with that. ", "14937 And in terms of our marketplace, we\u2019ve never heard that as an issue; that people wouldn\u2019t know to get a hold of us and deal with our carrier services group to find out what\u2019s available. ", "14938 In fact, just looking at our Web site you could probably figure out where we have fibre to, just based upon what it is that we\u2019re offering service there. ", "14939 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Well, fair enough. I think folks would know pretty well that you have the backbone. I mean, it began with community net and it\u2019s built and now it sounds like there\u2019s some sharing with Sask Power and so on. But not in Saskatchewan particularly was it brought up but there has been discussion about competitive ISPs or new players seeking to find access to transport. So no problems as long as we don\u2019t -- yeah. ", "14940 And I understand clearly your issue. I mean, we don\u2019t want to lay out for the world where all our critical infrastructure is.", "14941 So the other issue I wanted to discuss with you because you dealt with many issues with Commissioner MacDonald, you dealt with affordability, availability, but you didn\u2019t talk about literacy, and I was a little bit surprised about the position that you took on literacy which was, \u201cIt\u2019s best left to others.\u201d", "14942 So maybe could you explain to me why your positon is that it is best left to others to -- or other government agencies to address literacy, given the important role of an ISP as it relates to use of the internet?", "14943 MR. STYLES: You know what, I think we do things that are comparable to most other companies; we offer training courses, for instance -- training sessions, for instance, in our stores and so if somebody buying our product wants to come in and work with our staff to understand how to use a cell phone, et cetera, you know, we provide that. ", "14944 We reach out to schools, we have partner schools in Regina, Saskatoon, places like that, and we work with them. We also work with some of the technical institutes, okay? And, again, you know, it\u2019s about working together. We worked with one in Yorkton, for example. So we do a fair bit of that.", "14945 But in the end, digital literacy, I believe, is necessary in this day and age for almost our entire population, you know. They need to learn about it, especially young people that are coming up, because there\u2019s a generational change going on, as I believe Commissioner MacDonald had mentioned. ", "14946 You know, to that extent it\u2019s the educational facilities. It\u2019s the schools, primary, high school; it\u2019s the universities, the Polytechnic in Saskatchewan. They\u2019re the ones who are best positioned, I think, to hit the broadest audience possible. We work with them. I know Darrell here to my left, okay, works with the engineering faculties in Regina and Saskatoon both, and we participate with them and provide them with assistance. We recently worked with one of our vendors to put a -- it\u2019s called a lamp site -- a lamp site architecture in place at the University of Regina, and it was done in conjunction with the engineering faculty there and my staff have worked with that faculty on the management and monitoring of that particular equipment. ", "14947 And so you know, I think we have a role in it but, again, you know, a telco\u2019s reach is basically to our customer base. A pretty limited number of individuals, in the big scheme of things, in a province like Saskatchewan. I think you want organizations and groups that have a much broader reach to be the primary providers of it and probably provide it in a way that isn\u2019t biased towards SaskTel, okay? That rather gives them what they need to be able to survive in society as it is today.", "14948 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So I understand what you said, but I'm going to challenge you like I challenged TELUS. As we look at all the issues related to broadband, it's become clear that without strong champions, all areas of this, be it availability, be it affordability, be it adoption, they need strong champions. ", "14949 And if there's one area where the commercial ISPs have sort of a benefit, they could benefit as well as do their corporate social responsibility, it would appear to be on literacy. And you put out some great examples within the educational system, but there's seniors and there's other groups that have neither adopted or not -- potentially, even if they have adopted, perhaps haven't become literate as to the issues around security, privacy, and proper use, if you will. ", "14950 And it seems to me that if there is a place where, as I said, you know, commercial ISPs can play a strong leadership role, perhaps it is in literacy, as if nothing else, a corporate social responsibility. So I'd just like your sense on would it make sense in this whole thing, if we're looking for champions, that perhaps that is something, in fact, that the ISPs could step up to? ", "14951 MR. STYLES: I think the idea of being a champion is the right idea, okay? I mean, I think we have a leadership obligation, if I can use that phrase, you know, to champion these kind of issues, to be able to communicate them in many different ways, you know, not just to meeting with particular groups to train them, okay. but you know, in terms of broad mass communication, you know, radio, TV, things like that. And we do a fair bit of that; we try to make sure the public is aware of a variety of issues. We do PSAs, for instance, okay, when there are phishing attacks going on in Saskatchewan, okay, and so we try to educate people about phishing attacks. ", "14952 So we do a lot of that. It's just, I believe, that our reach is relatively limited. Working with others, especially where we're owned by the Province of Saskatchewan, the Government of Saskatchewan, working with others that are Saskatchewan Government institutions I think makes us a lot more effective. ", "14953 And so for instance, if we were to do something for seniors in seniors' social housing in Saskatchewan -- and there's a lot of units in Saskatchewan -- you know, I think our tendency, we'd be -- try to work with the Saskatchewan Housing Corporation, partner with them, and have our staff work with theirs to go into seniors' buildings, okay, to explain to them using landline services, landline broadline -- broadband, pardon me, and landlines. ", "14954 So yeah, I mean, I think we do have a responsibility. I think it's more in the execution. Again, I think if you work with others and partner, I think you can have a much broader impact than if you do it on your own. ", "14955 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes, thanks, and I wasn\u2019t suggesting that you execute everything on your own. I was just looking for where might be those champions. ", "14956 MR. STYLES: Yeah. ", "14957 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you, that was my question. ", "14958 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just a few quick final questions. I've asked this of others who've gone through recent provincial elections, and of course, we can't listen to every broadcast and radio broadcast in this country, so I was wondering to what extent was broadband, whether from a deployment perspective or other perspective, an issue in your recent provincial election?", "14959 MR. STYLES: It essentially was a non-issue in the election. I think it came up on two occasions, based on what -- you know, I was following it quite carefully. It came up on a couple of occasions. We've had a small congestion problem up in the -- along the Manitoba border, and that's one of the things we're going to solve with our fibre build up there, and then we're going to rebuild our radio network. ", "14960 So it came up in a debate between some of the candidates there, and in one of the agricultural debates. You know, farmers are looking for more coverage and so it came up in that particular debate as well. But other than that, it basically didn\u2019t sort of raise its head. ", "14961 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. Now, earlier you talked about the work you've been doing with people with cognitive disability. Is that the Inclusion Regina group? ", "14962 MR. STYLES: Yes. ", "14963 THE CHAIRPERSON: And you -- and I've heard good -- and you repeated here that it did great work. Now, that was funded through the deferral account? ", "14964 MR. STYLES: That's right. ", "14965 THE CHAIRPERSON: Is SaskTel intending to continue to support that initiative? ", "14966 MR. MELDRUM: So we're not providing direct financial support to the initiative that's called \"Let's Connect\", but we do sponsor Inclusion Regina, and it is continuing. ", "14967 THE CHAIRPERSON: Even though the deferral account may have been depleted? ", "14968 MR. MELDRUM: Yes. I think they saw the value in it and whether they're -- between our sponsorship and other government funding, they're able to keep it going. I'm just not quite fully aware of the situation. And we are looking for volunteers to assist them with the program. ", "14969 THE CHAIRPERSON: Of course. That's good, thank you. ", "14970 Earlier when we were talking -- Commissioner MacDonald was asking a question about speeds, particularly upload speed, I seemed to hear you say that, you know, the ISED target made sense because it was rationalized by the amount of money available. I was a bit taken aback by that answer, because if that sort of approach flowed normally in any government program, we'd choose to put less asphalt down on roads to cover the front of more people's -- voters\u2019 residences. In other words, we don\u2019t build substandard to cover more people; we find the correct standard and then we find the money. ", "14971 MR. MELDRUM: So it was in the context of the fact that they would not fund a program just simply to increase upload speed. So as we work to them to understand what they would fund in the province of Saskatchewan, we had the locations that just had the 800 or less upload speed. And while their target is 5-1, they wouldn't fund us to take a community from 800 kilobits up to 1 meg. ", "14972 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "14973 MR. MELDRUM: And the reason I said that made sense is because download is so much more important. They only had a certain size of -- bucket of money --- ", "14974 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, that's precisely --- ", "14975 MR. MELDRUM: --- so they're focusing on download first.", "14976 THE CHAIRPERSON: That's precisely my point. If we, in this conversation that's been quite extensive, come to the conclusion that the standard ought to cover both upload and download, we're not a government program in the same sense; we would create the standard regardless and so I was surprised that your answer was, \"We may.\" ", "14977 Although uploads -- although downloads may be more important to upload, it doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn't be concerned about the right standards. For instance, the agricultural community in your province might actually need higher upload speeds, or the creative community may need higher upload speeds because of the capacity required. So why would you not be concerned about the right upload speeds? ", "14978 MR. MELDRUM: Well, certainly aspirationally, we agree with the 1, and in terms of when we built the things we are building under the Connecting Canadians Program is being built to 1, but it's really in the context of --- ", "14979 THE CHAIRPERSON: But why not above 1 for the upload? ", "14980 MR. MELDRUM: Well, for us it's a pile of money, so I guess if a pile of money comes with --- ", "14981 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm not talking about you necessarily. I'm talking what the right standard is. I mean, if you -- we should be assessing first and foremost what the requirements are for a digital economy and participation from a democratic, cultural, social, and economic perspective. We shouldn't be just saying, \"There's not enough money; therefore, we won't do it.\" We should actually be first defining what the needs are, shouldn't we? ", "14982 MR. MELDRUM: And there are some needs for upload, but if we look at our customers and what they're buying and what they're using, the predominant issue is not upload. Now, aspirationally, we agree with 10-1, but I don\u2019t think we're suggesting that the 1 should go higher. I don\u2019t --- ", "14983 THE CHAIRPERSON: Even aspirationally? An aspiration doesn\u2019t cost money, does it, and others who've participated in this hearing have actually said that we have to think about upload as being equally important in the dialogue that these networks provide. ", "14984 MR. STYLES: So maybe I'd take a little different approach to this, okay? I think the point we were trying to get across is that the program itself valued bringing somebody who was completely unserved to some level of service, 5-1 being the standard, okay, more than it valued bringing somebody from 800 kilobytes up to 1 megabit per second. ", "14985 Not that they shouldn't come up to 1 megabit per second, but it's just when they valued those alternative uses of the available funds, they valued bringing somebody who had no service, okay, or maybe 1.5 megabits per second, all the way to 5 to 1, rather than bringing somebody who has 5 down and 800 kilobytes up to 5 and 1. And I think that was the point we were trying to get across, okay? ", "14986 And to me, that's just a prioritization of funding. The standards, we agree with the standards wholeheartedly, but it was the prioritization of the funding. You've got limited resources, more projects than you have money, so which projects do you, you know, do you allocate that to? ", "14987 I do want to comment on one thing you said right at the very start, because I really believe wholeheartedly in it. One of the things I think has been a challenge with the government programs that I've seen. So I've got a limited window. I haven't been with SaskTel for as long as some of the others here at the table, okay.", "14988 But one of my observations is when they look at the standard they only look at the standard. My view would be when they are selecting proposals and technologies; they should be looking at those proposals and technologies with respect to future path for growth, because if you put in a technology that'll only get you to 5/1 and won't get you beyond that, boy it's got a limited shelf life.", "14989 You should have to demonstrate that that technology has a growth path. It can go to 10/1, you know, 20/23. It should have a growth path, and if it doesn't, I'm not sure it's a great place to be allocating money and I think that has been a mistake in the past, okay.", "14990 THE CHAIRPERSON: And would you be of the view that the growth path includes upload speeds?", "14991 MR. STYLES: Sure, both upload and download.", "14992 THE CHAIRPERSON: What is your -- with the deployment of VRS later this fall, are you concerned at all, as some have come to this hearing to raise, that perhaps that the VRS speed -- upload speed may not be sufficient, the 5 -- the 1, actually, would not be sufficient to meet the VRS requirements?", "14993 MR. MELDRUM: So our position is that it will be sufficient. We understand that they talk about a 5 in 1.3, I believe, to get ultra -- sorry, the best resolution on that service, but we do believe, as Mr. Daniels from Bell said last week, that 5/1 or less has been working in the States for a number of years and it will continue to work and that 5/1 will be sufficient for VRS.", "14994 THE CHAIRPERSON: When your colleagues from Manitoba -- thank you. When your colleagues from Manitoba appeared, I asked them some questions about the EKOS table, number 2.1.2, and this is a table in the study that deals with rates of dissatisfaction.", "14995 Whether fortunately or unfortunately, I think the sample size means that you're bundled up with Manitoba, and you'll see that, from that table, that in terms of this is wired dissatisfaction is the first case. In that category, whilst the reliability assessment is that there's 16 percent dissatisfied nationally, for the combined provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the dissatisfaction is 19. With respect to speed, the national dissatisfaction is 19, but in the combined territories of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, it's 23.", "14996 Do you have any views on that? Is it all Manitoba's fault?", "14997 MR. MELDRUM: I was going to suggest you probably hear that from everybody, that they're not pulling down the results.", "14998 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, actually, Manitoba said that they can do better.", "14999 MR. MELDRUM: So we don't think we're pulling down the results but Katrine can expand on that.", "15000 MS. WHITE: Yeah, I think I've already mentioned, we do monitor our customer satisfaction with the Internet very closely, and the results that we -- that you refer to in terms of reliability and speed we don't believe that were representative in that survey.", "15001 So whether it's -- Manitoba is skewing it or there's -- they're talking to customers with other providers, just based on what we're hearing from our customers and the fact that, I mentioned before, in terms -- yeah, I don't think we'd be winning J. D. Powers three years in a row if our reliability was poor and our speed was poor or performance.", "15002 THE CHAIRPERSON: Now, with respect to price, you -- that -- those two territories have matched up with the national dissatisfaction of 48 percent. Do you find that a surprising result? That's nearly half the people in Saskatchewan and Manitoba are unhappy in this representative sample. This is not the open sample. The representative sample ---", "15003 MS. WHITE: M'hm.", "15004 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- with the price of wired Internet.", "15005 MS. WHITE: I think you can look at it two different ways. I think that if we look at it strictly from a factual perspective in terms of what options are out there for customers and the price points that -- their price points and how we compare, I think that we line up very well and very closely. So from a competitive perspective, I think there's a non issue there.", "15006 But in terms of would customers like to pay less for the service from us, I anticipate that most folks would indicate that they would like to pay less for a service.", "15007 THE CHAIRPERSON: One could argue that it's actually quite surprising in view of the fact that you offer an unlimited offering -- and we know that unlimited has more to do with price these days than network management -- that you would, nevertheless, on average, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, be lockstep with the national average. Where the rest of the country, and certainly important parts of the country have caps that create a bit of consumer frustration.", "15008 MS. WHITE: M'hm. Well, I agree with you wholeheartedly. Yeah, I think that the unlimited provides a lot more value and it's surprising that that wouldn't come out within the survey.", "15009 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm not an expert in engineering, telecommunications, so could you help me understand when you deploy wireless solutions, whether fixed or mobile, to what extent when you decide, for instance, to deploy some mobile wireless, to what extent that that -- does that flow back on your decision to deploy or not a fixed wireless in a given area?", "15010 MR. GODFREY: So they're kind of independent decisions, I guess, right. So our mobile network, we work very closely with our marketing department. They define to us where, you know, where they would like to have coverage. We then do a business case to figure out if it's economically viable to do it, and we will expand, you know, coverage where it makes sense economically.", "15011 From the fixed side, we did a project a number of years ago to provide the original fixed wireless product, and then when it ran out of gas and was obsolete and we had to replace it, we chose a newer technology to replace it with. And we now basically will choose to expand that again where it becomes economically viable.", "15012 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, but it's almost an independent analysis? They don't cross -- not cross upside, but they don't cross inform to each other?", "15013 MR. GODFREY: Not particularly, I don't believe.", "15014 THE CHAIRPERSON: All right.", "15015 MR. GODFREY: No.", "15016 THE CHAIRPERSON: Fair enough.", "15017 I believe those are all our questions. Yes, it appears so. So thank you very much.", "15018 And we will adjourn until 1:45. Thank you.", "15019 --- Upon recessing at 12:45 p.m./La s\u00e9ance est suspendue \u00e0 12h45", "15020 --- Upon resuming at 1:47 p.m./La s\u00e9ance est reprise \u00e0 13h45", "15021 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: \u00c0 l'ordre s'il vous pla\u00eet.", "15022 Order please.", "15024 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "15025 We will now hear the presentation of Mr. Michel Gammon. You may begin your presentation. You have five minutes.", "PRESENTATION", "15026 MR. GAMMON: Thank you, and thank you for this opportunity to speak.", "15027 My name is Michel Gammon, and I am a retired IT analyst. I used to work in healthcare IT. I live in lac Rond, Quebec, so a rural area in Quebec.", "15028 When I received confirmation that I could participate in these hearings, I was told I could present my submission by Skype. The irony wasn't lost on me. In fact, I cannot reliably use Skype because of frequent interruptions and lost connections on account of the Xplornet service that I have, largely due to the latency no doubt.", "15029 You might think from these comments that I live in some faraway backwater in the high Arctic, but the reality is I live less than 100 kilometres, as the crow flies, from Montreal, a city of three million. I also live about 30 kilometres from Granby, a city of 62,000; and 10 kilometres from Cowansville, a city of 12,000; and 20 kilometres from the U.S. Border. It's hardly a backwater, but I'm what is known as last mile Internet.", "15030 It is extremely frustrating to live 10 kilometres from true high speed Internet. We live on a dirt road that is also a high through truck route. The road is 2.3 kilometres long and there are six homes on that road, five of which are occupied year round by families.", "15031 For the record, we moved to the area in 1987, well before Internet was widely available to the public. It's now become essential for work, education, and entertainment. And over the years, we've attempted, using dialup, first generation of Xplornet satellite through a local fixed wireless provider, a Bell cellular modem, and now we're back in the latest generation of Xplornet satellite.", "15032 Nominally, I'm paying $107 per month to get 10 down and 1 up with a 50 gigabyte absolute data cap. The reality is on peak times I'm seeing 22 percent of the download and only 50 percent of the upload speeds on average. It's a bit better at off-peak times. I'm seeing 92 percent and still less than 50 percent up for an advertised speed of 10.", "15033 I have never seen the advertised upload speed and at peak periods the download speed can be as low as eight percent of advertised. That\u2019s only one order of magnitude faster than dial-up. ", "15034 This would suggest to me that the satellite is oversold and cannot meet peak demand. Latency times are long. We\u2019re talking almost a second so 700 to 800 milliseconds. ", "15035 And moreover, Xplornet\u2019s Fair Access Policy throttles internet back to dial-up speeds when it senses what is considered excessive usage based on some nebulous and unfathomable formula that we just don\u2019t know. To be fair, at least now the service is fairly reliable. There are a few dropped connections and those that occur tend to be brief. ", "15036 But getting back, 10 kilometres away, basically the same speed as I\u2019m getting now nominally, 10 kilometres away is less than half the price. And to get the speed, the best speed 10 kilometres away is 120 down 10 up, and 300 gigabytes data cap is still less expensive that I\u2019m paying now at 98.82, so for the same price 10 times the speed and six times the bandwidth, or for roughly half the price the same nominal capacity.", "15037 The impact of this is knowledge workers cannot reliably work from home. I\u2019m retired now though I do some part-time work as a translator, and I use many online tools for my work and working in peak hours is difficult. My wife is a family physician, who uses the internet for continuing education, which is also difficult during peak hours. And I sing in a church choir and we use YouTube for educational purposes. So we see what our masters are doing and we try and emulate them, and it\u2019s very difficult to watch a YouTube video without interruptions.", "15038 I fear that property values will be affected, making a move to an area with better internet costly.", "15039 THE CHAIRPERSON: Since you\u2019re a translator you\u2019ll appreciate that the interpreters have to follow. So just slow down a little bit.", "15040 MR. GAMMON: Sure.", "15041 THE CHAIRPERSON: If it takes a minute or two more that\u2019s just fine, but we\u2019ll be able to hear you. Thanks.", "15042 MR. GAMMON: No problem.", "15043 So the difficulty in telecommuting has meant that I\u2019ve elected to retire rather than continue commuting to Montreal. Because I\u2019m unable to do video conferences, I had a lot of problems with VPN connections. Large downloads are difficult to do in a timely manner. I had to do a lot of large downloads during the night.", "15044 In the forties and fifties the county where I live was electrified. Phone service has been around for a very long time. The infrastructure exists and has existed for a very long time. And I\u2019m just wondering how difficult is it to string a cable on existing poles? No provider is willing to do so apparently, and I have tried them all.", "15045 If the current attitudes of the deregulated telecom industry had prevailed in the first half of this century, our phone would still be on a party line shared by so many that it would be hard to use, and our hydro would be a 12-volt system with regular brownouts to 1.2 volts.", "15046 Remarkably, countries similar to Canada have managed to achieve it. Finland, for example, has had a program to make high-speed internet a basic right, and to have everyone at 100 megabits per second down by 2015. We need a similar program in Canada, perhaps inspired by the legacy of one of our greatest cabinet ministers C. D. Howe, who was instrumental in building this country's infrastructure at a critical time. Ironically, he was an American. ", "15047 In practical terms, what does rural unreliable internet mean? I can't speak for others. For myself, as a retired IT professional, it made telecommuting a challenge. When I was still working, I worked from home several days a week. Many times I had to fall back on tethering to my cell phone to get the internet working to meet a deadline. I consoled myself with the fact that that was still cheaper than driving to Montreal. ", "15048 We've considered selling our home and moving to an area with reliable and fast internet. After all, we'd only have to move 10 kilometers. But that is a radical and costly step.", "15049 I have developed some strategies to get around bandwidth caps and slow download speeds. For example, my wife and I like to watch a movie on Saturday night. So we select our movie on Friday night, and then at the restaurant where they have free public Wi-Fi where I have breakfast with friends every Saturday morning, I download the movie on my IPhone to play back with Apple TV when I get home. ", "15050 Similarly, I\u2019ve had to turn off automatic updating on my computer so I don\u2019t bust my bandwidth cap. As we speak, I\u2019m at 85 percent of my monthly capacity and I still have another week to go. We do keep a close eye on bandwidth.", "15051 My bottom line is that the telecom providers in Canada have failed in their duty of public service in the current deregulated market, and that failure is glaring.", "15052 Therefore, I think the government should re-regulate the provision of internet services. If it is not technologically feasible yet to provide service faster than 10 megabit per second down to last-mile clients, and I highly doubt this, then at the very least it should, in the short term regulate that providers deliver at least 80 percent of advertised speed at all times, or at least have more truth in advertising because I\u2019m getting nowhere near the advertised download speeds at peak times.", "15053 Providers have a Service Level Agreement that is clear, providing response times in case of system failure and compensation levels if those times aren't met. I\u2019ve had long outages with Xplornet due to technical problems in their first generations.", "15054 And the cost should be no more than or identical to similar packages in areas where high speed internet is available. It\u2019s like looking at a gas station where gas is $2.00 a liter on one side of the road and $1.00 a liter on the other side of the road, and there\u2019s a barrier the two and you can\u2019t cross it.", "15055 So in the medium-term, I think Canada needs to follow Finland's example and make 100 megabit per second download and 100 gigabyte data cap the standard to which everyone has a right. I believe this is realizable within five years, but I doubt that providers alone will do so at a reasonable and fair price structure for last\u00ac-mile clients based on recent history. ", "15056 And I do believe government intervention is necessary and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. ", "15057 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your intervention. We all chuckled a little bit on your movie nights on Fridays. They say romance is dead but that\u2019s still nice to hear.", "15058 So I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner Vennard.", "15059 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Hello.", "15060 MR. GAMMON: Hi.", "15061 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Thank you for coming to talk to us today and letting us know some of your concerns and frustrations with respect to your service.", "15062 I have a few questions for you. In your area how many homes are -- we\u2019ve heard a lot about these different pockets of stranded people that are in these unserviced areas. ", "15063 MR. GAMMON: Right.", "15064 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And so your situation unfortunately isn\u2019t unique in that sense, which doesn\u2019t alleviate any frustration for you, that\u2019s for sure. ", "15065 But one of the questions that we\u2019ve been asking people is how many people are actually affected by this? You say that you\u2019ve got six homes?", "15066 MR. GAMMON: That\u2019s correct, yeah.", "15067 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So is it just a small pocket of six homes or is it bigger than that? We\u2019ve heard of up to sometimes even a couple hundred houses.", "15068 MR. GAMMON: I\u2019d say probably 50 homes if you look at the area that I am that has some difficulty in getting connectivity. The fixed line wireless works in some places but its line of sight -- and I happen to be in an area -- our road happens to be an area where the line of sight doesn\u2019t reach or it doesn\u2019t reach reliably. I tried it for some time but it was too unreliable, and I was working from home at that time and I could not use it.", "15069 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. So you haven\u2019t gotten any satisfaction nor made any progress in trying to get your area serviced?", "15070 MR. GAMMON: No. The only provider that can service us at the moment is Xplornet. They regularly drop publicity in my mailbox for their 100 megabit per second down LTE 4G wireless, and when I call them they say, \u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t quite reach your area.\u201d So it\u2019s kind of frustrating to get the publicity but you can\u2019t really act on it.", "15071 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. I basically have one question for you, which is what specific action should CRTC contemplate to try and handle both your situation and the situation of other people?", "15072 MR. GAMMON: Well, I think that there needs to be a realistic target like Finland had that said, you know -- and we can argue about what it is, but it needs to be a realistic target that\u2019s achievable with technology but that has some foresight for the future.", "15073 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And what would that target be?", "15074 MR. GAMMON: Well, right now with the 10/1 that I have supposedly, I could live with that if it was reliable and it was delivering that on a consistent basis and I didn\u2019t have the latency time. So, you know, if a wireless -- either fixed wireless or a cellular network provider at a reasonable cost -- could meet that target, I could probably live with it. It\u2019s not the best but in the short term I could live with that.", "15075 In the long term I think you have to aim for 100 and 100 gigs of data cap.", "15076 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So what would the long term be, 10 years, five years, what?", "15077 MR. GAMMON: I\u2019m saying five years at the moment.", "15078 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Five years?", "15079 MR. GAMMON: Yeah.", "15080 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So to go back to my question, what specific actions could CRTC contemplate to handle your situation? So making a target speed is one of them.", "15081 MR. GAMMON: Making a target speed. Obviously there\u2019s a disparity of technologies that will need to be applied to different areas that have different challenges. But, you know, if we had used this -- the approach we have now was totally deregulated, you know, in a time when telephone was completely regulated, you know, almost every home was reached and Hydro reaches every home. ", "15082 You know, so there needs to be some kind of impetus to the industry to say you need to serve these people. It\u2019s a public service. It\u2019s no longer a, you know, for profit or, you know, competitive marketing thing. You need to service these people. It\u2019s a necessary service; it\u2019s part of the infrastructure.", "15083 And I think the priority I would set would be buildout of the infrastructure because, you know, if you don\u2019t have the infrastructure to get those kind of speeds it\u2019s pointless to set targets. So I think the first thing to do would be to build out the infrastructure and make sure you reach out at those last mile clients.", "15084 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Who do you think should be responsible for building up that infrastructure?", "15085 MR. GAMMON: I think that the government has to give an impetus to the industry to do so. I think they have to do it -- they have the technology. You know, Bell built their phone infrastructure at one point in time.", "15086 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "15087 MR. GAMMON: And it has to -- you know, we have to go back and look at what we did back in those days and see what worked and what didn\u2019t. And, you know, the fact is, everybody\u2019s got phone, you know, or almost everybody now, except for the ones that are getting rid of it, have a, you know, a landline. Everybody has hydro. It\u2019s public infrastructure.", "15088 So either we have to think of some way of making it public infrastructure or getting the industry to realize, yeah, we own the infrastructure but we have a duty to provide it.", "15089 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "15090 MR. GAMMON: And at a fair price.", "15091 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Are there any other actions that you can think of that you could suggest?", "15092 MR. GAMMON: I think for the -- in a very short term I think there has to be a bit more truth in advertising. And the pricing is a big issue. For me, the pricing is a big issue. It\u2019s not a question of affordability. I can afford it. But it\u2019s frustrating to pay double what other people are paying. And, you know, nobody gets rich by spending more than they have to. ", "15093 So that\u2019s been a big frustration has been the pricing. You know, at $107 a month for 10/1 that\u2019s not even reaching, you know, in peak times 25 percent of 10/1 is pretty frustrating when, you know, just down the road they\u2019re paying $50 for the same service.", "15094 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So standardizing and setting a standard, pricing is an issue for you as well.", "15095 MR. GAMMON: Yeah, and price -- and also standard for truth in advertising. If you\u2019re going to deliver 10/1, if you\u2019re saying you\u2019re delivering 10/1, well, it should be that most of the time or at least within 80 percent.", "15096 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. We have a study that shows that the providers are actually delivering in most cases in excess of what their advertised speeds are.", "15097 MR. GAMMON: That could be in other areas, but I can say for sure that\u2019s not the case with Xplornet with their satellite service in peak times.", "15098 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. Okay. Do you have any other specific actions that we could contemplate that you\u2019d like to suggest?", "15099 MR. GAMMON: No, I think those are the basic ones that I would suggest for now.", "15100 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I don\u2019t have any more questions for you. Do you have any final comments that you would like to make?", "15101 MR. GAMMON: No, I think I\u2019ve said what I had to say.", "15102 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn you back over to Mr. Blais.", "15103 THE CHAIRPERSON: Of course, our SamKnows Study did not include satellite, so it was for wireline services, so not covered.", "15104 But you\u2019re not satisfied that in advertising that they point out that it\u2019s \u201cup to\u201d?", "15105 MR. GAMMON: They point out that it\u2019s up to but I don\u2019t find 22 -- I think it was 22 percent that I -- I done a bunch of tests before coming here to --", "15106 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "15107 MR. GAMMON: -- accumulate data. And 22.4 percent is what I get in the evenings.", "15108 THE CHAIRPERSON: And did I hear you said that 80 percent should be a norm? That the \u201cup to\u201d can\u2019t be less than 80 percent of what you promised?", "15109 MR. GAMMON: I think that would be reasonable. You know, I think the technology exists. 10/1 is not really superfast Internet.", "15110 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So why 80 percent? So why did you choose that number just ---", "15111 MR. GAMMON: Out of a hat. But --", "15112 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. There\u2019s no science behind it.", "15113 MR. GAMMON: -- but basically -- alls [sic] I know is 20 percent is ---", "15114 THE CHAIRPERSON: It\u2019s a very honest answer. That\u2019s fine.", "15115 MR. GAMMON: Yeah.", "15116 THE CHAIRPERSON: It\u2019s --", "15117 MR. GAMMON: Yeah.", "15118 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- okay.", "15119 MR. GAMMON: But, you know, at 20 percent I can\u2019t watch a YouTube video.", "15120 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "15121 MR. GAMMON: Okay? Without having it choppy. In fact, I tried to look at some previous videos of the proceedings that have been going up to now, and at three or four times during the video it would drop out and stop for about 30 seconds a time. So it\u2019s annoying.", "15122 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Understood.", "15123 I believe those are our questions.", "15124 MR. GAMMON: Okay.", "15125 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for having participated in the hearing. And as you know, there\u2019s subsequent phases and hopefully you\u2019ll be able to participate in those as well.", "15126 MR. GAMMON: Thank you.", "15127 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "15128 Madame la secr\u00e9taire, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.", "15129 THE SECRETARY: I will now ask i-CANADA to come to presentation table.", "15130 We will also connect by Skype for Mr. Hutchison.", "15131 MR. HUTCHISON: It\u2019s Bill Hutchison. Can you hear me?", "15132 THE SECRETARY: Yes, we can hear you. You may begin your presentation. You have 10 minutes.", "PRESENTATION", "15133 MR. HUTCHISON: Thank you. ", "15134 Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to speak today. My name is Bill Hutchison. I\u2019m the Chair and Co-Founder of the i-CANADA Alliance created six years ago to encourage and support Canadian communities, large and small, to transform expeditiously into some of the world\u2019s leading smart, intelligent, sustainable and resilient urban, rural and remote communities.", "15135 The 60 governors on our Governor\u2019s Council include mayors from communities large and small from Edmonton, Surrey and Halifax to Stratford, Fredericton and Berwick in Nova Scotia, along with leaders of private sector companies like Tangerine Bank, Schneider Electric, IBM and IMAC Systems and institutions like OCAD University and George Brown College, to name just a few in each category.", "15136 I-CANADA has tabled a written submission as requested, but today I\u2019d like to respond to the request you made, Mr. Chair, on Monday last week in which you asked for a focus on the question does Canada currently have a coherent national broadband strategy. And you said, \u201cIt strikes me that this CRTC proceeding launched over 12 months ago may very well be the last, best chance to get it right, the chance to create together a coherent national broadband strategy through an open and transparent process based on evidence from all Canadians achieved, to the extent possible, through a consensus and implemented through shared responsibility.\u201d", "15137 First, let me say we certainly don\u2019t have a coherent national broadband strategy. And we certainly don\u2019t need another national telecommunications commission on this topic to figure it out. We tried that route a few times over the last four years and we still lag behind the world.", "15138 We agree with your comments of last Monday and we need to quickly move to achieving the goals you\u2019ve defined by creating a national action initiative, one that collaboratively moves Canada to regain world leadership in communications that we once enjoyed. The process and goals in that action initiative must include the features you so well describe, an open and transparent process based on evidence from all Canadians achieved, to the extent possible, through consensus and implemented through shared responsibility.", "15139 We\u2019ve done this previously in Canada. One good example was in 1991. Our federal government of the Department of Industry facilitated a national collaborative planning process to create a strategy and plan for establishing one of the world\u2019s most advanced communications infrastructures for our research and education institutions. ", "15140 I was honoured to be retained by Industry Canada to chair that process, which ultimately included, if you can believe it, a steering committee of 250 people from all relevant public and private sector organizations and provinces and territories. Meetings of the steering committee were held every four months to continually build consensus. And the process was managed through a 20 person executive committee.", "15141 We developed a national consensus and created a 7-year, $1 billion business plan with $900 million from the private sector and 100 million from the federal government. We incorporated a new organization and called it the Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research Industry and Education, or CANARIE.", "15142 The Ottawa Citizen then said in bold headlines, \u201cThis bird will never fly.\u201d Today, 23 years later, all agree that CANARIE has been one of the world\u2019s pioneers and leading performers in national research and education network. I\u2019m pleased to say the bird continues to fly very well.", "15143 You know, other country\u2019s national broadband action morals have been successful too, although they were less collaborative. In recent years, United States has been ranked well behind world leaders in broadband performance and availability. To rapidly move the U.S. forward, President Obama created an organization called US Ignite to drive innovation particularly in IT and telecommunications. Many new, very impressive initiatives have already been created through US Ignite, although it is not really a national consensus built strategy.", "15144 My confidence in Canada\u2019s ability to achieve the important roles you so effectively defined last Monday is derived from my years of working internationally and the many years I\u2019ve watched and participated in Canada\u2019s unique broadband challenges and opportunities.", "15145 Fifty-nine (59) years ago I worked on the installation of a new, advanced long-distance communications central office in New Liskeard, Ontario, population 4,500 kilometres north of Toronto. Twenty-four (24) years ago it was CANARIE for 4 years as Chair before and after incorporating CANARIE Inc. For 5 years starting in 2005, I led the planning, design and initial implementation for one of the world\u2019s most advanced award winning gigabit communications services in the new waterfront Toronto communities. ", "15146 I\u2019m also aware of the many innovative broadband initiatives by i-CANADA participants. Canada has many world class broadband islands of excellence with a lot of existing infrastructure in which we can rise up to create global leadership in tomorrow\u2019s ultra-broadband communications.", "15147 Achieving that goal will be difficult, although not impossible, but the rewards are worth the effort too. They include a geographically and socially inclusive Canada. A Canada that is innovative, competitive and productive, and one which more easily meets our Paris COP 21 goals because of our world leading broadband communications infrastructure.", "15148 i-CANADA looks forward to working with others on an urgent national collaboration initiative, as you requested or suggested, to define the plan and achieve the broadband leadership.", "15149 Now that\u2019s our opening statement, and let me just say that i-CANADA is also sponsoring a World Summit -- Future Cities Summit, June 8th and 9th -- sorry, 9th and 10th in Toronto, and we\u2019ll be addressing this in further detail. And we invite members of the Commission and anybody that is presenting to come to that summit and we can chat about it further and help to kick off a national collaboration.", "15150 Thank you, Mr. Chair.", "15151 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your presentation. I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner MacDonald.", "15152 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good afternoon and thank you for bringing your voice into -- into this proceeding.", "15153 Before we get started, I'm just wondering -- you represent about 70 smart or intelligent communities across the country, and I'm wondering if you can speak to what the characteristics of a smart community are and what benefits are brought to the area residents by virtue of living in a smart community.", "15154 MR. HUTCHISON: Well it\u2019s a great question, and usually when I give speeches I can take about 10 minutes to get rid of the confusion, and we in the industry have done it to all of our listeners because there are about 10 different definitions of a smart community all over the world. The Americans have one, the Brits have one, and there's the intelligent community definition. At least two definitions began in the early \u201890s, first Intelligent Singapore and then the Smart Valley in -- the Silicon Valley. So now we have sustainable cities, we have resilient cities, and every other name that another consultant or an academic could come up with. ", "15155 But broadly though, I think it\u2019s important to know that it\u2019s all about using the latest in digital technology and communications technology to find ways of transforming the city or the town or the village in ways that provide better service, more convenient service, more productive operation of the cities and towns. But by convenience I mean, you know, even in lot of countries the delivery of health care right into your home. The diagnostics of whether your kid broke their arm or not happened in a home in Sweden through their networks.", "15156 Intelligent Community Forum is a think tank in New York that really has promoted the praise intelligent community over 15 years, and they have an annual competition for the Intelligent Community of the Year. So there's some pretty good statistics in the winners there.", "15157 The first thing is they like to distinguish intelligent from smart. Smart often sort of implies really a techie thing, we\u2019re going to engineer it for you, whereas the intelligent community also includes a social inclusion, a digital inclusion, so some of the broader elements of our cities and where we live. But the winners inevitably have faster rates of economic growth, their Innovation Index is going up, they're getting more incoming investment, and it\u2019s a much more convenient place to live. ", "15158 And so the idea behind i-CANADA when we created it six years ago, was if we could get enough cities and towns all winning that award, then Canada\u2019s Innovation Index would go up. Now you may know that Canada\u2019s Innovation Index compared to OECD countries has been going down over the last eight or 10 years. So creating this national movement and if we can achieve these goals is much better, we think, than walking around Parliament Hill with the placards saying \u201cWe should innovate more\u201d, then we all go home and nothing happens.", "15159 So the intelligent and even the good smart communities all have these impressive increased rates of economic growth, inclusion, incoming investment. And I\u2019ll give you a very fast one that relates to broadband, if I may. Now Chattanooga, Tennessee, a city of about 100,000 people, was concerned that they were not getting the new automotive companies and other investments that were going into Nashville and other places in the south as car companies were setting up down there. So they forwarded a city bond, they created the first gigabit network to all homes in Chattanooga, the first line in the United States. Within two years they had four billion dollars of new incoming investment from three companies, Alstom, Amazon and Volkswagen. So there's -- and there's all kinds of stories like that, but -- so the intelligent -- and they won the Intelligent Community of the Year. So in brief, those are the key characteristics.", "15160 MR. GANDER: Bill, if I might just to add one thing further to that. A big part of this is the integration of all of the aspects and sectors of the community together using the technology to pull them together, is to create a community, not just a set of different technologies, so that the police, fire, emergency services are connected to the city\u2019s utility systems and its lighting systems, so that they all coordinate and work as one. And that's important to us because the innovation economy that we\u2019re in is an economy where connections lead to new ideas, that\u2019s what innovation is. And if we don\u2019t have that, we\u2019ll fall behind in the innovation economy itself. So I just thought I\u2019d throw that in, Bill.", "15161 MR. HUTCHISON: That\u2019s Barry Gander, one of the cofounder of i-CANADA as well. Thanks, Barry.", "15162 MR. GANDER: Yeah.", "15163 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: We\u2019ve heard from other municipalities -- and I don\u2019t know whether they're part of your membership or not, but that have picked up the torch and actually made investments to run their own infrastructure. And I'm the Commissioner for Atlantic Canada and Nunavut, so I\u2019ll speak to an Atlantic Canadian example, and it\u2019s -- I see Fredericton is on your list of communities that you mentioned earlier today. And one of the projects that they undertook a number of years ago was through their company Innovations to run -- fibered all of their facilities. So I'm wondering how much of -- how much of what's involved in becoming an intelligent community requires a municipal government to make those investments in the infrastructure.", "15164 MR. HUTCHISON: It's quite ---", "15165 MR. GANDER: If I might, Bill, this is my area of the world, this is -- Atlantic Canada, can I talk to that?", "15166 MR. HUTCHISON: You have better roots there now.", "15167 MR. GANDER: I moved to Atlantic Canada not too long ago, and I want to add regarding our past presenters the comments about living in a rural area. My wife and I have always lived in a rural area and I happened to move into a house -- as my wife says, \u201cOn the road to nowhere\u201d -- but we\u2019ve got a fiber cable running right past the house. So I have 100 gigs going to my house -- or 100 megs going to my house for $100 a month, and this was a network established by a family company, this is not a big organization. And one of the reasons in fact I moved to Nova Scotia was because you get small grain variety, and competition picking up where quite often the large telcos leave behind. And I\u2019m not against the telcos, I used to work for Bell in Saudi Arabia, so I have no problem with that, but sometimes they are inadequate. And I\u2019m circling around to your question if you don\u2019t mind.", "15168 The fact is the ICF that Bill was mentioning, the Intelligent Community Forum, in its 12 years of giving out awards for Most Intelligent Community of the Year, never has given an award to a city that was driven by a telco. It\u2019s always been either a city government or a utility in the city. Those are the organizations that are driving the most advanced, fastest, most innovative networks, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fluke over 12 years that you would find that.", "15169 Now Fredericton is one of one heroes. Brad Woodside, the mayor of Fredericton, is one of my personal favourites. I took him across Canada with me to show people this is what the mayor of a smart city looks like. He had wonderful phrases to help people along. We had a meeting -- other mayors across the country and one of his favourite lines was, \u201cI don\u2019t charge people to walk on my sidewalks, why would I charge them to use my WiFi?\u201d And so it\u2019s a brilliant little crisp flash.", "15170 For example, he was with me when we were pulling together seven mayors in the Vancouver area, and he was explaining how a smart community worked and what they should really expect from this to happen. And at the same time, we had the CIO from Seattle at that same meeting of these municipalities, and the Seattle CIO said, \u201cWe have open competition and open networks in Seattle and we have 140 ISPs in Seattle, you have three in Vancouver with closed networks. Where is a business going to locate, Seattle or Vancouver? It\u2019s going to be in Seattle.\u201d Those are the kinds of pressures we need to put on people to make this country work. So places like Fredericton are ideal for us. ", "15171 In fact, Brad Woodside is one of the two founder or co-founders now of our movement called \u201cThe Rise in Communities Movement\u201d, where we\u2019re taking the mid-section of Canadian cities and addressing their particular problems like Stratford -- in fact, the mayor of Stratford is the other co-chair of this movement -- and addressing them in particular to say this is how you build yourself up. These are the tools. These are the steps you take. This is what it really feels like as a mayor to face these problems.", "15172 And, of course -- and Bill, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you now because I think the next step in this, we have a whole process to do this and then we talk about i-Valley a bit later but you might want to talk about the governance issue, Bill, as the second most important thing.", "15173 MR. HUTCHISON: I\u2019d like to just -- some people say well, what's \u201cour ask\u201d. I'd like to suggest there's no question, we have great examples of excellence and Stratford and Fredericton are two of the real great ones and there are others. West Parry Sound for example pulled seven regions together and they're doing some great things.", "15174 But, you know, we have to look at the country nationally and I think the point has already been raised by the Chair in his comments a week ago and we've heard from other communities in the north and remote communities and those in anti-poverty but we have a lot of other communities as well that really need to have this addressed.", "15175 And so it really does call for a national strategy and a national program and \u201cour ask\u201d would be to in fact set up a new -- an independent national organization. It could be the CRTC or it could be a separate organization do the kind of thing we did with CANARIE.", "15176 CANARIE was really a focused community. It was the research and education world but there are communities in big cities.", "15177 For example, in London, England, there's a tremendous community of game, computer game developers in Soho. They have very, very high broadband and they have a very high broadband connection right down to Hollywood and every time a new movie is announced, they're in there talking to everybody in Hollywood about let us do your special effects.", "15178 Well, Toronto needs that and other cities need it and, you know, we could leverage off things that others are doing and leverage off existing infrastructure if there was a national program and that's why we really need to do it.", "15179 I have to show you this. This was in the Globe and Mail when we first created CANARIE and it was all about creating this thing for Canada. I look a heck of a lot younger in that picture but the fact is it was an unbelievable national collaboration and that's what we need. It has to be independent but with all the players.", "15180 I mean when we started CANARIE, I'll tell you the two incumbent phone companies would not even sit in the same room with each other and in the end they signed on to the business plan.", "15181 So this could be done again but I think we really need the national one. Otherwise, there's no question some cities will kind of take it upon themselves but they're all building it separately and we have these islands of excellence but we've got a whole lot of islands that just don\u2019t have a thing and a lot of communities that don\u2019t have the ability.", "15182 You hear a lot about everybody is pulling fibre these days and that would be great. Fibre has been around for 30 years and it's been in the ground for 30 years. So it's nothing new and the fact is the rest of the world is now moving with 10 gigabits and 30 gigabits downloads and thing like that. So we're still way behind overall and, you know, we're moving forward but the rest of the world is moving forward even faster.", "15183 So we would ask that we create this national initiative. We really look forward. We've got a broad base of members as you can see. As Barry said, we expect to add another 200 rising cities in the 10 to 100,000 population range and just a fabulous opportunity but we really have to get moving.", "15184 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So I'd like to draw on some of your experience with CANARIE and I've had some dealings with CANARIE over the years. And it strikes me from your presentation today that it is not an easy task to try and bring 250 participants together on one steering committee and actually end up with the desired result at the end of the day.", "15185 So do you have any best practices that you can share with us about how to do that, to develop the strategy and who should be the leader of such a strategy once it's being developed?", "15186 MR. HUTCHISON: Thank you. It's a great question.", "15187 And I have had the privilege of working with all different -- all three levels of government over the years. I would say that the CANARIE one was probably the best example of how to do it.", "15188 So Industry Canada, they retained me, a private sector guy, and I've had one foot in the academic world and one in the private sector for many years and even at the moment I'm chairman of 10-university collaborative research program led by the University of Toronto funded by ANSER (ph).", "15189 So, first of all, Industry Canada, this is important. They, in a sense, outsource the control and design of this to this group that got put together. They are ex officio on it and obviously they have a hand in it all and they were going to put 100 million in. So that was -- that was important but they didn't try to run it themselves. They left it to us and they had a broad base.", "15190 Now, I have to tell you I stumbled initially, initially because they asked me to do this. So I hired twenty -- well, I didn't hire. I recruited 25 people that I thought would be really good to develop the strategy and that worked until they said, \u201cBill, this is a federal program. If you think you need 25, you need 25 from each province. So that's how we got the 250 people. So we created an executive committee as well.", "15191 So the executive committee was important but what was important were these national consensus building sessions of a day or two every four months and we moved those around the country. So everybody had a say and I said it took two years. I think it got probably close to the three years, back and forth and back and forth, but this is an amazing program and it's a billion dollar program for a seven-year period.", "15192 But I think just the facilitating, they were obviously involved. The Ministry of Industry of course was very involved and at the end, they said, \u201cBill, we've got to get the private sector to get their money in first and be advised we'll put ours in too. We're with you.\u201d", "15193 So it was a great partnering and that sort of an approach I'd say was the main best practice. And then after that it was all about how to collaborate and giving people a sense that they were all contributing.", "15194 MR. GANDER: The other piece, Bill, if I might jump in again, that really impressed me was how you pulled together the Toronto project involving all of the different sectors to come together on a plan for Canada\u2019s first gigabit network. And that was the model for i-CANADA.", "15195 Bill brought together the healthcare workers and the police chiefs and the people who are involved in subsidized housing, everybody who had an interest in benefitting from a very high speed network, and they created their future as it were, envisioning what it should be, and with this group you were able to push through an almost uncontested plan for a gigabit network.", "15196 Is that about right?", "15197 MR. HUTCHISON: This is at Waterfront Toronto. I'll tell you, there are things you have to overcome and, you know, you've got a lot of people with views about how things should be done.", "15198 It actually took me two years to convince the Board of Waterfront Toronto that we should issue an RFP to give out a concession for somebody to run the waterfront network. They did comment that they didn\u2019t join the Board of Waterfront Toronto to get into battles with major companies.", "15199 But we did it. It was open to everybody. Everybody could bid and it's there running and once there are more people living, these are the new waterfront communities, you'll hear more about it but it's up and operating.", "15200 MR. GANDER: The thing we pulled out of that in fact was the model for i-CANADA and how it works. Every community is different across the country but the steps are the same.", "15201 We go into a community. We pull together the leaders of the community, both the economic and social leaders, and I'll do this in a fine-grained fashion from where I am now in the six months since I've gone to Nova Scotia.", "15202 I've created an organization called i-Valley or intelligent valley. It's all about the Annapolis Valley, 200 kilometres of Annapolis Valley and Canada\u2019s garden land, but we have created a network of leaders all up and down who understand why this should be done. We've had hearings in front of those leaders on what the broadband network is all about and why it's important.", "15203 We brought in some colleagues from the United States for example, for Louisville, who were talking about what the gigabit network means to them. We brought in other experts to explain it and now what we're doing is going up and down the valley, town by town by town and sector by sector by sector to say what is it you want in an intelligent community.", "15204 But in order to do that right, we also bring in industry people and other experts to show them what the state of the world is in education. What does it mean if you can teach English in Korea without leaving your living room, those kinds of things because they don\u2019t know.", "15205 And as I say, this is 90 percent social dynamic and 10 percent technology. As my favourite Don Cherry would say, this ain\u2019t rocket surgery but it really is important to get these people on board.", "15206 Then we go back to the community and say, \u201cThese are your goals you have told us about and we'll put those into a plan with options.\u201d This is what Network A could look like, and Network B, and Network C, and these were the costs. And by the way, we'll help you try to find the funding because there are many ways you can get funding these days and only part of it is federal or provincial because they're pretty tapped out in many cases, but there is money out there from the user community. For example, you could do a public/private partnership kind of thing, many ways to make that all work. ", "15207 And then of course, the network starts to get built, but it's not an instant process. It's going to take two or three years to create this. One of the things I-Valley has going for it is that there's already a fibre network going up and down the valley. The problem is, nobody knows about it because they've always thought of it as a piece of technology, so nobody's explained it to people. ", "15208 We had a public meeting in Berwick, for example, a little tiny town. Apple capital of Canada, if you're looking for a vacation idea. But we had 50 people show up at that meeting, almost with flaming torches, saying, \"We want broadband now. When is our broadband coming?\" ", "15209 So I take a little bit of issue with our colleagues with Saskatchewan who were here earlier saying, \"We don\u2019t understand where the demand for broadband is coming from.\" It's coming from the little software developer in the -- in Hall's Harbour, little people who are trying to run their own -- one of the things about this economy now, you've got to realize -- and maybe you already do, of course -- but 55 percent of the new businesses are being started by people with gray hair. These are people who are in retirement who are starting something new and they want that, they need that gigabits kind of connection to make their businesses work. ", "15210 Even in Ottawa here, you don\u2019t have enough speed to run the kind of businesses that are needed. I know because I'm involved in a program to expand that. But for example, not too far from here -- you've all seen maybe \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie? The texturing for that entire movie section was done by two guys in a garage here in Ottawa, and they couldn't send their files back and forth fast enough on Ottawa's network, so they put them onto drives and mailed them to California. ", "15211 So this is the kind of thing we need to think about, seriously, when we're talking about the industry of the future. Anyway, I digress. ", "15212 MR. HUTCHISON: Let me just interject here, Barry. Just for the Commissioner, one more point that I think is really important, because I think the one big takeaway -- and there's some great examples that Barry just listed and there are just all kinds of them about the benefits. But one other point on your question, Commissioner, is the best practices. ", "15213 Now, when we started the CANARIE Initiative, there were really two national incumbents, Bell and UniTel in Canada. They didn\u2019t want to sit in the same room as each other at that time. And over time, they signed on and they were very much part of it and they benefitted themselves from it. I'm not suggesting that this would be easy, because now there are a lot more incumbents, but I would say the other key factor, success factor, was in making sure that everybody was participating and feeling that they were being heard and participating. ", "15214 So this is not about creating some independent thing. This is -- I started my life with Bell Canada. I worked with other communications companies, was in the media business. I was on the board of Torstar and with them for a number of years. So it's about getting everybody moving forward. And the first few meetings, nobody wanted to act and everybody will be complaining, but I know that. ", "15215 But just in answer to your question, I would say that that was probably the other main contributing factor to success, and that was just getting everyone collaborating and getting through that (inaudible) part and letting them see the benefits of the fact that we need a new model. The model we have started years ago. ", "15216 But there are social benefits now that you can't recover if you're a supplier of these services. If the health care doctor can diagnose your kid right in your living room and you don\u2019t have to jam up the hospital outpatient thing, you don\u2019t have to go to clinics, well, the phone company or any communication company can't charge enough for that to cover the cost, and yet the social benefit, there are people that suggest we could knock 10 percent off our annual health care costs if we really did this right. ", "15217 So getting everybody involved -- and I can tell you, too -- Canada is not about saying, \"Ah, let's go and do it ourselves with the little guys,\" or something. It's all about -- we all have to be together and it takes a little doing, but that was a key contributor on CANARIE as well. ", "15218 COMMSSIONER MacDONALD: You touched on an issue a minute ago about people wanted access to broadband now but no one even knew that the fibre line was running down throughout the Annapolis Valley, and that's something that's been repeated a few times by a few different intervenors here, that even if there is a community or a small service provider that wants to deploy last mile connectivity to a particular community, they have difficulty in knowing where transport capabilities are or obtaining access at a reasonable rate. ", "15219 Has that been a problem, that some of your member municipalities have faced?", "15220 MR. GANDER: Oh, absolutely. You really nailed it with that. In fact, it's the number one problem in the valley and it's not just the customer not knowing. It's the provider not being able to tell the customer because in a sense, the customer hasn\u2019t been aggregated for them in a model that they understand. They might be used to dealing with large customer groups in cities, for example. ", "15221 But if you work the Smart Valley situation, you can pull these customers together into groups that are identifiable, and that's a demand that a provider can understand. So it's a matter of making visibility happen on two sides of a mirror, if I'm able to put it that way. ", "15222 Definitely, the part of the process we have to do is to show each of the user groups where they can get the services that they need, and the user groups are very different. For example, Acadia University is one of our collegial organizations in A-Valley and it runs a fabulous program in agriculture where they're starting to use drones to fly over the farmers' fields to look for moisture and fungus conditions and that kind of thing. That's all data intensive kind of activity, and they don\u2019t even know where to start connecting and nobody else knows what their story is. ", "15223 So we have to start getting that -- that's what we've started to do now, getting their story out. And this is not a very difficult thing to do, but it's just that it hasn\u2019t been done, so we're starting to do that now and making these things visible and making these things happen. ", "15224 The other thing I was going to mention, further to something Bill was saying, this is so fundamental that it is affecting the ordinary, as it were, ordinary people on the ground, in their property rights and their property values. There was an article in one of the Nova Scotia newspapers some months ago now saying that this guy was suing one of the service providers because his property didn\u2019t have an internet connection, so it was valued at $15,000 less than the guy next door who did. ", "15225 And that's the kind of thing that these guys are really aware of. You don\u2019t have to convince them that they need it. They know they need it. They don\u2019t quite know what they need, and they don\u2019t quite know how to get it, but the hunger is there. It's absolutely fierce. ", "15226 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So sort of along that same line, you stated that part of your role as an organization is to encourage communities to, you know, to undertake these types of initiatives, so that at a practical level, how do you do that? Is it finding them access to transport facilities? Is it knocking on doors to help get people onto a network to help them prove a business case? ", "15227 UNKNOWN SPEAKER: That's part of it. We have a step-by-step process, of course, but it starts with the city council, for example, in telling everybody what is -- what the process of achieving a smart community is. It's all about governance at that level, and then we go out into the community and find out from the community, with explanations to the community in all of its sectors, what they want to have and getting their input on what they want to have, then creating the network model for them, and then either with them, hiring somebody to provide that network service or we'll find a way to do it ourselves, but we don\u2019t like to do that. ", "15228 The fact is, we're not contractors. We're just facilitators, and we're a not-for-profit organization, so it -- we're more comfortable in the connecting role than in other roles. And of course, as I mentioned before, some help with financing -- locating financing, if that's needed. ", "15229 At the end of a term, though, for example, if we go up and down the valley or anywhere else, we create, for example, an econometric model for the communities to show in this community, you put in this amount of broadband and you will get this amount of return. And it's like, $1 gets 200. And we can show this. We have the models for it, and they're real. ", "15230 The fact is that the return on investment from an investment in broadband is enormous and it's stunning to the -- even to the town council that suspect something is valuable, to show them, through their businesses, how that will improve and what that will do.", "15231 So we show them the econometric model, and then we make sure that the plan we\u2019ve got will achieve that, and then onto the network and so on. So it\u2019s a step-by-step process and that\u2019s why it takes a little bit of time. ", "15232 But right now, for example, we have little tiny towns in the Annapolis Valley, like, Lawrencetown; the population may be 800. They\u2019re trying to build their own network. They\u2019re starting to put up their own towers. They -- bless their hearts. And this was before we arrived, as it were. But that\u2019s the kind of thing that\u2019s going on because people want it. They need it. They don\u2019t know what to do.", "15233 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Is that a model that you would be able to share with us from past conversations with other municipalities?", "15234 MR. GANDER: Sure.", "15235 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Is that something you could file on the record for us to have a look at?", "15236 MR. GANDER: Sure, absolutely.", "15237 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "15238 MR. GANDER: Yeah. ", "15239 ", "UNDERTAKING", "15240 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And just one final question that speaks to leverage in that initial investment. And I note that, you know, in the CANARIE experience you were able to leverage about $100 million into a $1 billion investment. And I\u2019m just wondering, is that typical that you\u2019re able to leverage $100 million in government money to obtain $900 million in financing or investment on the part of the service providers?", "15241 MR. HUTCHISON: You know, it depends on the project. In the Waterfront Toronto one, even though Waterfront Toronto is an organization and is owned as a partnership, all three governments -- City of Toronto, Ontario, and the feds -- there was no government money in that one. All the money came either from developers or concession rights, not to the communications provider. So each one is a little different. ", "15242 And you know, and if you take Chattanooga, for example, I think it was about a $300 million bond that they put up and they got $4 billion back from the private sector investors earned in two years. So, you know, a 9 or 10 to 1 investment is generally realistic but there are public private partnership models. Chairman of the Public-Private Partnership Council of Canada Mark Romoff is one of our governors. ", "15243 And so we\u2019re bringing, i-Canada is bringing all of these people together as we move forward and to help these communities but there is absolutely a big leverage factor. The government is playing an important role. They play a leadership role. But the model that I describe for creating CANARIE really worked.", "15244 I\u2019ve been involved in other initiatives and you know, sometimes there\u2019s a feeling by the public servant that we should do this ourselves. They think they\u2019re getting a little notch on their belts. And they don\u2019t work out quite as well as if you get a whole range of people. ", "15245 I was on the -- on Mr. Mulroney\u2019s as vice-chairman for the National Advisory Board for Science and Technology as well, and we\u2019re 36 people from across the country on that one plus six cabinet ministers. And it was all to drive policy and that sort of thing but it worked well also.", "15246 So there are different models. I think the fact is that collaboration is so important. And between us all we can figure out the models, but there\u2019s no question there\u2019s a tremendous leverage on some government funding. And what the governments can do is create some sort of, you know, national compatibility (inaudible) and this is important when you\u2019re in these areas and you\u2019re looking for standards.", "15247 MR. GANDER: Something like that is happening on a mini scale here in Ottawa, in fact. There\u2019s a meeting later on this week that pulls together some of the leaders of Ottawa under the auspices of Bruce Lazenby, the head of Invest Ottawa to -- and bringing up my colleagues from the United States as well to discuss how SMART Ottawa is going to evolve. So this hopefully will be in your houses very shortly.", "15248 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Perfect. Well, those are my questions. Thank you very much, and thank you for traveling in from Nova Scotia.", "15249 MR. GANDER: Thank you. ", "15250 THE CHAIRPERSON: So it would appear that those are all our questions, so thank you very much for having both participated in the hearing. ", "15251 And as you know, there\u2019s two further stages in the proceeding on the 25th of May and the 13th of June, and of course you\u2019re welcome to make submissions in that context.", "15252 MR. GANDER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.", "15253 MR. HUTCHISON: Mr. Chair, I would like to invite you, and we\u2019ll follow it up in writing, to be a speaker at our summit June 9th or 10th. And it would be just wonderful if you could. You\u2019ve encouraged us in the past with some of our initiatives and we certainly appreciated that too.", "15254 THE CHAIRPERSON: That\u2019s very kind. We\u2019d have to consider of course if it was appropriate in light of the fact that we would be deliberating at that point on the hearing so we\u2019ll see.", "15255 MR. HUTCHISON: Well, we\u2019ll have everybody from all groups at the event so there you go.", "--- (LAUGHTER) ", "15256 THE CHAIRPERSON: No danger there.", "15257 MR. HUTCHISON: We\u2019re not biased.", "15258 MR. GANDER: Speaking of all groups, in fact I might re-iterate Bill\u2019s invitation to extend an invitation to all the people who have been in front of you for a free seat at that summit; not a problem.", "15259 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, thank you.", "15260 MR. GANDER: Thank you.", "15261 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for that.", "15262 MR. GANDER: Thank you. Thank you all very much.", "15263 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "15264 Madame la secr\u00e9taire, les prochains intervenants, s\u2019il vous plait.", "15265 THE SECRETARY: I would now invite OneWeb to come to presentation table.", "15266 Please introduce yourself and your colleagues, and you have 10 minutes for your presentation.", "PRESENTATION", "15267 MR. WYLER: Ten (10) minutes. Well, we\u2019ll do our best. ", "15268 This is -- well, I\u2019ll start off thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Chairman, Commission, Commissioners, lady and gentlemen.", "15269 It\u2019s a pleasure to be here on behalf of OneWeb. And I\u2019ll sort of shorten this presentation a bit to make it in 10 minutes. To my left is Mr. Don Osborne from MDA, and they\u2019re Canada\u2019s premier space company. And then beyond her is Ms. Leslie Swartman, and then to my right is Marc Dupuis. And my daughter is back there but she didn\u2019t come up.", "15270 So this has been great to watch the testimony of everybody. And I\u2019ve seen a lot of very interesting points from the issues of city connectivity to the issues of rural connectivity. And OneWeb is really about rural connectivity. It focuses and answers and addresses the issue of the individuals, schools, communities, and houses that are remote and just too far from physical infrastructure.", "15271 So as the testimony over the past two weeks has shown, and as you have eloquently summarized, Mr. Chairman, telecommunication services have converged onto the internet. Access to high-speed internet is therefore the only facility required to provide all telecommunication services essential to fulfill the needs of Canadian citizens in today\u2019s digital economy. As more and more citizens abandon their landline phone for cellular and Voice-over-IP, the copper cable for those fortunate to have it, will be used primarily for internet and the so-called plain old telephone service will soon be irrelevant. ", "15272 Therefore, we support the Commission's view that the definition and application of basic telecom service needs to evolve to internet connectivity. ", "15273 So we believe that Canada should strongly consider minimum service specifications for broadband access, and we will also present some views on how to enable access for every household. ", "15274 Let's start with the most important specifications for a broadband. Coverage is the foundation of any service. Whether a user is mobile or at rest, they must have access to simple and reliable connectivity. Coverage is highly personal. Internet access down the street, as we have seen, is different than internet access which reaches your home. ", "15275 Government coverage maps today are by postal code, town, or hexagon tile. When even one house is covered the maps colour code the entire tile, but a house-by-house view would show a much different picture. ", "15276 Coverage must also be feasible, meaning all the way to the residence or the institution serviced, and be installed quickly. ", "15277 The next three criteria are technical by nature and a bit complex. Each specification affects the others, and their importance has changed over time. For instance volume, the number of gigabytes per month, was irrelevant when people only had 64 kilobits per second line. Latency mattered less when people only used bulletin board services and maximum speeds were 256 kilobits per second. However, the terms are the crux of what we call broadband and we applaud the Commission for taking the time to carefully review them.", "15278 There are plenty of other terms we could suggest but these really highlight what is necessary to understand broadband. ", "15279 Speed defines how fast data can be sent and received between the customer premises and some point of presence on the Internet. It is typically advertised as \"burst speed\" or \"up to\", which have different contexts. As the connection between your computer and the destination server transits many networks or links in a chain, the actual speed is only as fast as the slowest link; therefore, adding to the confusion, every customer will, to some extent, experience a variation of speeds depending on the site they visit. However, most major sites are located only a few hops from the user and so the experience for those sites should be consistent.", "15280 Volume. Defines how much data the user can consume in a given period of time, typically measured on a monthly basis. Most providers will place some limit, often referred to as data caps, based on their subscriber's data plan, and if the cap is allowed to be exceeded additional costs or the speed is reduced.", "15281 This is to ensure that one or a few subscribers do not significantly use the network's resources to the detriment of all of the users. You've heard much about this over the past two weeks, and unfortunately, they're just a reality of limited bandwidth.", "15282 As speeds have increased, so has our ability to devour content. \"All you can eat\" plans work fine for children with small appetites, but the local football team would put any restaurant out of business if they came by every night for dinner.", "15283 The good news is that volume limitations, like \"all you can eat\" limitations, are a sign of a mature market. It means that speeds have reached a point that people can consume Internet at a high rate. Once the speed is high enough and the latency is low enough, then paying per byte is a simple and viable metric.", "15284 Latency. You've heard a lot about latency and it really is important. It's the most defining aspect of usability once a link speed reaches 1 or 2 megabytes per second. Why? Because it literally is the time, it takes to go get a packet from the other computer. It is also highly and reasonably misunderstood.", "15285 Each of these three criteria vary in importance depending on each other and they also affect each other. Confused yet? The result is they are all important.", "15286 Let me explain. Imagine you live on the 36th floor of an apartment complex. You turn on the hot water but cold water comes out of the faucet. It turns out the boiler is in the basement, so you have to wait for the hot water to climb the 36 stories to the faucet.", "15287 While you are experiencing the latency, you call the plumber. The plumber comes over the next day, upgrades your piping at great expense, from one quarter-inch diameter pipes to one inch pipes. Now, you have big pipes. Fantastic.", "15288 The next morning, you turn on the hot water. It still takes the exact same amount of time for the hot water to arrive. All the plumber did was increase the volume per second, or what we call speed in Internet terms. But you are still waiting; however, you do have a lot more volume per second so you consume more water.", "15289 So you ask your friend in the same building if she experiences the latency. She says, I get hot water really fast; it's practically instant. You think about it and you realize that she lives on the first floor. She's literally 36 times closer to the boiler than you are.", "15290 This illustrates the relationship between volume, speed and latency. They play a role with each other, and the only solution for latency is to have the content closer in distance to the user. Why? Because packets, being represented by electromagnetic waves, travel at the speed of light, so latency and distance travelled are highly correlated.", "15291 Internet through GEO satellites is on the -- that's like being on the 36th floor, which is the case for all services, because as you'll see, GEO satellites are at 36,000 kilometres. OneWeb is building a system to bring the satellites down to 1,200 kilometres so you'll be on the first floor. The latency is just a pure physics question, how long is the distance the packet has to travel?", "15292 Every website you use will be affected by latency. Internet applications like videoconferencing, virtual classrooms, and gaming, are all difficult, if not impossible on a high latency link. There are many examples of how latency affects the use of the Internet.", "15293 What's the impact of latency? Modern telecommunications networks and software applications that run on these networks are designed for end to end two way latency below 100 milliseconds. LTE and 3G wireless networks require low latency for the hands off between cell towers. Internet applications require low latency networks for quality, and in some cases, to even function.", "15294 What can be an irritant in voice calls or a videoconference due to the delay between one speaker and his or her correspondent becomes untenable for Cloud applications, VPN networks, or even video laden web pages.", "15295 I believe it was the Affordable Access Coalition that mentioned the recent FCC Connect America Broadband program and its 100-millisecond latency limit. The FCC, as have many other governments, have struggled with these specifications and recently condensed the important specifications to a nutrition label called the Consumer Broadband Label. And can you see on it the focus is speed and latency as two of the primary important pieces.", "15296 OneWeb is designed to provide a path latency below 30 milliseconds, and even adding terrestrial connections to the Internet, the end to end latency will still be below 50 milliseconds, roughly equivalent to fibre, DSL or cable modem services.", "15297 OneWeb is a new low latency satellite system designed to provide a service with a user experience identical to a cable modem, whether you're in Nunavut or here in the national capital area.", "15298 Currently, 18,000 Canadian households are located in satellite dependent communities in remote and high latitude regions. OneWeb will begin to roll out services in 2019.", "15299 As our satellites will operate in near polar orbits, the extreme latitudes will be the earliest served and get the best connections. In fact, we'll be able to provide services to Northern Canada before the rest of the continent. The North will be the first in receiving such new services with quality comparable to urban terrestrial-based services and without the lag or pointing issues of GEO satellites.", "15300 OneWeb will wholesale to all the Canadian operators or to some of the Canadian telecom operators, who will then retail services to the public. The low latency network will cover 100 percent of Canada, improving the availability and overall quality Internet for everyone.", "15301 Uniquely, OneWeb's terminals will provide both direct to home broadband Internet and increased local wireless service coverage. Each terminal is a cell tower. It provides 3G and LTE services to the region around it. This will help spur local entrepreneurship, jobs, enable digital education, medicine, telemedicine, government services, and connectivity.", "15302 Another feature of the terminals, besides being less expensive and easier to install, they are also very low power because they're only pointing and sending signals to a satellite only 1,200 kilometres away. So it's 36 times closer and it requires so little power it can operate on batteries or on solar panels.", "15303 The OneWeb terminals can provide transportable or relocatable LTE wireless for emergency care that can be placed on trucks and vehicles and allow emergency care technicians to have coverage wherever they go.", "15304 So what do we do? The Commission should consider establishing two targets for broadband Internet access. One that can be included in the definition of basic service and the other which is needed to achieve full grade broadband service. Something others before me called an aspirational goal, but which I will refer to as full broadband service. Such basic and full broadband target speeds or technical criteria should be considered on a regular basis.", "15305 Telecommunications services, similar to any other consumer product, require a standard set of specifications. The consumer information need to -- needs -- the consumer needs to understand and compare available offerings, including speed, volume, latency and price.", "15306 We suggest that the Commission consider defining the terms for basic service and broadband service with the idea that the basic service offering should be designed to promote affordable access to lower income populations at a minimum price, to ensure that every Canadian has the access required for such necessities as children's education and access to important services.", "15307 So two questions you might ask yourself. One, is there a price point for basic service which is low enough that the Commission may consider offering it to every rural household free of charge? Two, what is the cost of Canada and residents not having access to the Internet for digital government, education, and telemedicine?", "15308 There was an interesting and excellent point brought up by the former speakers about the ancillary value of Internet access that's not recoupled by the provider. It's well beyond the service charge, but the ability to do telemedicine and drop the costs of digital government.", "15309 So many government services in Canada are available online. As I understand it, some services are available only online. So what happens to those left behind?", "15310 Rural communities have a particular and unique economic and social vulnerability with regard to communications. Brain drain occurs as individuals move to places with better jobs and better access to education. New, innovative start-ups and companies must have access to survive but there's no option for them to locate in these communities.", "15311 True high speed Internet availability will be like rays of sunshine for these communities, promoting growth and stability. They will benefit from a better access to government services; they will have a stronger voice and be a better position to advocate for their needs. Their children can have access to the world's best education and start their own business, writing enterprise software apps, gaming or Cloud services. Maybe some of those children will know enough about the needs of rural communities that they build specialized applications for education or telemedicine, which will be used, by communities around the globe.", "15312 Market forces alone will not ensure basic communication services to all citizens. Disaggregated and rural communities individually have typically not represented a large enough market for industry to focus its energies.", "15313 Canada has an opportunity here, an opportunity to pull all the communities together into a single market. If you do you\u2019ll be surprised at how inexpensive rural broadband can be.", "15314 Current technologies such as fibre, cable and microwave have costs that are highly related to housing density. ", "15315 In remote areas, even with the deployment of such technologies, the backhaul costs drive prices. Countries around the world struggle with the limited availability of existing communications.", "15316 Lastly, the Commission must be technology agnostic in its approach. Every technology has its own specific features.", "15317 Fibre, for instance, is excellent for data transmission. However, it is expensive per kilometre to install and has ongoing maintenance costs that can exceed its value for thin routes.

There is obviously no way to recoup that investment based on Broadband fees alone. ", "15320 In fact, communities do not actually need fibre, they need connectivity. New technologies will enable the same exact connectivity without having to run the fibre. I can give you an example. ", "15321 In 2007 I formed a company called 03b Networks, which stands for \u201cThe Other 3 billion\u201d and we designed and launched 12 of the highest speed communications satellites ever built.

The RFP could stipulate that funding would be provided for at least 100,000 homes, so that bidders know the value of the minimum contract price.

A maximum installation time could be included.", "15329 Service Providers could then submit bids to provide a basket of services. The bidders with the best basket could win and after the infrastructure is completed, the winner would then have to sell the product. ", "15330 Each customer would reduce the government commitments and represent an upsell opportunity to the service provider to provide the Full Broadband Service.", "15331 Result? The Service Provider would then have a known minimum quantity customer base and could be reliably incentivized to build infrastructure in regions which otherwise would represent too high of a risk. ", "15332 The government\u2019s support as a guarantor could be a key and a dollar neutral way to ensure all Canadians have access to basic service and would provide an optional upgrade path to the full broadband service.", "15333 The definitions of basic service and full broadband service should be updated and revisited from time to time in order to ensure that they properly reflect the needs of Canadian citizens and consumers.", "15334 I would like to thank the Chairman and Commissioners for your valuable time and your interest in our presentation and we\u2019re ready to answer any questions you may have.", "15335 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for that presentation.

WYLER: Well POTS is a technology; voice communications is what they\u2019re looking for. So there could be many other versions of voice communications that allow for redundancy, for instance mobile phone services.", "15341 You could easily, for now, keep POTS going.

WYLER: So you might not be needing to shut down the copper line and no one would say cut the copper line if it exists. If you already have the infrastructure you should use it to the best of your availability.

You can take a subsidy for this or you can take a subsidy for this?", "15346 MR. WYLER: I haven\u2019t actually thought about subsidies specifically. Of saying let\u2019s subsidize internet versus let\u2019s subsidize POTS, because if you have plain old telephone service, then your internet, as I said, is probably going to come over DSL and you\u2019ll have DSL and POTS together.

WYLER: M\u2019hm.", "15350 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right? And I was wondering if your suggestion is saying we no longer require that. We should only subsidize internet broadband.", "15351 MR. WYLER: I suspect you could subsidize one or the other and if somebody took internet that would include a VoIP service. ", "15352 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "15353 MR. WYLER: But if they didn\u2019t have access to the internet, then get the POTS.", "15354 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, okay. Yes, okay thanks for clarifying.

WYLER: Yeah, what we're saying is if you put forward an RFP and say every rural household -- and you can add them up -- maybe there's 300,000, maybe 500,000, depends on your definition of rural. Maybe it's two homes per square kilometre or 10 homes; you have to work that out. ", "15424 But if you put that RFP out, we would respond and I'm sure others would respond. We would respond with telecommunications service providers as partners, and I think you'd be surprised at the pricing of that.

I don't know the price of the broadband service, but some portion; 10, 20, 30, 50 percent may upgrade to even have a much higher speed, a 25 megabit speed, and have HD video and the like. And of course, that will generate more revenue for the company, but at least we'd get everybody connected.", "15426 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So what would be the estimated costs of these enhanced services that you would offer? And we talked about the basic at 5 and 1. What would the enhanced -- I forget your terminology -- I'm sorry, because it was just presented here, but --- ", "15427 MR. WYLER: The full broadband service. ", "15428 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The full broadband service, and I'm assuming that might tier up too, but what would that look like?", "15429 MR. WYLER: So we would not be providing the service; we'd be doing it through a telecom service provider, someone who is a local operators and the local different ISPs. But likely it would be within 10 or 20 percent of what the cost would be for a cable modem in the city.

WYLER: Yeah, yeah, so it would be within 10 or 20 percent of --- ", "15436 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, but if somebody was paying for a gigabit service or something like that that they were paying --- ", "15437 MR. WYLER: Yeah, well, the gigabit's probably not where we're targeting. We're targeting a 25 megabit per second, even a 50 megabit per second service.

", "15440 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: In -- for one of your -- through your provider to one of the customers would be about $100? ", "15441 MR. WYLER: It would be in the -- yeah, in the ballpark of the same price, whether -- if it's 75 normally in the city, then it would probably be around $75, plus or minus 10 or 20 percent. But we don\u2019t see the need to have a huge rural penalty. It should be really around the same price. But we don\u2019t set the prices. The telecom service provider will set the prices, ultimately.

WYLER: I think a start-up business, they would start there and they would -- it depends on what type of business. If you're just doing transactions to know how much gas you pumped, sure. But if you start to move into other aspects of a business, you're a start-up, then you probably want to go a little higher. ", "15444 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, so I'm still not sure I believe this. So can you confirm that the technology's been tested as in place? You're talking a 2019 launch, right? And you're talking -- just again, to confirm for the record, 5 and 1, data allowance of 10, and you referred maybe you got 30 milliseconds latency path and the end to end is 50, right?

It's -- we've been very fortunate to have Virgin, Qualcomm, Hughes, which makes the Jupiter broadband system that you're familiar with. Intelsat is an investor, Bharti, Grupo Salinas -- I'm sure I'm forgetting -- and MDA, of course, and of course, Airbus is a big investor.

I think 95 percent of the cell phones of the world use Qualcomm technology. Intelsat's the largest satellite operator in the world. So there's quite a few people around the pile here and they've done a lot of work in developing and designing and testing the system. So -- and we've put a lot of money into it, so there's a lot going on here, and we're on track. ", "15458 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: There is a lot going on. I -- and the people's -- you know, you do have other people like, I was reading up on it and such as Richard Branson speaking very well of you.

I\u2019ll just read it to you, the paragraph -- two paragraphs: ", "15460 \u201cBut other companies have tried a similar undertaking before and found the cost far too high. \u2018It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this,\u2019 said Roger Rusch, a satellite industry consultant in Palos Verdes. \u2018It's inconsistent with experience. These people are up against the laws of physics.\u2019 ", "15461 So I just want to -- I mean, there\u2019s many other nice things said but enough to make me ---", "15462 MR.

It\u2019s just energy.", "15465 But, seriously, the systems that were done before, so this is what\u2019s happened is -- and there\u2019s a few people say, \u201cWell, people tried to do things before.\u201d Yeah, people tried to build cars before the first one worked. People tried to build airplanes before the first one worked. That all happened.

", "15488 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I mean, I\u2019ve got to give you one last chance; are you that guy at this hearing, or do you really have the solution?", "15489 MR. WYLER: We\u2019ve put hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into this. We have 20 -- we\u2019re the largest launch purchaser in the world, probably -- there might be someone else who\u2019s bigger but we bought 21 Soyuz rockets; they\u2019re scheduled, they\u2019re being produced right now. We have three launch locations. We bought 39 Virgin Galactic launchers. ", "15490 We have established, if you look last week, we announced our factory in Florida where we\u2019ll be manufacturing the world\u2019s first high-volume rate production facility for satellites right on NASA property at Cape Canaveral. ", "15491 There\u2019s a lot of people around the table here and a lot of people pointing in this direction, a lot of digital -- I mean, a lot of due diligence has been done on this system, a lot of testing. So we\u2019re really, really far along on that. ", "15492 So can we be late? Maybe. Does the technology work? Yes. So we\u2019re real excited about it.", "15493 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I forgot -- sorry; I apologize, I should never say I have one last question because it\u2019s often not true.", "15494 There was one thing I just wanted to check. Your satellite terminals, when I checked online they were still patent pending. On your Web site there was a patent pending technology on that. I just wanted to double check that that was -- it\u2019s good to go? ", "15495 MR. WYLER: We have -- our terminals are -- there are many varieties of terminals. The terminal on an airplane is different than the one on a ship which is different than the one on a cellular backhaul system. Some of those are ready to go, so to speak, if they\u2019re -- you know, if the satellite system was up and everything was put together, and others are still in development and others are ideas that will come in the future and continue to drive the cost down. ", "15496 So there are many versions that are good to go and there are versions that are just -- that are ideas, and there are versions in the middle that are in testing. ", "15497 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks very much for your presentation. I enjoyed it and I appreciated the time that you took to try to address some of the basic issues for -- in terms of the greater public interest. ", "15498 I\u2019ll turn it back over to the Chairman and perhaps my colleagues. ", "15499 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "15500 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. ", "15501 I\u2019m going to accept the expertise of all your investors about your technology and that it works and all of that, and I just want to talk a little bit on the business side of things. ", "15502 If I understood it properly you\u2019re not proposing coming here that you may be a service provider willing to aggregate unserved Canada and deliver this basic and enhance broadband. You would be -- you\u2019d be delivering the satellite capacity to a service provider who you think might -- I\u2019m just looking at your presentation where you made the point that for unserved rural, the government could aggregate all the unserved customers to make a potential business case for a service provider who might bid on that. That was what you proposed?", "15503 MR. WYLER: Yeah, so we would be a -- probably the principal technology behind a service provider. But somebody has to do the billing and show up at the house and take the phone calls and things like that. And that\u2019s not what we\u2019re building a company to do.", "15504 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "15505 MR. WYLER: So we would work with many or one.", "15506 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "15507 MR. WYLER: We\u2019ll see what happens in Canada.", "15508 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And this notion of delivering free or, you know, five, $10 basic service would be delivered by a service provider, not by you?", "15509 MR. WYLER: They would be the billing agent and the person that you call. The reality is it would be coming from our satellites down to a terminal which somebody built for us that they installed or was self-installed.", "15510 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, for sure. But they\u2019re going to set prices and they\u2019d be the ones setting the prices for any kind of enhanced broadband services as well.", "15511 MR. WYLER: Yes, but -- and we would be working as close as we can, especially if it -- when it first comes out. So in other words, if you put out a bid and said, \u201cWe would like every house covered. Tell us what it costs. And every house. Not -- don\u2019t cherry pick the goods ones, the easy ones near the city or the ones that you have line of sight for with wireless access or whatever, every house.\u201d You\u2019d find a lot of really interesting companies and industry really trying to respond. And we would work with one or all of them to help get that price to something, which I\u2019d like to see a very high take rate. There\u2019s a mission behind the company and that\u2019s to connect every school and also to have all the rural households connected.", "15512 And if Canada took a bold step forward and did that and you are in a position to do that because you\u2019re a wealthy country with a lot of very wealthy cities and populations that are rural that you could afford under these premises to support, that would be a great leadership position for a lot of the other countries that I deal with and governments that I talk to who are not in the same financial condition as Canada.", "15513 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. So while this speaks of aggregating the unserved, underserved into a basket and potentially one contract with service level guarantees and all of that, I get that. But the notion of a basic service that would be at a free or nominal price, you would have a lot of people within urban Canada going a little bit crazy if that was only available within the unserved and rural communities.", "15514 So I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve thought of that that ---", "15515 MR. WYLER: Maybe they\u2019ll move. I mean ---", "15516 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Oh, you haven\u2019t thought of that?", "15517 MR. WYLER: City flight or something to the rural areas.", "15518 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So I mean, in looking at whether or not this was a viable business opportunity here in Canada, with the number of unserved in rural --", "15519 MR. WYLER: Yeah.", "15520 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- Canada and the potential of the amount of those that would upgrade, you clearly came thinking this was a viable option.", "15521 MR. WYLER: At the ---", "15522 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Is it a viable option if that kind of a basic service is available throughout Canada?", "15523 MR. WYLER: At the risk of putting my foot in my mouth, you never want to say you don\u2019t want customers, but every customer in a city who has cable option and a fibre option and takes one from the satellite is taking one of the number -- the finite number of customers that we could serve that would be in the rural areas. ", "15524 So Canada would probably have to make a -- the government would make a distinction and a decision that there are areas around Canada where it\u2019s very hard to get broadband. If you live in a density of less than 2 homes per square kilometre, of 10 homes per square kilometre, whatever the number is you decide, and Canada believes that they should have -- it\u2019s very important that they have access to broadband.", "15525 Now the price for full-on broadband will be the same as any provider, maybe even a little bit more expensive by 10 or 20 percent. So they would veer towards one if it\u2019s local and available. But the basic service is really designed to get everybody online.", "15526 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "15527 MR. WYLER: It\u2019s not designed to be a city -- an income balancer in the cities. I mean, it might and it could work there, for sure but ---", "15528 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But I\u2019m sure you understand well but ---", "15529 MR. WYLER: Yeah.", "15530 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- I mean if there was a headline somewhere that there is free or $5 basic service available in rural Saskatchewan, some --", "15531 MR. WYLER: So ---", "15532 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- people in the city are going to say well, where\u2019s mine?", "15533 MR. WYLER: Well, they can and maybe, you know ---", "15534 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Just not through --", "15535 MR. WYLER: There are people who have ---", "15536 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- not through your low --", "15537 MR. WYLER: Right.", "15538 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- orbit satellite though; right?", "15539 MR. WLYER: Well, I\u2019d rather -- I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say I\u2019d rather not, but if there was one person in the city who had three other options to get broadband and there was one person in rural Saskatchewan who had no other options, I\u2019d rather give the person in rural Saskatchewan.", "15540 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm.", "15541 MR. WYLER: And, you know, there\u2019s a couple of things you could think about. You could even lower it to a two megabit and one megabit free basic service and say, you know, go to -- take the free basic service from these other people, but that -- but at least you\u2019re online. At least you\u2019re on digital government. At least you can get telemedicine if there\u2019s a -- and you can do -- I mean, it\u2019s so important that people have broadband just fundamentally. It\u2019s a lifeline.", "15542 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You don\u2019t -- we\u2019re all on --", "15543 MR. WYLER: You know that, yeah, so ---", "15544 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- we\u2019re all on board with that, yeah.", "15545 Just one more question. In serving the unserved, the rural and so on, one of the things we\u2019ve heard about other satellite solutions and certainly any kind of fixed solutions is the high cost of install and operations. Is that the case with yours as well?", "15546 I mean, there\u2019s lots of windshield time between some of these rural customers. So --", "15547 MR. WYLER: Yeah.", "15548 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- do you need the skills in the communities? Do you need the -- you know, an installer or is this kind of a citizen complete kind of a package?", "15549 MR. WYLER: It\u2019s certainly self-installable by anybody with moderate skillsets; right? The -- a few -- just a few differences between this satellite -- and I don\u2019t -- and the geo satellites. These satellites, because there\u2019s so many of them, are almost always directly overhead. So you\u2019ll point -- you\u2019re only looking up. You\u2019re not trying to get through the trees at 10 degrees or, you know, there\u2019s the horizon. You\u2019re 10 degrees over the horizon. There\u2019s almost always something in the way; right? ", "15550 So the pointing -- and they\u2019re self-pointing. So you don\u2019t have to aim it anywhere. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a wind chill -- there\u2019s a windstorm out there and now you got to come back in and kind of aim it and, you know, hear the beeps and stuff. That all goes away.", "15551 So there are a lot of things which make it less expensive and easier than installing the geo systems. It takes a lot less power as well.", "15552 So it\u2019s not magic. It\u2019s not going to self-install from, you know, parachuted in or something, but it\u2019s really a lot easier -- it will be a lot easier and a lot smaller to install than the standard systems that are out there today.", "15553 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "15554 MR. DUPUIS: Yeah, I\u2019ll just add a point if I may because I used to be with a geo operator so I know what it is to install a terminal.", "15555 What -- the other, the big difference, of course, is that it\u2019s a very small terminal. So anywhere you can FedEx or Canada Post anything you can FedEx or Canada Post a terminal.", "15556 The last point though on the installation, it is self-pointing. So in theory there\u2019s absolutely no difficulty at all to operate such a terminal, even if you have no experience ever installing anything for satellite. However, that final decision will rest with our friends at Industry -- ISED, the old Industry Canada. Because today they don\u2019t have rules that would permit self-installation. ", "15557 What we truly believe that once we\u2019ve convinced them that these terminals cannot cause any interference to anyone because they\u2019re self-pointing, that they may come up with the right rules that would allow us to let users self-install. But that would require a rule change at Industry Canada -- excuse me, at ISED.", "15558 Thank you.", "15559 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, thank you for that. And that\u2019s helpful.", "15560 Are there other regulatory or legislative requirements within your path to I think you said 2017? Is that your date?", "15561 MR. WYLER: We launch in -- next year we launch our first satellites and then we go on a launch campaign in 2018 with then services after that.", "15562 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any significant regulatory hurdles. We\u2019ve been working very strongly on regulatory issues for the past three, four years. So we\u2019re in pretty good shape.", "15563 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And just so I understand better, how many countries are you working to clear your regulatory hurdles over?", "15564 MR. WYLER: So it doesn\u2019t exactly work that way, but it --", "15565 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: No?", "15566 MR. WYLER: -- I mean, it sort of does.", "15567 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I mean, we\u2019re just using the --", "15568 MR. WYLER: Yeah.", "15569 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- example of what you need to do to --", "15570 MR. WYLER: Right.", "15571 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- get the terminal --", "15572 MR. WYLER: Yeah. He\u2019s talking about --", "15573 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- terminal cleared here.", "15574 MR. WYLER: -- the right to self-install, which is kind of a ---", "15575 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Which you wouldn\u2019t consider a regulatory hurdle?", "15576 MR. WYLER: It\u2019s not a normal regulatory hurdle.", "15577 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I mean, if you can mail it versus have somebody go there and --", "15578 MR. WYLER: Yeah.", "15579 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- put it in, that\u2019s a pretty big ---", "15580 MR. WYLER: Yeah. It\u2019s not a hurdle to actually having the system work, but it is --", "15581 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "15582 MR. WYLER: -- a hurdle to how fast you can send it and adopt it. And I think ---", "15583 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And the business plan I would think as it regards the cost.", "15584 MR. WYLER: Yes. So on a country by country we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re talking to pretty much every country of the world about different small little things that they might have and smoothing the path to harmonize the ability to -- just like you have to use a system, just like you\u2019ve harmonized the rules for using handsets and cell phones and Wi-Fi. And that\u2019s happening and it\u2019s happening across Europe. It\u2019s happening all over the world.", "15585 The primary regulatory hurdle is -- comes from the ITU. Under the UN there\u2019s a group called the ITU, International Telecommunications Union. And they\u2019re the ones who deal with the spectrum rights and we broadcast in a particular spectrum that we have priority rights from that. And then each of the countries sort of work with and within the rules of the ITU.", "15586 So but there are -- will be little things about setting up a business in a country and --", "15587 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm. M\u2019hm.", "15588 MR. WYLER: -- what taxes they have in telecommunications. And is this internet or is this phone service? Those will be country by country things that we have to look carefully at.", "15589 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right. And you\u2019ve -- you have examined Canada and the things related to delivery in Canada?", "15590 MR. DUPUIS: Yes, we have.", "15591 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Clearly you\u2019re down to the terminal now. ", "15592 MR. DUPUIS: Sorry. Yeah, so in Canada there\u2019s really one hurdle, if I can call it that. But as Greg said, it\u2019s not really a hurdle, it\u2019s just an inconvenience for the public if they have to rely on a professional installer when it\u2019s not really required. So again, it\u2019s just an issue that we have to work through with Industry Canada. And sorry if I use that name all the time because I\u2019ve ---", "15593 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That\u2019s okay.", "15594 MR. DUPUIS: --- dealt with them for 30 years. I haven\u2019t made the transition yet to ISED.", "15595 And in many countries it\u2019s fairly small. The key point, as Greg mentioned, is the big hurdle is to get recognized in the International Telecom Union. And we\u2019re very, very successful there. ", "15596 So we have the absolute priority for the use of the frequencies. We are number one in the list. And last year our team was at the World Radio Conference where all those regulatory decisions get made, and we managed to ensure that the regulatory regime has not changed. So we are in a very favourable position.", "15597 And now we\u2019re working country by country for things like licences, or landing rights, and this is just a process. You just go through it. Some countries have to make a few more little tweaks to their regulatory procedures. In Canada we\u2019re in real good shape. We are actually waiting hopefully for a licence from Industry Canada so we -- sorry, ISED -- and so we are waiting for that but that\u2019s still not a showstopper. We\u2019re making good progress.", "15598 And the same thing in many, many countries. And a lot of countries have -- like, in Europe they have a one system for the entire European block. So once you\u2019ve made it through their system -- and we\u2019re working through their organizations to get our terminal recognized. And once that\u2019s recognized we can deploy terminals anywhere in the 53 countries. We don\u2019t have to go country by country.", "15599 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And just one more question although I said I was finished. Are you making this pitch to other countries? Like, is this notion of a basic service at a minimum level -- is that something we would see you potentially, you know, pitching and see provided in many different countries?", "15600 MR. WYLER: Well, actually it\u2019s a great question and you\u2019re -- I\u2019ll just -- we do actually have the licence to operate from Industry Canada. One of them, and there\u2019s another one that we\u2019re waiting for, which in ancillary actually. But your question is really, really right on point. ", "15601 When we had submitted our documents to you we talked about this rural connectivity for all the rural homes. And there\u2019s been a lot of interest in it from different countries about whoa, you can solve my 10 percent problem. I can do the first 50 or 60 percent with industry, the next 20 percent I can do with huge subsidies, and then it gets asymptotically, you know, more expensive. It\u2019s like infinite dollars to connect the next home, right. And so we just live at the edge there in the last 10 percent and we\u2019ve had a lot of interest from a lot of countries. ", "15602 But the next step beyond that, we\u2019re talking with large government and global organizations, intergovernmental organizations, about doing something called a \u201cmodel bid\u201d. And it\u2019s along the lines of what we\u2019re talking about. And the model bid -- and you may hear about this more by September in a very large fashion -- is to aggregate countries that are in emerging markets to connect all their schools. ", "15603 So they will actually put the GPS locations of their schools up to a one single bid, and a large intergovernmental organization will be creating a model bid and what it means to be connected. How many megabits per second per student? How do you know that it\u2019s connected? You must have the internet access, the number of gigabytes being consumed sent to a public website. So I can look at a country and I can zoom in the school and I can say, \u201cThat school last month ate 20 gigabytes.\u201d So and that, what actually is used by the school, is what we\u2019ll pay the vendor. ", "15604 So that model bid that\u2019s being worked on and discussed right now in a bunch of different countries and forums may turn out to be something really large, which you could possibly aggregate a million or a million and a half schools together globally and get the intergovernmental banks to be supporting this, which would cover every school. ", "15605 And so that\u2019s really a way that we think we could -- and others because it won\u2019t just be us. It will be fibre players and telecom operators in lots and lots of different industries get together to support the rural communities and the rural schools. And so it\u2019s a very exciting thing, and I\u2019d love to share more with you on that if you\u2019re interested. But it\u2019s not a Canadian problem but it\u2019s a big one for the world. ", "15606 Fifty-four (54) percent of the population is offline, you know? I mean, I know that seems like a big number but it\u2019s the UN number. Fifty-four (54) percent of the world has limited or no access to the internet.", "15607 So your question about who could buy; well, you know, over half the world is still waiting.", "15608 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And 17 percent of Canada. The last time we measured was 17 percent of Canada.", "15609 MR. WYLER: Yes.", "15610 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just two clarifications. The right to self-install, is that under the Radiocom Act or is that a program issue?", "15611 MR. DUPUIS: I believe it would have to be in the details of the rules. It would under the Radiocom Act but it\u2019s not the Act that would need to change, right.", "15612 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, no, but it\u2019s under --- it\u2019s not with respect to Connecting Canadians.", "15613 MR. DUPUIS: No.", "15614 THE CHAIRPERSON: It\u2019s really about the Radiocom Act.", "15615 MR. DUPUIS: Yes.", "15616 THE CHAIRPERSON: And what was the thinking behind that policy when it was adopted, do you know?", "15617 MR. DUPUIS: The policy was adopted to protect other satellite systems, because if you mispoint your transmit antenna you can cause a lot of interference to the adjacent geo satellite in the sky.", "15618 THE CHAIRPERSON: Oh, for the transmit (inaudible), okay.", "15619 MR. DUPUIS: That\u2019s why you have to protect the system.", "15620 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "15621 MR. DUPUIS: But with us it\u2019s auto points. I guess Industry Canada will just need to be convinced that the risks are infinitely small, and so we just have to make the representation.", "15622 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. And when you were talking about lots of countries -- and I understand the socioeconomic situation of various countries is quite different, and you\u2019ve mentioned emerging economies, I get all that. That\u2019s all very valid but do all these \u201clots of other countries\u201d you\u2019re using include countries such as the U.S., Australia, France, UK? Sort of comparable markets to our own?", "15623 MR. WYLER: Yes, we\u2019re talking with all the different governments in all those countries, or some of those countries. And there\u2019s, you know, a lot of interest in how we can really -- you know, using new technologies is one piece of the puzzle. Really shift and change and get that last 10 percent to be covered.", "15624 It turns out and it was kind of interesting -- this is where the digital government in one of the countries it -- when we talk about these numbers they say, \u201cIt costs us more to keep this parallel government, non-digital government, the analog government running and keep little service centres open in these different communities so farmers can come in and get their cheques.\u201d ", "15625 It\u2019s they\u2019re just, like, we\u2019ll pay for the connectivity. It doesn\u2019t need to be the government. It\u2019s just cheaper for us to shut down the analog government. ", "15626 So there\u2019s a lot of interesting and fun conversation going on and they are comparable countries. Not the same land mass but ---", "15627 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, understood. Well, thank you very much. Very refreshing. Not necessarily we buy into everything but certainly refreshing in our hearing to change the face a little bit so very much appreciated.", "15628 And we wish you good luck with those launches because that can be quite negative if it doesn\u2019t work. Thank you.", "15629 So we\u2019ll take a short break until four o\u2019clock before we hear the last two intervenors. ", "--- Upon recessing at 3:47 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 4:01 p.m.", "15630 THE CHAIRPERSON: Order, please.", "15631 Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "15632 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "15633 We\u2019ll now hear the presentation of Brenda Borley. Ms. Borley is appearing by Skype. You may begin your presentation. ", "PRESENTATION", "15634 MS. BORLEY: Thank you very much, and thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Commission.", "15635 My name is Brenda Borley. I reside in the RM of Cartier in Manitoba, located six miles from the town of Starbuck, 10 miles from the town of Elie, and 40 kilometres from the city of Winnipeg.", "15636 My husband and I operate a medium-sized grain, oilseed, and forage seed farm. Here are the points I included in my intervention for this hearing, number 154.", "15637 At our home location we only have one option for high-speed internet service, one line of sight provider. The quality of service from our internet provider is not reliable and expensive. Reliable, affordable, and quality internet service is a basic requirement for us as consumers and as business owners.", "15638 When free TV went from analog to digital we lost all of our free TV signals, and self-service in our area is poor and varies greatly.", "15639 According to CRTC\u2019s statistics, the target speed of 5 down and 1 up for all Canadians was available to 94 percent of households in 2013. And on a map, our area is shown as this target being met. This is not the case, and I wonder how many other households deemed to have availability to this level of service in the 94 percent actually don\u2019t.", "15640 We currently pay $70 per month for 3 down and 1 up and 50 gigs of data. We do not consistently have these speeds. The internet often goes down. And the service and support from our provider is poor. We wish we had a choice of another provider.", "15641 Our service provider tells us they will be upgrading the tower, but they have said they would do this since the fall of 2014. If that actually happens, they tell us we will have to pay $99 a month in order to get the minimum upload speed of 1.0. In an effort to have some choice of internet provider, we\u2019re considering constructing a tower so that we have a line of sight to other internet towers. Of course, this is a cost we would have to bear ourselves that most Canadians don\u2019t to get a similar level of service.", "15642 The availability of cell service is also a related issue, and I would like to see basic standards for cellular services. Cell service is no longer a \u201cnice to have\u201d or a luxury service. It\u2019s essential in today\u2019s digital world. In rural areas, it\u2019s essential to business owners as they need to be connected to their customers and the markets. ", "15643 In our industry of agriculture, farmers need to have access to weather information, be able to sell their product and purchase inputs and obtain agronomic, financial, information technology and legal advice all from their smartphones. We get no cellular service in our yard, and poor or no service in many of our fields. We often have to drive down the road in order to send or receive text messages with our business partners. We sarcastically joke that it\u2019s like Oliver climbing the telephone pole to make a phone call in the old TV show Green Acres. ", "15644 Our monthly cell bill for our farm cell phones is $158. That\u2019s how much we pay for a service that we can\u2019t even access all of the time. Yes, we could purchase cell boosters in an attempt to get service in our yard, but does it make sense that we have to spend 1 to $2,000 to get a service that we already pay for?", "15645 Cell service is also integral for safety. If my husband has an accident in one of our fields where there\u2019s no cell service, I guess he\u2019ll have to write his goodbye message to me on the rim of the tractor tire instead of calling 911 for help.", "15646 As previously mentioned, we get no digital TV signals and must purchase satellite TV. When TV signals went from analog to digital, this was a step backwards in accessibility for rural Canadians and for many, increased costs. It\u2019s not like we can livestream TV with the current levels of internet service we have available to us.", "15647 I believe rural Canadians have significantly higher costs for internet, cellular service and television as compared to urban Canadians. Not only are there fewer vendors to choose from and therefore, higher prices due to lack of competition, but we often have additional costs just to access the service on top of the regular monthly fees, like purchasing cell phone boosters or constructing a tower. We currently pay $280 a month for internet, cell service and a landline, and that doesn\u2019t include our kids\u2019 cell phone bills.", "15648 In conclusion, here is what I would like to see included and considered in CRTC\u2019s basic telecommunication services. For internet, 5 down/1 up is a good place to start. We don\u2019t even have that now, but please, don\u2019t believe this target has already been met. I believe there are many, many households and businesses like ours that are deemed to have this available and it\u2019s not. Minimum data allowances should also be included in the standard. What good is high speed if you can hardly use it without incurring high overage charges? The minimum speeds and data allowances should be reviewed regularly as the digital world and technology continue to evolve. And reliability should be built into the basic standards. A service provider may offer the basic standard, but if the speeds are only obtained some of the time or if the line drops often or if it\u2019s down for substantial periods of time, the standard is not really being met. And affordability should be built into the basic standards. Right now there isn\u2019t enough competition in rural areas to encourage affordable prices.", "15649 For voice, I would like to see more choice for cellular service providers in rural areas to provide price competition. I\u2019d like to see some minimum standards for service in rural areas, specifically a basic level of cell service in all areas. And until reliable cell service is available for rural areas, affordable landlines are essential. We pay $46 a month just for a basic landline.", "15650 Television, free television signals for basic Canadian networks should be restored for all rural Canadians that no longer have access to the new digital signals.", "15651 Finally, I would like to you to recognize that these telecommunications issues are not only prevalent in remote areas of the country, but in areas like mine, within easy driving distance of a major city.", "15652 Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns about telecommunications services in rural Canada. If anybody has any questions about our personal experience, I\u2019d be happy to answer them.", "15653 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, Ms. Borley. Commissioner MacDonald will ask -- will start us off with some few questions. Thank you.", "15654 MS. BORLEY: Okay.", "15655 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good afternoon. I guess I\u2019d like to start off by asking specifically how does your small business use the -- use the internet. We\u2019ve heard from a lot of individuals in this proceeding, we\u2019ve heard from some small business, but I understand with the revolution in the way people farm and the automation of farming that you're maybe more dependent upon connectivity than you would have been in the past. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can tell me how -- how your farm actually uses the internet?", "15656 MS. BORLEY: Pretty much in every aspect of our farming operation, right from -- gathering information on production, monitoring the markets multiple times a day. In fact, I told my husband he couldn\u2019t be on the computer while I appeared because our internet -- he would use too much of our bandwidth, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sign in. ", "---(LAUGHTERS)", "15657 MS. BORLEY: There's everything, our bookkeeping, I keep our records on -- on the Cloud, all of our farm records, our financial records, our production records. We file -- we pay our bills online. We do our banking online, it\u2019s endless. Pretty much every -- every aspect of our farming operation involves transfer of data and gathering of information through the internet.", "15658 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And does that -- and obviously there's certain business functions, email, banking, things like that ---", "15659 MS. BORLEY: Yes.", "15660 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- that you\u2019d be doing. What about -- and maybe not just in the case of your farm, but the farming industry in general -- what about the automation of equipment and connected devices and what impact poor quality service actually has on your business operations?", "15661 MS. BORLEY: Well as far as cell service, there -- we actually don\u2019t -- other than -- of course there's GPS, which is separate, but there are certain GPS systems that will run off cell towers, we can't use them because I mean if we were going with a GPS system, it has to be accessible to every piece of equipment.", "15662 Honestly, we don\u2019t use -- we don\u2019t rely a lot on the cell service out in our fields because we can't. We can't employ that technology, we can't rely on it.", "15663 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: You mentioned the importance of local -- of telephone service because you don\u2019t have access to reliable broadband and you don\u2019t have access to reliable wireless.", "15664 MS. BORLEY: Yeah.", "15665 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: If those two problems were addressed, if you could ---", "15666 MS. BORLEY: Yeah.", "15667 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- connect with your mobile phone or you could do more Skype conversations or VoIP calls, do you think that the importance of a telephone would continue to decrease?", "15668 MS. BORLEY: Absolutely. Many of our neighbours that actually do have access to cell service cancelled their landlines, but we can't do that.", "15669 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: There's a funding mechanism in place whereby everyone pays a few extra dollars to ensure that telephone service is provided in higher cost serving areas such as your own. Do you think a similar funding mechanism perhaps should be put in place to address some of the -- some of the network problems that people face today, or is that best left to government subsidies?", "15670 MS. BORLEY: I really don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t be able to comment or estimate on the costs to provide a basic level of cell service or reliable internet service to households like ours. I don\u2019t know how many they are and I don\u2019t know how expensive it would be to provide that, so it\u2019s really hard to comment on that without knowing the numbers.", "15671 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. You mentioned affordability, what in your mind is a -- is a fair price? Do you think you're paying too much right now in relation to the service that you're receiving, or do you feel you're paying too much in relation to what someone in the city may be able to ---", "15672 MS. BORLEY: A little of both actually.", "15673 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- purchase?", "15674 MS. BORLEY: Yeah, a little of both. I feel $70 a month for three down/1 up that's not reliable is quite excessive compared to the city. I think a similar level of service in Winnipeg, if you're to go through MTS, would be about maybe $55 a month, but I believe most of those plans don\u2019t have data caps, ours do. Yeah, I\u2019d like to see -- I would be willing to pay a little more than my counterparts in urban areas, just recognizing that it would probably cost a bit more to provide us with that service, but not gouging.", "15675 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And just one final question, because you mentioned data caps, and we've heard that a number of times. It doesn't matter how fast the connection is, if you burn through your data allowance in the first week or two of the month you're at a loose end or facing significant overage charges towards the end of the month.", "15676 What in your mind should a -- I mean, should a data cap, a minimum data cap be set by the Commission, and if so, what level should it be set at?", "15677 MS. BORLEY: That's a very good question. I've put some thought into it and, of course, I believe that as -- if you increased your speeds available to you, you would use more data because it would be easier. I mean, we don't live stream anything here. I mean, we never watch television; we never rent a movie from iTunes and download it because number one, it would take forever. And as it is, we've gone through our 50 gigs.", "15678 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: How quickly do you normally -- even though you're being very cautious about what you do online, does 50 gigs get you to the end of the month or do you generally run out before the month ends?", "15679 MS. BORLEY: I would say it's about 50/50. Another shortcoming of our current Internet provider is we can't even check online to see where we are.", "15680 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So there is no tools in place for you to be able to check? They don't send you an email or anything to say you're getting close to your tab?", "15681 MS. BORLEY: No, it's a surprise when you get the bill.", "15682 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And can I -- just one final question. Can I ask who your service provider is?", "15683 MS. BORLEY: Yeah, it's Valley Internet Service Provider of Winkler, Manitoba.", "15684 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "15685 Thank you very much. Those are my questions.", "15686 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "15687 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Hi Ms. Borley. I'm the commissioner for Manitoba and Saskatchewan.", "15688 So I'm not sure that I have a question so much as a comment to provide you, because I know this is a big proceeding and it's great that you've chosen to participate and, you know, express your frustrations and experience.", "15689 And I'm not sure if it gives you any kind of comfort, but I grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan. Didn't even have a telephone until I was in Grade 6, so I do understand the issues. My sister is there now and is expressing to me similar issues to yours.", "15690 So we are looking at solutions, but I did just want to comment that while it appears we're far away, we actually do understand some of the issues that you folks are ---", "15691 MS. BORLEY: That's good. Thank you.", "15692 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- are experiencing.", "15693 Thank you.", "15694 THE CHAIRPERSON: I believe those are all of our questions for you, but I do want to echo my colleague's comments, how important it is for folks like you to actually participate in these hearings and we very much appreciate it to bring a different perspective and a richness to our conversation. So thank you.", "15695 MS. BORLEY: Thank you for the opportunity.", "15696 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thanks.", "15697 Madam Secretary?", "15698 THE SECRETARY: I will now ask Forum for Research and Policy and Communications to come to the presentation table.", "15699 Please introduce yourself and your colleague, and you have 10 minutes for your presentation.", "PRESENTATION", "15700 MR. STEVENSON: Good afternoon, my name is John Harris Stevenson. I'm the Vice-Chair of the Forum and a PhD researcher in Internet Governance at the University of Toronto iSchool.", "15701 With me today is Monica Auer, the Forum's Executive Director.", "15702 Monica?", "15703 MS. AUER: The Forum applauds the Commission for this process and for considering the inclusion of broadband and the basic service obligation. As we've all heard during this hearing, Canada requires an ambitious and unambiguous vision for affordable access to high quality communications for all Canadians, including those in remote and rural areas, and particularly, in the near and far North.", "15704 This vision is not your sole burden. All of us with government have a role to play, but the CRTC's leadership is essential to a sustainable vision for 21st Century communications in Canada from sea to sea to sea.", "15705 Today, we'll speak briefly about payphones, disruption, broadband speeds, and the Forum's recommendation of a target of 100 megabit per second accessibility by 2021.", "15706 MR. STEVENSON: This process has focused a great deal on broadband speeds, as it should. While speed is the most visible metric when we discuss broadband service levels, it risks becoming a false idol.", "15707 First, we need to be clear about what speed means. In network terminology, speed is sometimes used to describe the actual measured throughput at the end -- to the end user, but in other contexts, it is the ideal rated speed that network equipment can accommodate.", "15708 When Canadian ISP's offer Internet connection speeds of 50, or 100, or even 250 MIPS, these are ideal speeds that are only potentially available if every link in an Internet connection supports them. A network is only as fast as its slowest point of congestion. Real network throughput depends on network capability, a capacity outside of local, regional, and even national ISP control.", "15709 Second, as other parties have suggested, other network characteristics beyond speed also matter when it comes to the quality of basic Internet service. Others have made the case for low latency and the Forum agrees. Latency is important because low latency can be essential to web based Cloud applications, Internet telephony, and VPN.", "15710 Available bandwidth should also be a consideration, especially when it is rationed to end users through data caps. As well, symmetrical throughput offerings will be increasingly required in the future.", "15711 Returning now to speed, our written submission recommends that 100 megabits per second be available to all Canadians by 2021. This is an ambitious target and not one supported by current Internet consumer case -- use cases. Why did the Forum recommend it?", "15712 We began by looking at current trends in Internet usage and making informed guesses about which will wax and which will wane, and we assumed that Internet use will neither plateau nor decline. For example, we are still seeing uptake of streaming video and a transition away from traditional BDU carriage of video toward various forms of Internet television and streaming media as more OT services become available online. The availability of 4K video will drive bandwidth and throughput requirements even further.", "15713 A second key driver of network use is Cloud based application services and storage, both consumer and business focused. Use of web based productivity applications is likely to increase, led by Office 365 and Google apps, offering lower costs as compared to desktop alternatives. A number of enterprise tools in the style of salesforce.com, WebX, NetSuite, and SharePoint Online will drive bandwidth and latency expectations.", "15714 On the user side, there will be equivalent growth out from e commerce and social media platforms into Cloud backup and storage, health and education services, and various sorts of consumer self-service ranging from wedding planning to photo editing to tax preparation. We are increasingly seeing the Internet as the single conduit for all communication to the household, and indeed, to individuals themselves.", "15715 We agree that network uses such as these could probably accommodated by speed targets lower than those that we have recommended if relatively low latency inadequate and optimally uncapped bandwidth are included as metrics. We also believe that upload/download throughput symmetry will be increasingly important characteristics of service offerings in future.", "15716 Even if the CRTC were to mandate low latency and sufficient bandwidth for basic Internet service, the Forum still recommends setting a 100 megabit per second pan Canadian target by 2021 for two reasons.", "15717 First, a national commitment to 100 megabits will drive the development of Canada's entire Internet infrastructure. ISP capacity, of course, but backbone in transit Internet as well. This will create shorter routes between Canadian Internet access points, improve throughput, and increase the bandwidth of our national infrastructure.", "15718 Second, the consistent availability of 100 MIPS will also create an environment in which new and innovative network based services can be developed anywhere in Canada and be accessed by every Canadian. The precise affordances that will be provided by ubiquitous ultra-high-speed networks cannot be predicted accurately but the history of the Internet over the past 25 years suggests that as yet unimagined business and service models will emerge to benefit all Canadians economically, socially, and culturally.", "15719 Ultra high speed Internet will likely be a key component to future innovations around such emerging sectors as additive manufacturing, autonomous and unmanned vehicles in the Internet of Things, even though I hate using that term. As the Commission is aware, we see similar throughput targets in other jurisdictions.", "15720 Monica?", "15721 MS. AUER: Moving from the leading edge to the trailing edge, we would like to briefly raise the issue of payphones. Legacy technologies are often essential to certain groups of users even today and they are often economically and socially disadvantaged.", "15722 Such is the case with the payphone. Its use is declining rapidly as increasingly inexpensive and powerful mobile technologies become available.", "15723 But as the Forum\u2019s written submission noted, the removal of payphones disproportionately impacts people without either wireline or wireless telephone service, as well as potentially all Canadians during public emergencies or personal crises.", "15724 Payphone infrastructure need not be maintained as it has in the past, as New York City\u2019s public-private LinkNYC program demonstrates, by giving 7,500 payphone booths a 21st century makeover.", "15725 These booths are being converted into LinkNYC kiosks, each offering 45-metre radius high-speed WiFi, free domestic calling, a tablet to access maps, directions, and municipal services, and a red 911 call button for immediate access to emergency services.", "15726 The project also expects to earn $1 billion over 12 years through advertising, and to shrink the digital divide.", "15727 The Forum recommends that the Commission hold a proceeding to determine how low cost payphone-type services can ensure the availability of basic telecommunications services at fixed geographic points, while encouraging new, innovative, and accessible services that will replace the payphone infrastructure.", "15728 John?", "15729 MR. STEVENSON: There is obviously a very thin line between innovation and disruption.", "15730 Canadian decision-makers are still grappling with the challenges created by large multinational internet content and service providers such as Google and Netflix. These companies matter not just because of the content they provide, but because of how they deliver it, by building or leasing network infrastructure and servers in Canada.", "15731 These global hybrid platforms are the most disruptive players in current media and telecommunications environments.", "15732 Google, for example, is experimenting with high-altitude balloons to create an aerial wireless network with speeds up to LTE standards. Project Loon's balloons could be substantially cheaper than satellite, more flexible in terms of coverage, and with latency potentially well below 100 milliseconds.", "15733 OneWeb, who you heard from earlier, is another provider with relatively low latency, is proposing 640 satellites operating in low-earth orbit.", "15734 It is beyond the scope of this hearing to grapple with all the implications of this sort of disruption to Canada's communications environment. But at some point, we must determine if there is a place in Canada for OneWeb, Google Loon, and other emerging global internet broadband services in Canada to serve rural areas, and the near and far north.", "15735 Whether for that hearing or this one, the collection of data and ongoing monitoring by the CRTC are key to discussions about targets and they are already in discussions about affordability.", "15736 So thank you and we'd be happy to take any of your questions.", "15737 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. I\u2019ll put it the hands of the Vice-Chair.", "15738 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "15739 So the first thought I had when I saw the 100 megabits target was within the context of what we've been hearing the last couple of weeks about -- and in one of the presenters earlier today about trying to get that last 10 percent, trying to make sure all Canadians have access, the first thought I had was if you set a target of 100 megabits, do you know what's going to happen? Right?", "15740 Business is going to move to improve those services in Toronto, in Vancouver, in Montreal, in Calgary, and Edmonton, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and the gap between people who are still just asking us to get them from 1.5 to 5 and people who are already very well served in a lot of those major markets is just going to grow. And I'd like to have your perspective on that.", "15741 MR. STEVENSON: It's a particularly challenging project to go from in the past decades determining that, well, we want everyone to have a touchtone telephone service with 911 and this sort of thing. It's a very basic service and if they want to use long distance a lot, they can certainly pay for that.", "15742 And then trying to take a similar approach with internet access which has all sorts of different characteristics and uses. So finding that digital equivalent to a dial tone is very challenging because it brings in a number of different questions than simply basic telephone service.", "15743 So you can be concerned about people having basic access to websites and to email. You can be concerned about -- on the other end about businesses being able to have access to the latest web-based services. They may want to do their accounting on the web. They may want to do 3D printing remotely, various sorts of things.", "15744 So I think one thing that I've learned from the process over the last couple of weeks is that talking about having a minimum service that's accessible to somebody doesn't mean that that is the service that they have to take.", "15745 So we talk about 100 being available nationally, that doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t also focus on a minimum standard in other contexts for other sorts of users. So whether that's ---", "15746 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So you don\u2019t see 100 as the minimum standard?", "15747 MR. STEVENSON: It would be a minimum standard as a target for the bulk of the infrastructure in Canada. What we see in other jurisdictions with ---", "15748 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So just to go back to what I was trying to focus on ---", "15749 MR. STEVENSON: Okay.", "15750 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- was we are trying to -- one of the issues here is how do we get all Canadians to a minimum standard and in rural remote, in the north and First Nations communities, and that sort of stuff, those -- some might suggest those who are farthest behind might need the -- might be at the front of the cue when it comes to priorities.", "15751 Do you agree?", "15752 MR. STEVENSON: I do, yes.", "15753 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So would you agree that setting a 100 megabits standard now would not be the most helpful thing to them because it's just not possible right now for them?", "15754 MR. STEVENSON: Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t turn around and say that that's the -- that's the standard for 2017 and we picked the date of five years ---", "15755 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So where should we start and what should we start with a minimum? I mean the folks from OneWeb said, you know, you could just -- you don\u2019t have to make any judgment about usage but HD. You know, anything HD and above is enhanced and most people\u2019s basic needs can be met at 5 and 1, which is still a stretch for a lot of people.", "15756 MR. STEVENSON: Yeah, it is, it is. What we're seeing in other jurisdictions are fairly -- fairly ambitious targets around speed and in some cases the way that\u2019s structured depends on geography and you might say that we want to get 95 percent of people at 50 or at 25 in a certain period of time and the rest we want to make sure they have that 5 and 1 or 10 and 1.", "15757 And I think those approaches are -- they're perfectly acceptable. I think that that's -- there's nuance obviously to the challenges that we're looking at. I do think having an ambitious aspirational target for the longer term, maybe it's five years, maybe it's longer, is a good idea and it's not saying that everybody gets access to 100 and most people don\u2019t need 100.", "15758 But it's having that opportunity to access bandwidth and speed and latency that will allow innovation within the country longer term.", "15759 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. In your original submission, I think it was in the executive summary, you expressed concern that there were 125,000 households who cannot afford basic telecom services in Canada, but that was an estimate. I mean you were upfront about that and even keeping in mind that maybe there's 2 percent of the population that just chooses to live a disconnected life like that.", "15760 Anyway, your assumption, let's still go with that, that there are these people who can\u2019t have access to these basic services, how is setting a 100 megabit standard going to make their lives better?", "15761 MS. AUER: Before John adds something, I think you're quite right. There will always be Canadians who choose not to have access or choose not to be connected to the system. But they should at least have the opportunity to have it at some point.", "15762 And if the Commission can\u2019t at least stand in the way of setting a roadmap with phased-in targets perhaps for certain areas of the country, perhaps that would be the leadership that\u2019s required at this point.", "15763 John? ", "15764 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But, I mean, you understand how private enterprise works. That if you set these standards the money, the investment money, will flow to where it gets its -- because this how the world works. This is -- will go where it gets the quickest return on that investment.", "15765 MS. AUER: Well, I think ---", "15766 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So you\u2019re just going to broaden the gap.", "15767 MS. AUER: I think John may have a comment about what we were just speaking about, but I think the CRTC exists obviously is because there have been private marketplace failures in certain areas. And the Commission is expected by Parliament to try to remedy that to the best of its ability and authority.", "15768 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I agree.", "15769 MS. AUER: Right.", "15770 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I just don\u2019t understand how we would be doing that by setting a 100 megabits target.", "15771 MS. AUER: Well, we -- I think John also mentioned that we would not be setting a 100 megabit target for 2017.", "15772 John, did you want to deal with that?", "15773 MR. STEVENSON: Yeah. No, it\u2019s ---", "15774 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But, you know, I mean, 2021? You know, I mean, that\u2019s less than five years from now.", "15775 MR. STEVENSON: Right. Well, if it was 50 or 25 there would still be substantial challenges to bringing that level of bandwidth potentially to all Canadians. ", "15776 And I think that that -- I have no issues with phasing in that approach and a nuanced approached to how these services are deployed and who they\u2019re deployed to. There\u2019s no issue with that.", "15777 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, then where would we start?", "15778 MR. STEVENSON: Where should you start?", "15779 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Where would we start?", "15780 MR. STEVENSON: So in a -- there\u2019s, well, for the north, for example, the most challenging environment. There is -- I was just reading a report on northern broadband from the Public Policy Forum that was done a couple of years ago. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen that. But it\u2019s very challenging technologically, in fact, it\u2019s a unique challenge globally. ", "15781 I\u2019m of the opinion that you can -- someone can run fibre somehow up to the north, and then try to do a bunch of last mile deployments to different communities. Or it\u2019s more likely that a large-scale international player like OneWeb, or Google, or Facebook, or someone else who\u2019s doing some sort of experimental broadband project is more likely to come in and provide that sort of service.", "15782 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks. Just in terms of the basic standards then, I understand your 100; what about data allowance?", "15783 MR. STEVENSON: People should be able to purchase unlimited data, if possible.", "15784 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, they can now.", "15785 MR. STEVENSON: Yeah. Yeah, but they\u2019re should ---", "15786 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But what should be the minimum standard?", "15787 MR. STEVENSON: I would say in terms of a short-term, like, a near-term standard, I would expect 20, 25 symmetrical upload/download, less than 100 millisecond latency, and then the ability to purchase unlimited data.", "15788 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So when your target you\u2019re proposing of 100, you\u2019re proposing an upload speed of 100 megabits per second download.", "15789 MR. STEVENSON: One-hundred (100) for sure.", "15790 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So what should be the upload?", "15791 MR. STEVENSON: Not everyone needs to purchase symmetrical. And if you look at retail broadband packages, there\u2019s all sorts of different options.", "15792 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: If they did people would be selling them, yeah?", "15793 MR. STEVENSON: Right, yeah. Yeah. ", "15794 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But what is your take on what the upload speed should be?", "15795 MR. STEVENSON: It\u2019s a bit, I mean, a lot of customers don\u2019t require large upload if they\u2019re mostly ---", "15796 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Just give me a number.", "15797 MR. STEVENSON: For 100? Ten (10).", "15798 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "15799 MR. STEVENSON: Yeah. ", "15800 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And latency?", "15801 MR. STEVENSON: Well, less than 100 but with fibre that\u2019s not an issue.", "15802 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "15803 MR. STEVENSON: Yeah. ", "15804 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Your original submission spoke quite a bit, expressed a lot of concern for the people on the downside of Canada\u2019s advantages. And we\u2019ve seen -- had considerable submissions on those points too.", "15805 But aren\u2019t those matters of poverty best addressed by provincial and territorial social service agencies whose job it is to do that? As I put it to those other folks, we\u2019re not social workers, we\u2019re not childcare workers, in terms of assessing people\u2019s basic needs like that. Should we not leave that to the people who have not only the constitutional responsibility to provide it directly through Social Services, but also most important in a sense the expertise?", "15806 MS. AUER: Well, I think it\u2019s interesting to frame a telecommunications accessibility and affordability issue as a poverty issue. But under the Telecom Act, Parliament gave the CRTC a mandate which requires it under Section 7 to deal with user social and economic requirements. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a poverty requirement. I think if Parliament had thought that the provinces and municipalities should deal with access as a poverty matter they wouldn\u2019t have required Section 7(h).", "15807 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. So if we provide a subsidy to low-income people then the departments of Social Services in those provinces take a look at that and say, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re getting -- it\u2019s worth $40 a month. We\u2019re going to scratch that back and your Social Services, your Welfare payment goes down by that.\u201d", "15808 MS. AUER: I think that\u2019s ---", "15809 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: How much good has happened there?", "15810 MS. AUER: Well, that\u2019s a speculative idea and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to worry about the provinces\u2019 Social Welfare departments and how they decide ---", "15811 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, I think it\u2019s within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to worry about the efficient use of public funds. I think that\u2019s very much a responsibility of that. Just moving money around that doesn\u2019t end up doing any benefit to the people that you\u2019re ---", "15812 MS. AUER: Well, it would benefit people if they actually had access to affordable high-speed broadband. And also, basic payphones, which we have continually harped upon.", "15813 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. On payphones, I take it -- oh, and by the way, thank you for your concern for our process and critique of it. It\u2019s been duly noted.", "15814 On payphones, I take it that most of your concerns in your original submission were covered off by -- and I don\u2019t need to get into a long discussion about payphones -- by 2015 545?", "15815 MS. AUER: Our concern in our submission in that proceeding was that not all payphones should simply be allowed to be removed. And although the Commission has ---", "15816 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. I\u2019m ---", "15817 MS. AUER: --- now introduced a notification requirement that formalizes notification in most circumstances, that doesn\u2019t albeit change the fact that now all payphones can be removed.", "15818 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sure. And ---", "15819 MS. AUER: We don\u2019t support that.", "15820 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- I\u2019m not re-discussing that. I\u2019m concerned -- it was the concerns you expressed in this proceeding in your original submission regarding payphones. Are they still on the table or are they ---", "15821 MS. AUER: Yes.", "15822 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- are off the table? They\u2019re still on the table? Okay, thank you. ", "15823 And on the -- you reference to the advancements in New York regarding the use of payphone stations. I had this thought, and you can dispossess me of it. I\u2019ve seen something in London, U.K. as well. And, like, as you said, it brings in $1 billion worth of revenue and that. ", "15824 But if you put London and New York together, in a relatively small space you have most of Canada. So as Canada\u2019s urban markets grows, wouldn\u2019t this sort of thing just develop?", "15825 MR. STEVENSON: Hopefully, yes, they will develop.", "15826 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "15827 MR. STEVENSON: And in New York City it\u2019s a city initiative that\u2019s been taken up by industry. It\u2019s a public private partnership that has just started rolling out. So some version of that model may be just an internet kiosk or what have you. It\u2019s still early days for that.", "15828 MS. AUER: And of course the Commission did deregulate payphones in the late 1990s with the hope that private sector enterprise would step in to replace payphones that other companies might remove, the incumbents might remove. There\u2019s very little data on it of course, but it didn\u2019t seem to be a perfect one-to-one replacement, so to speak.", "15829 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "15830 In your submission you suggested that -- you referred to the \u201ccomplete availability of wireless service\u201d. I wanted to clarify, when you say \u201ccomplete\u201d, how complete do you mean? ", "15831 It\u2019s a -- executive summary, paragraph 4. ", "15832 MS. AUER: Thank you. ", "15833 I don\u2019t know if John wants to comment on that, but I think what we were looking at was the original 2011 statement by the Commission where it had hoped to see 100 percent availability of 5 in 1 by now. ", "15834 So we agreed that all of these aspirational targets if you will ---", "15835 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Actually this was in reference to wireless.", "15836 MS. AUER: Okay, well ---", "15837 You could refresh our memory, which paragraph are you looking at in the executive summary?", "15838 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Executive summary, paragraph 4. ", "15839 MS. AUER: Paragraph 4. ", "--- (A SHORT PAUSE)", "15840 MR. STEVENSON: Maybe we could clarify that with you. ", "15841 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, because it\u2019s ---", "15842 MS. AUER: Executive summary, paragraph 4?", "15843 MR. STEVENSON: If that\u2019s all right. ", "15844 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s what I have written down. Oh, it\u2019s the 14th of July. ", "15845 Or -- hang on a second. Yes, it\u2019s the 14th of --- ", "15846 MS. AUER: I", "15847 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, it\u2019s the 14th of July. ", "15848 MR. STEVENSON: Would you be able to read the sentence? ", "15849 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You only had one; right?", "15850 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, yes. ", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "15851 MS. AUER: I was like I know, but we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re looking at it. We don\u2019t see it. ", "15852 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I may have misplaced it. ", "15853 Okay, well let\u2019s just skip that, because I don\u2019t want to waste time digging it up and it\u2019s not that vital to the process anyway. ", "15854 You also indicated that you wanted in order to fill the gaps, to close the gaps, you indicated that governments should take action and I wanted to know what sort of action you are proposing that government should take?", "15855 MR. STEVENSON: I think it\u2019s fairly clear coming out of this process and the Chair has noted it that Canada requires connectivity, a broadband strategy that in -- that involves all levels of government. ", "15856 The CRTC has a part to play in that, but not the only part. By setting minimum standards for connectivity that this will hopefully feed into a broader process. ", "15857 And the components of that kind of approach have to include connectivity in the near and far north, and in rural and remote areas, as you know, and that\u2019s going to require some unique solutions that will be only applicable in Canada, I would expect, technologically. ", "15858 MS. AUER: And as part of those solutions I think the Commission has a key role to play in obtaining data to describe progress going forward on a steady, annual basis, if not semi-annual.", "15859 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. ", "15860 So you also express concern about telcos\u2019 profitability and I\u2019m trying to understand what sort of framework you propose instead. ", "15861 I\u2019m trying to understand how the Commission taking action to reduce the profitability of telcos enhances Canada\u2019s telecom infrastructure and gets to 100 megabits per second in less than five years.", "15862 MS. AUER: I think the comments that we made on profitability were to highlight the point that we\u2019re not dealing with companies that lack resources. ", "15863 The companies, most of the incumbents, have sufficient resources that they could afford to do more, but they don\u2019t have to. They\u2019re not required to and that is our only point. ", "15864 And with respect to the idea that if telcos\u2019 profitability is reduced the telecommunications infrastructure in Canada is damaged. I\u2019m not sure I would agree with that syllogism, if it\u2019s a syllogism. ", "15865 I would say instead, if the trade-off is that telco profitability might drop one or two points and service to Canadians improved that might be a useful trade-off.", "15866 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But the barrier right now to the -- getting access to the last 10 percent -- and, you know, a lot of small entrepreneurs, you know, in -- at the end of the large telco road, have done a very good job of building out and building out, but then we\u2019ve kind of got to the end of that and so we\u2019re down to the last 10 percent.", "15867 And the reason they have -- people aren\u2019t spending to connect is because there is no economic case to do so; right? And it\u2019s not just the build but there\u2019s no revenue to be had at the end of it. ", "15868 It\u2019s economically -- and that doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t have social purpose, but economically, in terms of the role that the private sector can play, it\u2019s -- they\u2019re not there because there\u2019s nothing there in terms of -- in terms of a return and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get to.", "15869 Is not that the role where government should finance, as opposed to just reducing telcos\u2019 profitability?", "15870 MS. AUER: So on the one hand for recent telco ---", "15871 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Which is likely to come out of jobs and less service elsewhere. ", "15872 MS. AUER: Well in terms of reducing telcos\u2019 profitability, the idea is that you trade-off some expenditures from telcos\u2019 for improved service for the rest of Canadians who presumably would benefit. ", "15873 So there might be well more jobs coming out of that benefit from that slight reduction and it doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not a permanent reduction. I can\u2019t imagine it would be permanent.", "15874 As for the notion that there is no revenue to be obtained from the last 10 percent, I think there is revenue to be obtained. It may not be of sufficient scale, it may not be in the 25 to 30 percent area, but there may well be revenue to cover costs. ", "15875 And so the issue becomes at what point do we say all right now you\u2019re operating in a loss and we\u2019re happy as a government, whether it\u2019s a municipal, provincial, or federal, or territorial government, whatever, to perhaps compensate you for that cost. Either through the Income Tax Act or through other means perhaps the high cost service areas ---", "15876 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right, but that\u2019s not how publicly traded companies work. They don\u2019t --- ", "15877 MS. AUER: Well Bell Canada has been working that way for many years. ", "15878 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: If you -- if you\u2019ve reduced their profitability they have to get it back, because that\u2019s why -- that\u2019s ---", "15879 I\u2019m not defending it; I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s how it works; right?", "15880 So if you reduce their profitability by making them to do -- forcing them to do things that are uneconomic without subsidy of some kind, they will reduce service levels elsewhere, or reduce jobs, or increase prices, more than likely. ", "15881 So those are all not outcomes that most people would be looking for, so I\u2019m just trying to understand how your proposal makes a better telecommunications infrastructure for most Canadians.", "15882 MS. AUER: I think Canadians interests are better served when everyone in Canada has access to 21st century communications technology. ", "15883 And if that can be achieved by requiring telcos, incumbents, for instance, to expend money on the last 10 percent, I think that\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. ", "15884 And certainly other countries such as Finland and Australia are attempting to do precisely that. ", "15885 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: With a great deal of government investment, that\u2019s what I was trying to get at.", "15886 MS. AUER: The idea that companies can never lose -- I mean are we really saying that their profitability must be guaranteed?", "15887 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, when you work at one that\u2019s how it works. ", "15888 MS. AUER: But do -- does ---", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "15889 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s just -- that\u2019s just how the world works. ", "15890 MS. AUER: But we don\u2019t work at one and ----", "15891 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or anything.", "15892 MS. AUER: Okay but ---", "15893 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But it is just how the world works. ", "15894 MS. AUER: All right, but the CRTC is not a company and that\u2019s not its role, to defend the profit structures of companies. Its role is to implement the objectives --", "15895 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, but it is -- it is its role to understand reality. ", "15896 MS. AUER: -- of parliament. ", "15897 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right? And try to deal with that. So that\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re -- we have different desired outcomes. It\u2019s just -- I\u2019m just trying to understand how your path leads to the best outcome. ", "15898 MS. AUER: I think it leads to a better outcome for more people.", "15899 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks. Those are my questions. ", "15900 THE CHAIRPERSON: Apparently those -- sorry.

HOLMES: Pierre is going to start us off and in French.", "15947 M. ALLARD: Nous sommes tr\u00e8s heureux d'avoir l'occasion de vous pr\u00e9senter nos opinions sur les questions qui sont au c\u0153ur de cette importante instance, et parler au nom de tous les Canadiens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9s par les grandes entreprises de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications. ", "15948 Les trois points essentiels que nous tenons \u00e0 exprimer avec vous aujourd'hui sont: 1, les Canadiens ont besoin de vitesses de large bande \u00e0 10/3 pour participer de fa\u00e7on significative dans l\u2019\u00e9conomie num\u00e9rique; 2, la subvention actuelle pour le service t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique demeure toujours n\u00e9cessaire pour supporter l\u2019acc\u00e8s des Canadiens en r\u00e9gions rurales \u00e0 des services fiables, abordables, de haute qualit\u00e9 l\u00e0 o\u00f9 ils demeurent; et 3, nous devons rehausser les mesures r\u00e9glementaires existantes pour mettre en place une strat\u00e9gie nationale de large bande afin d\u2019assurer qu\u2019aucun canadien ne sera oubli\u00e9.", "15949 En premier lieu, les Canadiens requi\u00e8rent des vitesses d\u2019acc\u00e8s internet sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 5/1 m\u00e9gabits/seconde. L\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019internet \u00e0 large bande est devenu l\u2019enjeu principal dans cette instance. Nous notons par ailleurs le commentaire de quelques jours pass\u00e9s du Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil qui confirmait que le CRTC consid\u00e8re d\u00e9j\u00e0 le service internet \u00e0 large bande comme un service de base pour tous les Canadiens.", "15950 Cependant, partant de ce constat, la position des parties diverge radicalement. Il est tr\u00e8s surprenant que les grandes entreprises de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de la pr\u00e9sente instance pr\u00e9tendent qu'un service de 5/1 m\u00e9gabits/seconde est ce qui devrait faire l\u2019affaire de tous les Canadiens. Mais en m\u00eame temps, ces grands transporteurs sont orient\u00e9s sur les march\u00e9s urbains dens\u00e9ment peupl\u00e9s o\u00f9 ils offrent des services dans la plage de 100 m\u00e9gabits de t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement et plus. ", "15951 L\u2019\u00e9norme diff\u00e9rence entre ce qu'ils vendent en ville compar\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'ils proposent dans le cadre de cette instance est \u00e9tourdissante. N\u00e9anmoins ce n\u2019est pas \u00e9tonnant dans un contexte o\u00f9 la grande majorit\u00e9 de leurs revenus est produite en milieu urbain. Nous concluons qu'un service de 5/1 m\u00e9gabits n'est tout simplement pas suffisant pour aujourd'hui, et encore moins pour demain. ", "15952 MS. LAWRENCE: In order to illustrate this conclusion, we\u2019d like you to recall what the Commission said in its last Obligation to Serve Decision when it established the current aspirational target. Canadians should have access to a service that allows several users in one household to use the World Wide Web to see alpha-numeric text, images and small video files and other online services such as email and banking all over a single connection at the same time. And broadband internet should allow a single user to stream higher-quality video and audio, and to participate in video conferencing at reasonable quality using online services.", "15953 Just reading this list aloud highlights how much the world has changed in the past five years. The internet and the possibilities it creates has exploded since 2011. And yet, it is precisely the same connection speeds that the large telecom companies are arguing for in this proceeding. They are telling you that yesterday\u2019s speeds are okay for tomorrow. We strongly disagree.", "15954 The Let\u2019s Talk Broadband Findings Report noted that in the representative survey, 62 percent of Canadians reported dissatisfaction with internet speeds of less than 5 megabits. And furthermore, that dissatisfaction with internet speeds is twice as likely in rural areas. ", "15955 The JTF is proposing that the Commission move beyond its current aspirational target of 5/1, and take the next logical and technologically-feasible step to mandate that as many Canadians as possible should have access to a wireline service that actually delivers 10 meg down and 3 meg up to consumers. ", "15956 The required network improvements should be implemented over the next three years. Following that, and on a regular basis, the Commission should review how Canadians are actually using the Internet to ensure that any basic Internet package keeps up with what Canadians need to actively participate in the digital economy.", "15957 Donovan?", "15958 MR. DIAS: Our second key point is that the current voice subsidy is still needed to support rural Canadians' access to reliable, affordable and high quality services where they live. We don't want the Commission to lose sight of this important issue. The subsidy that supports the provision of voice services in rural high cost exchanges continues to be an important pillar of fulfilling the fundamental policy objectives of the Telecom Act and protecting the interests of rural Canadians.", "15959 The list of carriers that actually operate under the obligation to serve and the basic service objective is a small subset of the parties to this proceeding. Even though we operate under the same OTS and BSO requirements, the JTF members represented by this panel are very small operators compared to the likes of Bell, Telus, SaskTel and MTS.", "15960 Moreover, our territories are in 100 percent high cost serving areas with no large urban centres against which we can cross-subsidize. As such, we are far more sensitive to the status of the voice subsidy than a company like Bell.", "15961 Subsidy has always been linked to the obligation to serve. As private sector companies, SILECs are largely driven by financial considerations with a social policy overlay.", "15962 We remain prepared to operate under the OTS, provided there are no unfunded obligations. On the other hand, as service providers who live and work in our local communities, we know that the obligation to serve and the local subsidy has been an important tool to ensure that Canadians in high cost serving areas have access to affordable telephone service.", "15963 So we look at this issue through both a business lens and a public policy lens at the same time. Remembering that all of our exchanges are in Bands E and F, if you eliminate the local telephone subsidy in these bands, as suggested by some parties, then in fairness, you would also have to remove the obligation to serve.", "15964 Rural Canadians would then be faced with paying 100 percent of the cost to acquire and maintain service, putting at risk access to service for vulnerable rural Canadians, many of whom do not have access to dependable or reliable alternatives. All but one of the large ILECs continue to support the current voice subsidy in Bands E and F and so do we.", "15965 Ian?", "15966 MR. STEVENS: Our final key point is that as a nation we can't afford to leave some Canadians behind when it comes to broadband access. We must build on existing regulatory measures to implement a national broadband strategy.", "15967 Our video paints a picture of the customers in our high cost serving areas. There are only a few areas in our operating territories where the Commission's current broadband target levels are not available. The same cannot be said in neighbouring areas just beyond the reach of our wireline networks where the only options some Canadians have is a wireless service or a dialup service. Your earlier conversation with the ward councillor for Milton comes to mind as an example of this.", "15968 Our position is that wireless is a stopgap that will only work for a period of time. We believe that five years from now parties will be back before the Commission advocating basic service speeds at 100 megabits per second, far beyond the sustainable capability of wireless. We urge you to not invest in technologies that won't go the distance.", "15969 In a Let's Talk broadband report, rural Canadians described in a variety of ways that poor Internet service has impacted their daily lives. One of the most common complaints is that the price paid in rural areas is higher than in urban areas for what is viewed as inferior service.", "15970 The report also identified that many rural Canadians are limited in what they can do online. Rural Canadians have lost time, lost income, and lost opportunities. Rural participants talked about the many things that would change in their lives for the better if they had better Internet access, not the least of which is education.", "15971 Your latest Communication Monitoring report states that 80 percent of Canadian households can subscribe to a 5/1 Internet access service today. Based on our experience, the broadband business case for the industry stops at non densely populated areas where DSL and cable wireline networks currently end.", "15972 Without a national broadband strategy to address the absence of a business case, rational private sector companies will not expand their networks into underserved areas. To encourage further expansion and evolution into non dense areas, an ongoing subsidy is required.", "15973 By focusing only on the 4 percent of Canadians who are unserved, the large ILECs and cable companies are misrepresenting and understating the problem. The real problem the Commission needs to focus on exists within the 20 percent of households, up to 7 million Canadians, many of whom live beyond the reach of 5/1 wireline broadband networks.", "15974 Here's what we're proposing to improve the situation. Rob?", "15975 MR. PETRUK: Where are these households? Referencing the maps we filed February 1st and that we've included in these comments this morning, by combining the 80 percent wireline coverage statistics from the latest CMR with ISAID systems of hexagons, we've identified the densely populated areas that contain 80 percent of the population in green hexagons.", "15976 We're proposing broadband subsidy eligibility be restricted to the group of red hexagons containing the remaining 20 percent of the population, those Canadians in non densely populated rural and remote areas, not just in the extreme North. We've identified how you can leverage your existing regulatory mechanisms to collect the needed funds and pay for the rollout of broadband in non densely populated areas.", "15977 Most of our member companies have spent more than 100 years serving rural Canadians customers. We live and work in rural and remote areas. It is no surprise to us that we are the only group of carriers in this proceeding that has provided you with a workable blueprint to bring dependable, wireline-based, high speed broadband to those rural Canadians who really need it. Our February submission went into considerable detail on our proposal.", "15978 To conclude our presentation, we would like to reiterate our three key points:", "15979 Canadians require broadband access at 3/10 to meaningfully participate in the digital economy; the current voice subsidy still needed to be -- the current voice subsidy is still needed to support rural Canadians' access to reliable, affordable, and high quality service where they live; and we must build on existing regulatory measures to implement a national broadband strategy to ensure that no Canadians are left behind.", "15980 MR. HOLMES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Commissioners. We would be pleased to answer any questions that you might have.", "15981 And I'd also like to point out, just before, and state for the record that three of our panel members are CEOs of their companies. If not directly indicated by their titles, they are, nonetheless, heads of their businesses and have invested heavily in preparing for their appearance today. Thank you.", "15982 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, you said it ahead of me. I had noticed that, that we had CEOs, and of course, the Commission always appreciates. It doesn't have to be CEOs of the largest companies in the country; they're still the leadership of the telecommunication industry. And when the Commission has an important hearing, it's nice to see people showing up at the highest level, so it's quite good.", "15983 Monsieur Allard, je veux juste sp\u00e9cifier que je ne crois pas que j\u2019ai dit que le service internet \u00e9tait un service de base, \u00e7a c'est une question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider encore. Je crois que le mot que j\u2019ai utilis\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00ab vital \u00bb. Et puis -- donc on continuera \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les enjeux parce que \u00e9videmment le dossier n\u2019est pas ferm\u00e9.", "15984 Je vais vous mettre entre les mains de mon coll\u00e8gue, Monsieur le vice-pr\u00e9sident Menzies.", "15985 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Good morning.", "15986 They're already here asking for 100 megabits per second basic service, so on that point---", "15987 So what does 10 and 3 that 5 and 1 doesn't?", "15988 MR. DIAS: So one of the reasons why we thought that 10 and 3 should be mandated, based on Internet, growth trends, and as we knew them back in 2011, 5/1 was a good enough target to set at the time. But with the rampant exponential growth of Internet based applications today, the need for higher speeds is certainly growing at a rapid pace.", "15989 So far in this proceeding, we've heard many TSPs say that 5/1 is good enough, but at the same time, we heard them also say that some of their most popular packages are their 10 megs or their 15 megs service. And they offer much higher speeds than some of their other urban areas.", "15990 On the flip side, we've heard consumer groups talk about 5/1 not being good enough for them, and if they had access to more than that, that's something that they certainly require and will enhance their lives in the way they go about their business on the Internet.", "15991 From what we've seen on our networks, we -- we're more inclined to agree with the consumer groups because that's what we hear some of our customers asking us for. So we are proposing the 10 and 3 as we feel that these are the speeds that Canadians truly need to participate in the digital economy.", "15992 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, that's -- just to go back on that, it's one of the issues that we struggle with, because we're trying to define a basic service. And if the market demand is driving it higher, that's great, right, but it's one of those wants versus needs. So if we're trying to make sure basic needs are met, which---", "15993 So I'm wondering, do you anticipate with the 10 and 3, that things such as government services, websites, et cetera, would be getting more sophisticated, would be offering more video or something that would make access to some of these basic needs difficult for people if they only had a 5 and 1 service so it would have to be -- I mean, I\u2019m all in favour of being aspirational. But at the same time, we have to be careful that if we\u2019re talking subsidy that we\u2019re not subsidizing companies to build something that the market would drive them to anyway, as opposed to subsidizing something that gives the people the foundation and then the companies the foundation if they wish to go beyond.", "15994 MS. LAWRENCE: I think one of the things that we talked about when we were trying to come up with what our recommended speed was, and something that we see at my company all the time, is the -- while 1 individual government website may very well not exceed the 5/1, when you look at adding in 1 child or 2 child -- children trying to do homework in an evening and a parent trying to access government websites, access banking, all those other important functions, you suddenly find that 5/1 is not anywhere near enough for that basic residential home anywhere throughout Canada.", "15995 The other thing I\u2019m reminded of as I\u2019m sitting in my office and I hear our help desk trying to resolve people\u2019s problems, accessing the Internet is -- and we discussed it last night even, how the Internet is always a two-way street. Even if I am requesting download information, I am -- in order to request that information, I need to send out a request to find it. So if all of the -- if the one upload, one meg upload is -- sorry, if the five meg download is maxed out, there is no way I can get out to request another website.", "15996 MR. HOLMES: And I\u2019ll just add, there is an interesting letter filed on the record of the proceeding from Health Canada. It was from the Deputy Minister. And it said the use of Telehealth continues to grow significantly. The total number of clinical Telehealth sessions, many of which I\u2019m understanding include some video conferencing aspects, increase from 45.7 from -- increase 45.7 percent from 2012 to 2014. So that was a jump of 282,000 sessions to 411,000 sessions. So we just see the demand just continuing to grow.", "15997 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you. And that sort of segues to the next point, which is about data usage minimums in terms of that because if you\u2019re talking children doing homework, et cetera, et cetera, that\u2019s been an issue that\u2019s come to our attention. So do you have a view on that that if there\u2019s a -- that that would be part of a basic service designation? And if so, what would be an appropriate?", "15998 MR. DIAS: So this was not something that we\u2019d put in writing earlier on in the proceeding, but we certainly talked about it as a group, as well as amongst our members. And we are suggesting that 25 gigs as a data cap would be sufficient to include in the basic service objective. ", "15999 It\u2019s -- I think when Canadians use the Internet to do things like eHealth and ecommerce and job searches and things like that, 25 gigs covers it. ", "16000 I was talking to Serge and one of the things that Coop Tel does is they monitor their customer usage. The average customer on their networks using about 45 to 46 gigabytes per month. And when we were looking at our network usage, about 50, if not slightly higher, is being used for entertainment purposes, such as Netflix or online gaming. So when we put those two numbers together, we came up with 25 gigs for essential services as a data cap.", "16001 MR. HOLMES: And when we were thinking about this at the beginning of the proceeding, you know, we -- one of the things we want to avoid as regulatory people is getting out of scope and making sure we stay in scope in the proceeding. So the original notice of consultation talked about specifically the digital economy. I think it kind of hinted at what the definition was and we recalled the Chair\u2019s comments as well first day that this is about a wants versus needs. So that was -- I think that all fed into our cap size that we\u2019re proposing.", "16002 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you.", "16003 You mentioned -- okay. In terms of basic service standards, you\u2019ve mentioned capacity. You mentioned speed. You also mentioned latency. Was there anything else?", "16004 MR. PETRUK: Not necessarily. I think what we were looking to put forward is that any service that we provide should come with a set of standards mandated by the CRTC to ensure that the -- all Canadians are receiving a reliable service. We did say that latency should be 100 milliseconds. We said that jitter at a standard resting rate should be no more than five milliseconds. And that availability should be 99.999 percent of the time for any service given to a Canadian.", "16005 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. In terms of the latency standards, as you mentioned, your number was 100 milliseconds. Do you see this as applying to the network or an end to end measure?", "16006 MR. PETRUK: Actually, the way that we viewed it was that for residential service, the services should be provisioned and installed to meet that standard. And then if the customer calls in with a repair, they should be repaired to bring them back up to that standard if they\u2019re falling for any reason.", "16007 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. And would it be the same standard for all technologies, including satellite?", "16008 MR. PETRUK: It should be to ensure reliable service for all.", "16009 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you.", "16010 Now in terms of the obligation to serve, your position is that it should be imposed for broadband on all LECs, BILECs and SILECs. And then only if they are unwilling or unable to meet that obligation would other service providers be eligible for subsidy; correct?", "16011 MR. ALLARD: First of all, our position has evolved over time as we ---", "16012 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, now all my questions are going to have to change.", "16013 MR. ALLARD: At this point we acknowledge that there really is no incumbent for broadband service, contrary to telephony service, where the subsidy was given to the ILEC with the obligation to serve according to the BSO. So in the broadband world, there really is no incumbent.", "16014 So what we\u2019re suggesting is that we should focus not on an exchange basis as is for telephony, it\u2019s much more on a per household basis. Because within a given exchange there might be just a few households that don\u2019t have access to broadband services that meet the BSO. And so therefore, what we\u2019re proposing and what we discussed in the February submission is that we\u2019d focus on the hexagons that have only 20 percent of the population. ", "16015 And within those hexagons, we\u2019re not suggesting that all of the households would be eligible for subsidy. What we\u2019re suggesting is that we would have to look at each specific household. If there is at least -- if there are at least two providers for a given household that is able to provide service at that household that would been the BSO, then we\u2019re suggesting that there\u2019s no subsidy that should be payable. And the reason for that is that just market pressures; right? Every competitor will want to keep pace with the other. And so therefore, as the Commission changes the BSO over time that\u2019s it quite reasonable to expect that the providers will match whatever is required for competitive reasons.", "16016 If there is only a single service provider that is addressing that particular household, we are, in fact, suggesting that there should be some subsidy for that particular provider for that household, essentially on a per-NAS basis, if you wish.", "16017 And the reason for that is that we want to ensure long-term sustainability. So as the requirements for broadband evolve over time, then that service provider will be able to evolve his network and ensure that the service continues to meet the BSO.", "16018 Finally, if there is absolutely no service provider addressing that particular household, then we\u2019re simply suggesting that it comes on a first-come, first-served basis. ", "16019 So we are not suggesting, for example, that the SILECs should get the subsidy. If a cable company or, for that matter, a wireless provider who was able to meet the BSO with the quality of service objectives and such, then fine, that particular party should be eligible for the subsidy.", "16020 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. But that\u2019s where -- it\u2019s in that transition where I got a little lost in terms of what happened to the obligation to serve, which is fine, if it simply doesn\u2019t apply to broadband, that\u2019s fine, as your position. But what about that final household, I guess, is what we were talking about, because the rest of the transition is really just a market forces competitive pressure access and that sort of stuff. That's how I understood it would end up serving those people but it was still the person at the very end of the last mile where nobody was there. How do we -- because that's kind of, in a broad sense, where we're at with the system. How do we make sure they get service?", "16021 MR. ALLARD: That is one position that the JTF has not changed on. So what we're saying is that we are in fact willing to take on an obligation to serve.", "16022 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "16023 MR. ALLARD: According to BSO, but there should be no unfunded obligation. So in other words, if we need to get further than where we are today to address that remaining household down the road, we're willing to do it if there is a subsidy to do it.", "16024 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, but that's where the LEC becomes responsible. Is that correct?", "16025 MR. ALLARD: Any service -- as I mentioned a while ago, any service provider ---", "16026 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Any service provider willing to ---", "16027 MR. ALLARD: To take on ---", "16028 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- to take it on and go with the subsidy and that would be ---", "16029 MR. ALLARD: And take on the obligations to do it.", "16030 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And that would be determined by what method? Just first one to put up their hand?", "16031 MR. ALLARD: If there are no service providers that are able to address that particular household today, then yes, if there's one to come in and say I'm willing to take it on, willing to provide service that matches the BSO requirement and therefore I'm eligible for the subsidy, I should also have the obligation to serve that particular household.", "16032 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And that would most likely be the incumbent.", "16033 MR. ALLARD: It could be the incumbent. I'm not suggesting that it would be in all cases. I'm suggesting though that we are willing to take on that challenge in our territories.", "16034 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So just to clarify for me, somebody living down the end of that road contacts us and says, \u201cI can't find anybody to give me internet. I phoned here, here and here and nobody will -- nobody will come out and do it.\u201d What do we tell them?", "16035 MR. ALLARD: Essentially then it becomes on a first-come, first-served basis. There may be cases where, for whatever reason, the SILEC is not able to do it either. So maybe then there's a wireless provider that is willing to step up to the plate and say I can do it, but he's got to take on the obligation to serve and he's got to be able to serve according to the BSO requirement.", "16036 It is not sufficient to say, for example, \u201cI can give you 5/1 but hey, by the way, there's traffic management practices. There's going to be additional delay. There's going to be additional jitter, and so on and so forth.\u201d", "16037 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I'm just getting a little lost -- I mean not lost there but I'm just trying to figure out how that works for that person down the end of the road because we need to be able to -- I mean if we're telling people this is part of the basic service and all Canadians should get in, when somebody phones, we should be able to say, \u201cOkay, what you need to do is phone this guy. He's the guy who can take it on.\u201d Or we can say, \u201cYou know, you have to phone the satellite provider or whatever, or wireless.\u201d But there needs to be a path that's evident to the consumer Canadian on that.", "16038 MR. HOLMES: I\u2019m not sure if we have a clear path from our proposal but what we're proposing is that if there's subsidy attached, monthly subsidy attached to serving that end customer, then this subsidy will hopefully close the business case that a service provider in the area requires to actually extend their network out to that end customer. So the subsidy is really the incentive to go after that customer for the service providers.", "16039 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I see. Okay.", "16040 So that was with broadband but with land lines, you still want the obligation to serve to exist and the subsidy to exist for telephone?", "16041 MR. HOLMES: Yes, we do. We've heard what MTS and SaskTel have said on this issue and we think they provided great responses in response to the continued need for subsidy and OTS and we agree with them.", "16042 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So in terms of subsidy, a person living in a household who wants a telephone and would have subsidized internet, would they be able to get -- choose between one or the other? I mean it's a line going into the house, right, or would they get -- or would the service provider be able to get subsidy for providing both?", "16043 MS. LAWRENCE: I think the service provider, if the customer took both services, would be able to get subsidy for both. It may not be the same service provider as Pierre was speaking to but both of those services would have their costs of providing service defined according to a Phase II process.", "16044 So there would be no duplication in funding of the costs to provide service. They would be two very -- two distinct services with their own set of costs inherent in them.", "16045 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So if services can be provided in bundles at discounts by companies, why can't subsidy be provided in bundles for multiple services at a discount, at less cost to the subsidizer?", "16046 MS. LAWRENCE: I think the reason there is that the costs related to those services determined by a Phase II process is very specific and does not include excess margin that can be reduced through a bundling process. And again, there is always the possibility that it could be two different service providers.", "16047 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. And I don\u2019t think to -- yes, but the question was ram-bundling but you've answered it. That's fine.", "16048 So assuming there's still role for phone directories, what kind of information should they contain? Mobile phone numbers for instance? Or is there a role for them? I mean assuming ---", "16049 MS. LAWRENCE: We definitely think there is still a role for paper phone directories to ensure service access to those customers that don\u2019t have any other means or that prefer to have a paper phone directory.", "16050 As far as including cellular numbers or mobile numbers in the directory, it's not something we specifically considered but my opinion would be that we would not include those because of individual preference and wanting to maintain privacy of their mobile numbers.", "16051 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. As you've noted in your submissions and again today, Bell says telephone subsidies are no longer required in Bands E&F and Shaw said the same. Others disagreed with them, including you quite strongly.", "16052 So the question is not so much -- I guess it is. Would you like to expand on that a little and within the context of isn't this something that's going to have to happen sooner or later?", "16053 I mean if we're anticipating all these changes in the future and we're building basic broadband standards that are trying to anticipate the future, shouldn\u2019t we be trying to anticipate the future of land lines which doesn't appear to be eternal and starting a transition out of that? I mean why would we be funding 19th century technology as opposed to shouldn't we be focusing on 21st century?", "16054 MR. HOLMES: Hereto, we heard what MTS and SaskTel argued on this point and we agree but I would add that I think we all can see that the voice -- the wireline voice trend and the numbers trending down, the issue is we don\u2019t know what its ultimate fate is right now. So we don\u2019t know whether it's going to go right down to zero or whether it's going to level off at some level and what that level would be. So we don\u2019t know the future.", "16055 What we also know is that -- and the Let\u2019s Talk Broadband Task Force Report also informed us that in rural Canada, at least 88 percent of rural Canadians still have a home phone service. That's a pretty substantial number.", "16056 I know that the national statistic in terms of people that have left wireline home phone behind is probably significantly higher than that but that 88 percent is still a large number.", "16057 So in rural Canada high-cost serving areas, it's our position that it's too early to abandon the subsidy for voice services.", "16058 MS. LAWRENCE: And if I could just add on to that, I think as well to speak to the 88 percent of rural Canadians that still have a land line, the uptime of your land line traditional telephone dwarfs any VoIP service as far as reliability and it's precisely those times, in times of power outages and emergencies, that customers need to be able to rely on that picking up their phone and getting someone on the other end. ", "16059 From our company\u2019s perspective why we -- our members\u2019 perspective, why we still feel that the high cost serving area is vitally -- subsidy is vitally important to our businesses, I think it was MTS mentioned that they were particularly at risk to losing the high cost serving area fund, because they serve double the amount of high cost serving area exchanges that any other provider in Canada did or their percentage was higher. ", "16060 And they were something like 20 percent of their total mass was in a high cost serving area. ", "16061 We have 100 percent of NAS are in high cost serving areas. For us an urban area is maybe 20 to 30 homes in some cases, maybe 4 or 5. ", "16062 We do not have any opportunity to cross-market subsidize between a community even close to the size of Kingston with our operations in a rural area. It\u2019s just not there in our serving areas.", "16063 So we feel that we are even more vulnerable than the likes of SaskTel, MTS, as far as needing to ensure that we have the high cost serving area funds available to ensure service to Canadians. ", "16064 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. ", "16065 I want to talk in -- I think it was actually -- I have to be careful because my writing is not very good and I get paragraphs and pages mixed up, but I think it was page 1 of your February response. ", "16066 You point out that access to broadband is not just a problem in Canada\u2019s north and certainly the record shows that to be the case, but someone from Nunavut might suggest that they\u2019re situation might be a priority because, unlike your serving area, they don\u2019t have roads. ", "16067 So should we not focus first on the north and then move into these other areas?", "16068 MS. LAWRENCE: We seem to be hitting all my questions that I\u2019m responsible for.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "16069 MS. LAWRENCE: We believe you should ---", "16070 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You\u2019re welcome.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "16071 MS. LAWRENCE: We believe that you should focus on any Canadian that does not have service. So in the far north the issue may be transport into that community. In the rural areas and the remote areas that we serve it may be, and it is, the last mile.", "16072 So yes without question we do not fully comprehend the difficulties of living in Canada\u2019s north. However, we don\u2019t think you can ignore any Canadian that does not have service. It\u2019s just the solution to their issues may be different. ", "16073 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right it\u2019s certainly not our intention to ignore anyone. It\u2019s just you usually have to start some place.", "16074 Now in terms of your map and the hexagons, the ISEC hexagons and that, that\u2019s a useful construct. ", "16075 And this is a map of your members\u2019 primary serving areas; right?", "16076 MR. HOLMES: Not necessarily. This was just kind of a representative sample of what the country would ---", "16077 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. I just wanted to make sure it was a representative sample, because it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s useful, but we would -- you wouldn\u2019t suggest that we take this sort of look and apply it so that it, you know, it took in an area that I\u2019ve heard of frequently that\u2019s not too dissimilar from yours? ", "16078 Let\u2019s say the south shore of Nova Scotia where access is of service is a bit of an issue. ", "16079 You take -- we would take this same sort of template apply it there, or west coast of B.C., something or wherever; right?", "16080 MR. HOLMES: That\u2019s correct. ", "16081 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And just work through that? And this is an example of how it applies in South Western Ontario?", "16082 MR. HOLMES: That\u2019s correct. ", "16083 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "16084 So shifting into the area of subsidies, the system as it exists now is -- and it has moved things along pretty nicely, is market forces combined with targeted government funding.", "16085 Your submissions indicate that you have a few issues with government funding, the way it\u2019s worked for you.", "16086 So I\u2019d like, if you could clarify and perhaps give some examples, because I\u2019m guessing \u2013- I don\u2019t think I have to guess. ", "16087 From your submissions it hasn\u2019t worked for you or for your -- the people you serve. ", "16088 MR. HOLMES: I\u2019ll ask Ian to contribute on that. ", "16089 MR. STEVENS: So we -- Execulink has and our members have received one-time funding and we\u2019ve watched one-time funding being provided to other operators in and around where we operate and -- you know, some few examples.", "16090 We know -- I know of a local municipality that\u2019s received two tranches of one-time funding from two different funding sources. ", "16091 The second tranche rebuilt an entire network that the first tranche built. It was just moving the bandwidth target up higher. ", "16092 The winning proponent of the funding built fixed wireless networks. We won one round and somebody else won the other and the end result was that even today the network that we built three or four years ago is basically end of life. It\u2019s not meeting the demands of consumers. The towers are at capacity. ", "16093 The one-time funding -- to win the one-time funding we -- there\u2019s a series of requirements to be met. We built out to it. We got the cheque, but some of the complaints we\u2019ve heard is we\u2019re supposed to cover 100 percent of the region, provide service to all. ", "16094 Well fixed wireless it just doesn\u2019t quite work that well and there\u2019s people in valleys and people in forested areas that can\u2019t get the service. ", "16095 So when they thought they were getting high speed and everybody was getting high speed it was everybody but them.", "16096 In another region -- I guess it\u2019s about an hour from where we are, we are aware of somebody else received a bunch of funding. They had a five year commitment to provide a service speed. They got the cheque, they built the network. ", "16097 Almost five years to the day after the network was signed off on they sent Dear John letters to all their customers saying we don\u2019t want to do this anymore, we\u2019re shutting it down.", "16098 I don\u2019t know what their business rationale was, but all of a sudden these customers who are in rural areas, who were highly dependent upon these networks, were scrambling to find a solution to the problem.", "16099 I guess what we talk about here or what we see is that the one time gets it built, but it gets it built to today\u2019s standard. ", "16100 It doesn\u2019t look at long term network evolution that will -- we see recurring subsidy funding as a way to drive that continued conversation that by the way next year you have to move the benchmark from 10/3 to 15, to 20, and every year it kind of moves along.", "16101 And by tying in that recurring revenue lever it gives the regulator, the administrative body of the fund, to keep pushing along network evolution. ", "16102 It also speaks to -- when choices are made to build networks if you\u2019re going to build a network to meet the bar today, but you know you\u2019re going to lose your recurring revenue funding, you\u2019re not going to make a choice that in three years you\u2019ll have to throw up your hands and say well we\u2019ll have to go for another funding source to rebuild this thing again.", "16103 So those are some of the challenges we\u2019ve seen with one-time networks -- one-time funding networks and really think that a long term recurring funding mechanism gives -- can drive some very different behaviour in how networks get built out.", "16104 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So if we were to establish a funding or subsidy regime or -- and/or we were to give advice to others doing it, would you be willing to undertake to give us some wording that you would suggest would be useful in terms of, you know, you\u2019re -- first of all you\u2019re talking about service subsidy funding rather than capital grants. I get that. ", "16105 But if capital funding is to continue and take place what sort of suggestions would you make that would improve the outcomes?", "16106 MR. HOLMES: We can undertake to do that. ", "16107 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "16108 ", " UNDERTAKING", "16109 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So you mentioned it today and pointed to the need for systems that have capacity for Telehealth and just to be the devil\u2019s advocate on that, just a couple of questions in terms -- first of all, can you give some details on the types of services we\u2019re talking about when we\u2019re talking about telehealth?", "16110 MR. PETRUK: It\u2019s basically two-way conversations between a patient with an in-home care worker and a specialist, a nurse practitioner, a doctor who is remotely located. It has -- it started off with just phone calls and simple pictures and video, and now has escalated to the point where you can hook up full monitoring systems to a person in-house without the need of a specialist showing up onsite to do the monitoring. They can track a patient\u2019s health, cares or concerns remotely with the aid of an onsite nurse, nurse practitioner or a care giver.", "16111 So in an instance like that when we\u2019re talking about 10/3, if you only have one meg of upload, you may not have the horsepower that you need in a circuit like that or a service like that to get all that information to the specialist in time. And when you're dealing with people in rural or remote areas of Canada who need access to a specialist, it makes it very, very difficult if they need to travel for three or four days depending on where they live to get to the nearest specialist.", "16112 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The other -- the other thought was we\u2019ve heard quite a bit about, you know, the cost benefits to the health care system of serving people in rural and remote areas of telehealth and the benefits the broadband can bring to it and -- I mean the -- not only the health benefits to people, but the cost benefits to the health care systems. And I noted yesterday sort of in context that Health Canada had provided funding for -- through SaskTel -- in partnership with Sask -- well, they provided the funding, SaskTel had done the work to service First Nations in Saskatchewan.", "16113 Has there been any indication in your area that has this as a good service for people\u2019s health, and has it -- has a -- an actual return on investment to the operators of the health care system that the provincial health care systems might consider investing as part of this build as Health Canada did for First Nations?", "16114 MS. LAWRENCE: I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen any such a direct link between the two, but I can speak to service in our area. There happens to be a group -- a group of like companies that are similar independents in the same area, and for the past probably 10 years we\u2019ve connected up the local hospitals through fibre connections and allowed them to have access to a regional centre of medical excellence through additional fibre connections. ", "16115 So through obtaining the services, they are in fact contributing to the expansion of the network, because we put fibre to a specific hospital, that gave us access into a community that we didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t previously justify. So by being consumers they're helping build out the network.", "16116 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And they were paying ---", "16117 MS. LAWRENCE: They were paying ---", "16118 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- they were financing the build ---", "16119 MS. LAWRENCE: --- through ---", "16120 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- as a customer rather than as a grantor in terms of that.", "16121 MS. LAWRENCE: Yes.", "16122 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So they were inspiring the build through ---", "16123 MS. LAWRENCE: Yes.", "16124 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- that.", "16125 MS. LAWRENCE: And then we were able to leverage that build to ---", "16126 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right, of course.", "16127 MS. LAWRENCE: Yeah.", "16128 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, okay, thanks. What do you think would be the most efficient approach to the three following issues: digital literacy, adoptability and service for low income people, very low income people?", "16129 MR. HOLMES: Can you just clarify in terms of -- is there a Commission role in that or who\u2019s best to promote that?", "16130 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, I mean it\u2019s not -- there are issues that have been brought before us.", "16131 ---", "16132 MR. HOLMES: Right.", "16133 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- with -- generally I ask that we solve it, we\u2019ve pushed back a little bit and saying -- for instance, in low income if we\u2019ve said, you know, if the provincial social service agencies don\u2019t recognize access to broadband as a basic need, but it is, I mean it doesn\u2019t really matter the reasons through oversight on purpose or neglect, it doesn\u2019t really matter, they have decided not to fund it for people receiving social service benefits. ", "16134 Isn't that their role to make that decision or is it our role? Digital literacy, is it something that the industry should be taking on? Is it something that, you know, should be happening in the education systems? Do you think it belongs with us? Adoptability initiatives as well.", "16135 MS. LAWRENCE: Just to start off ---", "16136 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You don\u2019t have to ---", "16137 MS. LAWRENCE: --- the conversation ---", "16138 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You don\u2019t have to answer those, you know.", "16139 MS. LAWRENCE: I have something I want to say.", "16140 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I have to ask them, you don\u2019t have to answer them.", "16141 MS. LAWRENCE: Just to roll off, start the discussion on that question, a very good question obviously because we\u2019re struggling over it, but I think the primary role for the Commission has to be access, because without access all of those other discussions are moot. This is not a chicken and an egg scenario where we have to worry about digital literacy or access first, the primary decision is access.", "16142 So I\u2019ll -- no, you didn\u2019t ask about access in your question, but I just wanted to preface the discussion with that and then I\u2019ll let Jonathan speak to the others.", "16143 MR. HOLMES: And I\u2019ll shoot it down to Rob at the end of the table.", "16144 MR. PETRUK: When it comes to digital literacy and literacy training I can speak from Gosfield\u2019s perspective. I have 70-year old customers who have some of the fastest connections that we allow, because two Christmases ago their grandkids got them iPads. So they wanted iPads that would allow them to facetime with their family in various parts of Canada. Our technicians when they go onsite to do an install with a customer fully explain exactly what they're getting into, and we give them the ability and the instructions on how to search for questions on their own.", "16145 Further, we also have a service that\u2019s almost like a geek squad, where you can have one of technicians come and visit you for an hour and spend time to talk with you about everything that you need to know on how to make things work inside your home.", "16146 MR. HOLMES: And I\u2019ll take this up to more of a national level. I think -- I think in terms of the Commission\u2019s role, while you may not have direct jurisdiction to do much specific common problem, I think you can bring a laser focus on identifying what these issues are. ", "16147 You know, you\u2019ve got a pretty big record from this proceeding, you're the -- you're the -- at the federal level you're the telecom expert in the country. So you can -- you can issue reports, apply some moral suasion to your federal cousins, that kind of thing. And just say, \u201cHere\u2019s the issues that -- as we see them\u201d, but we also acknowledge that there's a real mix of jurisdictional issues. Issues when they do go across the river, they become political and get mixed up with -- with other government priorities and into budgets, and there\u2019s limited budgets for thing, people are making choices all the time.", "16148 So I think -- and this gets I think perhaps to your digital strategy proposal as well. I think there's lots of roles for lots of people, but I think the Commission\u2019s role can really just focus everybody and say, \u201cWe have a problem here, here\u2019s what we see the primary issues are.\u201d ", "16149 We really think perhaps the Minister of Industry who -- actually, I went back and looked at who initiated the David Johnston Report, and it was the Minister of Industry who got things going. You could make recommendations to him that, you know, we need to get industry stakeholders around the table and look at the specific issues.", "16150 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. You could too, by the way.", "16151 MR. ALLARD: Thank you. Just to address digital literacy as well from the small provider perspective. Obviously we don\u2019t have the means and ways to do, you know, grandiose things, but you know, we do operate in very small towns, villages and so on and so forth. So we hire people, we train them, and so they become experts of the field in high tech telecom jobs. So they become in essence kind of a \u201ctrain the trainer approach\u201d. So they go out to see their families, their friends, and they tell them about, you know, broadband internet services and how to make it work. And so those people learn a bit and they in turn inform others, so we get it done that way.", "16152 We also have -- many of us around the table here have got community TV channels. That\u2019s another form of digital literacy as well, because it\u2019s all volunteer-based of course, and so a lot of folks in small towns get to learn about how -- what the broadcast industry is, how to operate a camera, how to operate the backroom and so on and so forth, control room. So that\u2019s part of digital literacy for us as well.", "16153 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I know you\u2019ve mentioned -- you mentioned or made reference to it a couple of times, but you seem very clear that subsidy access should not -- should be technologically exclusive and leave out the wireless, the wisps in terms of that.", "16154 And I understand -- I'm taking it from what you've expanded on today that it's because it's a limited technology in terms of that, but I can't help feel a little sorry for those guys. I mean, they've been out at the end of the last mile for several years now with they're putting up their own money and ingenuity and bringing basic services to a lot of people around -- at the end of the Lech (sp) Road, and beyond, in terms of that.", "16155 So how could we justify excluding them or recommending exclusion should there be a subsidy regime? Although I note that they're not necessarily in favour of one.", "16156 MR. HOLMES: Well, we've said that the subsidy regime should be technologically neutral. So if a wireless service or a wireless carrier can meet the BSO and provide that creative service to a particular NAS, then they would be eligible for a subsidy.", "16157 And I think perhaps what we haven't been as clear on as maybe we should have is that, you know, we acknowledge that even though wireline is the best, and delivers what it promises, that it's never going to be able to reach all Canadians. So at the far end, yeah, at the far end of wireline networks, scenarios where there'll never be wireline networks, we see a role for wireless service providers to participate there.", "16158 And if you -- you know, if you wanted to, as a result of this proceeding, look at some kind of subsidy mechanism to acknowledge that, I don't think we'd be opposed to it because there is just some places that wireline networks will never reach.", "16159 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, dispossess me of this. It sounded a little -- I got the impression reading it that your goal was to make sure they were non competitive within your serving areas. To be blunt about it. Dispossess me of that notion.", "16160 MR. STEVENS: That wasn't the objective. Execulink has, I think, just shy of 100 towers out there that we do wireless services on.", "16161 Our wireless -- fixed wireless network, it feels like every time you do an upgrade you've met today's need but tomorrow's -- the next day, the next week is not year out. The customer satisfaction still -- the customer demand consumes everything you upgrade.", "16162 We believe that fibre is the end game. We're not there. We watch cable operators push fibre deeper to nodes. The copper-based networks have remotes getting further and further out, all fed with fibre. Even the fixed wireless industry, everybody's trying to get fibre to their tower, same with mobility as well.", "16163 So we're pushing fibre and fibre deeper into the network. Having built that fibre networks, our experience is once you get it there all of the digital noise about service, quality, speed, it all goes away, and -- but it persists very highly in wireless networks. They just don't measure up.", "16164 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "16165 In regard to affordability, in the EKOS survey, it was noticeable that, for instance, residents in the Northwest Territories were, no matter how grudgingly, accepting of the fact that in the high cost service areas they might have to pay a little bit more for service.", "16166 In your areas, I think is my question, is the bigger, I mean, bigger issue price, or is it comparable service? Like would people in your areas ---", "16167 I mean, given, you know, the cost of housing and all kinds of things are much different in some of these areas than they are in Toronto, the different lifestyle things, in the grand scheme of things is an extra $10 or $15 a month on an Internet bill going to be a deal breaker when you have a 10 minute drive to work as opposed to a 2 hour commute into Toronto and that sort of thing, provided you have access to similar services? Or is price equality a firm thing for your customers?", "16168 MS. LAWRENCE: I think that -- I think someone mentioned the other day if you ask someone if they want to pay less for cauliflower they're going to say yes, and I think the same goes for Internet in our areas. But at the end of the day, I think the primary issue is having access to similar services. That's my perspective in our area.", "16169 As far as affordability for financially challenged people, I think that may be a different issue.", "16170 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Those are my questions. I'll refer to my colleagues if they have any.", "16171 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "16172 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you.", "16173 I heard what you said about fibre, and I think that that's -- I think there's no question every customer who gets fibre to their home is a lucky customer. But this hearing certainly has emphasized that there's a lot of customers that are far from fibre and their needs are not being met at all today.", "16174 I want to go back to where you were defining whether a basic service, if it is to be determined that Internet is a basic service, whether it's 5/1 or 10/3, you were talking about quality indicators along with that.", "16175 And one of my questions, my first question is, while we've had a lot of discussion about 5/1 or 10/3, services today are sold as up to versus floor speeds. So what do we do about that? As we're defining this service, are you suggesting it's a service up to 10/3? Is it a service that's available 80 percent of the time at 10/3? How do we define that element of speed?", "16176 MR. PETRUK: Well, as I mentioned earlier in our submission, availability should be 99.999 percent of the time.", "16177 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: At the speed ---", "16178 MR. PETRUK: At the speed the customer ---", "16179 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- that's advertised?", "16180 MR. PETRUK: Yes.", "16181 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Ninety-nine point nine-nine (99.99)?", "16182 MR. PETRUK: That's ---", "16183 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So you are requiring fibre to every home?", "16184 MR. PETRUK: I think on copper circuits you can provision them in such a way that they will work to the up to speeds or to the speed that a customer is requesting or paying for. That's a network design topology that I think would be different for each service provider.", "16185 But in terms of the monitoring of the circuits, if it was included in the obligation to serve, and if it was regulated, we could use the existing mechanisms that the CRTC already has in place for complaints from customers and monitoring to make sure that the customer is getting what they're paying for, that their speeds are what they're supposed to be, as advertised or as described by the service provider in question.", "16186 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, service providers advertise them as up to speeds, and that's my issue. Because clearly, we've -- we have a lot of different incidents brought before us to indicate that the up to isn't happening very often in some cases. We had a gentleman yesterday talking about receiving that speed 22 percent of the time, I think.", "16187 MR. PETRUK: In those instances, we are seeing that in parts of our operating territory with customers who are using a wireless service, and as soon as a wired service becomes available, they're more than happy to switch because there is a higher rate of reliability.", "16188 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, I understand that.", "16189 MR. PETRUK: Sorry.", "16190 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And if everybody could have fibre or even a DSL connection, great, but you folks know well the donut issue, and I think you've come before us essentially speaking about everybody outside of the donut hole; right?", "16191 I mean, those are the underserved, those are the challenged to serve, those are the ones that DSL is not touching at this point. They're outside of the range of DSL. Those folks are the ones who are being challenged by wireless and satellite solutions that are giving them service not of the same reliability.", "16192 So unless and until those folks, somehow you're extending your fibre to those folks, they are likely to be using shared networks, congestion issues, and so on.", "16193 And so give me some direction, perhaps something more reasonable than 99.9 percent as to how we would define the basic service related to the speed, reliability, and so on?", "16194 MS. LAWRENCE: I think -- I can't address the nine's issue, but what I would like to say with regard to the donut effect and the folks in the outlying areas, is when we are rolling out our networks and developing our future plans, it\u2019s -- the first step is not necessarily a direct fibre to the home connection. We\u2019re extending our remotes, our boxes further connected by fibre, shortening that loop line in a step to ultimately get to a direct fibre connection. So with technologies like VDSL, we are able to provision those 10/3 services at a high standard.", "16195 MR. HOLMES: I\u2019ll ask Ian to ---", "16196 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Outside of your community boundaries?", "16197 MS. LAWRENCE: Into the rural areas of our exchange services.", "16198 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You\u2019re taking VDSL outside of ---", "16199 MS. LAWRENCE: Yes.", "16200 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Oh.", "16201 MR. HOLMES: I\u2019ll ask Ian to contribute as well.", "16202 MR. STEVENS: So the 5/9s, we\u2019ve been able to do that telecom for a long time with voice. And with DSL, and even cable networks, we\u2019re seeing really high availability when you don\u2019t push it really, really hard, when you, as Angela said, take fibre deeper. It might not be right to the house, but it\u2019s maybe within the last mile. I think we can start to see service levels that are approaching those numbers.", "16203 MS. LAWRENCE: If I could just add one final comment because the questioning from you is interesting. But the questioning we get from our customers on a daily basis, why don\u2019t I have fibre, that helps drive our decisions to get the VDSL out further to them so they\u2019re not experiencing any different level of service, whether they have a fibre connection or a copper-based solution.", "16204 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. And I hope you continue to drive out your fibre as far as you can.", "16205 One of the -- I think you had the conversation with the Vice-Chair acknowledging there\u2019s going to be somebody at the end of your wire. And those folks are looking at different solutions. I mean, I\u2019m prepared to accept the availability and reliability on wired networks that you\u2019ve suggested here, I mean, for purposes of this conversation. But there are other networks that are also in play here in order to serve all Canadians. ", "16206 The underserved are using wireless. You yourself are using wireless. Those networks are more challenged with oversubscription, with congestion. And I was just looking to you folks to say what might be reasonable ways if this becomes part of the basic service, which means there\u2019s obligations, you know, around ensuring it\u2019s available and reliable, how would we define that in a way that\u2019s reasonable so that customers get a reasonable experience always? Not just, you know, at midnight.", "16207 MR. STEVENS: So back to the fixed wireless networks. We know that -- and I think -- we know that the minute a wired broadband shows up all our customers are off the fixed wireless network. They just -- they abandon it like rats from a ship.", "16208 We, in our networks, we see and we pushed out fibre to service small and smaller clusters of customers, sometimes under 20 or 30 per remote. And we don\u2019t see that investment in the adjacent wired networks. ", "16209 We see the investment, the dollar spent -- I think there\u2019s -- last year there was 15 -- almost $15 billion invested in telecom across Canada. We see a lot of that investment going into dense urban areas where there -- two operators are competing against one another to push speeds beyond 100 meg.", "16210 We know that we can push the wired networks harder, we can invest and get the remotes closer to the customer to give them the speeds they need. We\u2019re not seeing that happening in adjacent networks.", "16211 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Vennard?", "16212 MR. ALLARD: Just allow me to --", "16213 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "16214 MR. ALLARD: -- give you my own personal perspective. I\u2019m one of those who lives at the end of the road, if you want. I\u2019m two hours away from downtown Montreal. And I\u2019m close to retirement, so I\u2019m semi-retired so I\u2019m doing work at home. And I\u2019d actually need high speed bandwidth. ", "16215 Where I live, it\u2019s in a very, very remote area covered by mountains. And so cell towers, I\u2019m lucky if I get one bar of cell. So let\u2019s forget broadband on cellular. I\u2019ve called them all. I\u2019ve called Telus. I\u2019ve called Bell and Fido, everybody else. Nobody has -- nobody can give me that kind of service. Called the incumbent phone company. They don\u2019t have high speed Internet in that area. One day they might, but no plans, no firm plans.", "16216 So all I\u2019m left with is satellite-based technology or fixed wireless technology. One of which is fairly decent at the speed level, but is excessively high for over usage. And you know, doing teleworking and stuff, I can go over. And I had a child that came over who\u2019s a gamer. And all of a sudden I get this warning message from my supplier saying that current trend I\u2019m going to paying $429 in over usage this month. Like that\u2019s -- that was incredible.", "16217 And if I go with the other guy, well, there\u2019s Internet traffic management practices and so on and so forth. So neither one is really optimal for my particular application.", "16218 So I would bet that if there was a subsidy scheme, probably the incumbent would do something. He probably wouldn\u2019t bring fibre to my home because I\u2019m really remote. But maybe there would be, you know, a fibre cabinet, fibre to the node system somewhere. And just maybe I might be able to get some level of Internet service from the incumbent phone company.", "16219 Or, you know, as we said a while ago, it is conceivable that in some areas wireless or satellite technology is, in fact, the only viable solution. And so perhaps in those cases, it\u2019s not necessarily the same level of performance that must be mandated. But certainly something better than what is today, both in terms of pricing and in terms of quality of service.", "16220 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Vennard?", "16221 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: We\u2019ve been hearing some interesting things throughout the -- our hearing on the utilization of existing infrastructure. For example, last week we heard about the Cree Nation and how they use the infrastructure of the power. And were you listening to that? You might want to go back and review that. But they\u2019ve created an entire network utilizing existing infrastructure.", "16222 We heard from SaskTel yesterday that they had done a fibre swap. If you go back to the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, one of their partners is also a power company. So the power companies have got fibre all over the place. ", "16223 And I\u2019m wondering if that -- does that fit into your plans at all? Have you looked at any of that? I don\u2019t -- I have no idea if it\u2019s in your area -- any of your areas, but I\u2019m just suggesting that that might be something that you want to have a look at too.", "16224 Has -- have -- does that fit in with what any of you are doing or know about?", "16225 MR. STEVENS: I can\u2019t speak for all of our members, but I know that there\u2019s probably two or three of us at the table that I\u2019m aware of that have done swaps, trades, deals, joint builds with other carriers, other power utilities, other people that have networks in our region.", "16226 From our perspective, you talked about the far north, we got to get fibre to the community in the far north. When we look at the rural areas that we service, there\u2019s already fibre to some part of that town on somebody\u2019s network. It\u2019s the last two, three miles of build that has to happen or DSL infrastructure upgrades or, you know, more fixed wireless towers if there\u2019s spectrum and space. Like that\u2019s the gap that we\u2019re seeing in the areas. That\u2019s the business case gap.", "16227 And so we continue to explore those ideas and we are always welcome to new ones that are well matched. You know, when two people show up to make a deal, they both have to get something out of it.", "16228 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. It sounds like you\u2019re in kind of the same situation in that respect is the -- for example, the Cree Nation, which their next phase of their plan for their network is to take it right to the home and it sounds like it\u2019s the same sort of challenge that you -- a lot of you people are facing as well.", "16229 MR. STEVENS: And in our kind of thesis is many parts of rural Canada are already that way.", "16230 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16231 MR. STEVENS: But there\u2019s no business case, no rational business case to push it to the next step. And that\u2019s, you know, kind of Pierre\u2019s comment. If the incumbent that he had had a little bit of push, they would take and invest capital dollars to make it happen as opposed to take those dollars to compete with a big cable operator in their urban markets where the cost-to-serve per household is much lower from the capital perspective and an operating perspective.", "16232 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, but you might gain some efficiencies if you utilize existing infrastructure -- things that are there already -- and then you could maybe even reposition some of your financial inputs into going into the home instead of doing -- you know, duplicating potentially an infrastructure that\u2019s already there, and that might be useful.", "16233 Another thing I was wondering about too was if you could try and clarify for me how a subsidy would work. Like, when you -- you obviously are not that big on the idea of a targeted funding to build because what happens to it after that. How would you see a funding mechanism working that would solve that problem?", "16234 MS. LAWRENCE: So are you talking about the provision of the funds or how you would draw funds out of the pool?", "16235 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Well both, because they have to -- they have to both come out somehow but they have to go in the first place somehow.", "16236 MS. LAWRENCE: So as far as the funds into the pool, part of our proposal is that currently funds are paid to the CFA based on a subset of telecommunications revenue in the country, we\u2019re recommending that that be broadened to include all telecommunications. So that\u2019s how we would envision the funds going into the pool.", "16237 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So that would be a contribution from, say ---", "16238 MS. LAWRENCE: Internet ---", "16239 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- retail internet ---", "16240 MS. LAWRENCE: --- and mobility.", "16241 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- income. Okay.", "16242 MS. LAWRENCE: So then ---", "16243 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you have any idea how much that might be, some numbers around that? Have you thought about that at all?", "16244 MS. LAWRENCE: As far as a rate that they would pay?", "16245 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16246 MS. LAWRENCE: So currently I believe it\u2019s .56 would be paid into -- .56 percent of specified telecom revenues are paid into the CFA fund. We believe that rate would likely need to go to about two percent, so about three times the current rate.", "16247 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. And ---", "16248 MS. LAWRENCE: So as far as drawing funds out of the pool, we envision a very similar process to the current draw out process, so involving the Commission setting what it deems to be the affordable rate for its basic internet package. And when I say \u201caffordable\u201d I mean the average Canadian not -- you know, maybe there\u2019s a different level of affordability for certain sectors. ", "16249 So the average affordable rate less the Phase II costs to provision the basic internet package as determined by that process and the shortfall would be eligible for funding from the pool.", "16250 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So that would then be -- it would be like on an application or do you tie that in with the obligation to serve?", "16251 MS. LAWRENCE: It would be tied in with -- if a party was choosing -- was submitting to the Commission that they are willing to take on the obligation to -- or that they are applying for the funding they would take on the obligation to serve.", "16252 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you see operating companies being able to move from area to area or just in their own operating area?", "16253 MS. LAWRENCE: So we are looking at it based on the, I said, hexagon boundaries as opposed to the traditional telephone boundaries.", "16254 And as Pierre was saying earlier, we believe that yes, a provider, be it a telecom, cable, wireless, that meets those criteria would be eligible for -- eligible to draw funds from the pool.", "16255 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So, for example, within your own organization, if you had a corporation that was focused on filling in those gaps then that organization could conceivably go from area to area from Ontario to British Columbia or other areas as well and then access that and take on the obligation to serve that\u2019s not necessarily attached to a particular area ---", "16256 MS. LAWRENCE: Correct.", "16257 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- for a particular function? Is that ---", "16258 MS. LAWRENCE: Correct.", "16259 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Is that what you were thinking?", "16260 MS. LAWRENCE: Yes.", "16261 MR. HOLMES: Yeah, and the logic is we don\u2019t think there\u2019s any incumbency in broadband, so if one of our member companies sees some opportunities like 25 miles away outside of their SILEC territory they\u2019d be free to go and build a network there and then start claiming subsidy for the broadband NAS that they serve.", "16262 Pierre?", "16263 MR. ALLARD: Just a small comment. I looked at the map that you put online recently. It\u2019s a very good effort by the way. It appears to be based on the hexagon system so that\u2019s great. ", "16264 I guess my comment is that in order to make it even more productive, I think there should be a mechanism in there so that you can actually -- there\u2019s a tool that would allow you to essentially drill down to a specific hexagon. ", "16265 I was having some trouble, you know, focusing down to the specific individual hexagon. But once you\u2019re there, there should be a tool to be able to kind of challenge what\u2019s being shown in terms of coverage. ", "16266 Obviously LTE coverage, for example -- and it\u2019s right on the site too -- LTE coverage may not cover all areas, and that\u2019s really a fact, but there are many other wireless systems that claim that they\u2019re able to cover certain areas and they just can\u2019t for reasons of topography and others. ", "16267 So there should be a mechanism in there for different suppliers to say our customers are telling us that there is absolutely no supplier able to provide service there so therefore we should be able to go into the system interactively and update that hexagon to say there is no supplier.", "16268 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Okay, those are my questions. Thank you.", "16269 THE CHAIRPERSON: And we hear you on the map. It is a first cut at it and it needs to be improved.", "16270 As you know, we have some satellite-served communities in this country, and for the foreseeable future I think that\u2019s going to be the case. Do you think there should be a different broadband BSO for satellite- served communities?", "16271 MR. ALLARD: Yeah, what we\u2019re suggesting is that for the most part different suppliers that are getting a subsidy should meet the same level of BSO. However, there are -- yes, there are certain areas where it\u2019s just conceivable that there is only a single technology available to provide service to that particular customer. And so it is quite conceivable that there might be different levels of performance that might be attached to that BSO in those specific cases.", "16272 THE CHAIRPERSON: So what would be the BSO in those communities, in your view, in terms of speed and other characteristics? ", "16273 MR. HOLMES: We haven\u2019t really put a lot of thought into what a satellite BSO would look like. I\u2019m hesitant to say we could undertake to do that because we don\u2019t have a lot of experience in those areas.", "16274 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you might turn your mind to it in the subsequent phases on the 25th of May and the 13th of June for instance?", "16275 MR. HOLMES: Yes.", "16276 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Understood.", "16277 It wouldn\u2019t be a telecom hearing if I didn\u2019t get to ask a Phase II cost question. Ms. Lawrence, you mentioned that we would probably or might have to go through a Phase II cost approach if we were in a case where a supplier was providing both phone and broadband. How would the loop cost be assigned in that case?", "16278 MS. LAWRENCE: Let me first preface with the fact that I am not anywhere near a Phase II expert.", "16279 THE CHAIRPERSON: Oh, nor am I.", "16280 MS. LAWRENCE: But I think my initial response to that would be that the loop costs would be allocated based on -- currently right now based on traffic. I think that would be the basis that would drive the allocation of those costs.", "16281 THE CHAIRPERSON: So it would be shared on how much traffic was voice and broadband?", "16282 MS. LAWRENCE: Right.", "16283 THE CHAIRPERSON: At least conceptually?", "16284 MS. LAWRENCE: Yeah.", "16285 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. But we\u2019ll see in practicality how that would work.", "16286 Yes?", "16287 MR. HOLMES: I think Ian might have something.", "16288 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "16289 MR. STEVENS: I think, you know, the thought -- Angela\u2019s thought is right in line with what we\u2019ve been -- I\u2019ve been thinking about as well is that there needs to be some allocation. ", "16290 What it ends up doing is those that already have a network have a slight advantage in terms of Phase II costing potentially than somebody else that already is trying to come in with only half the story.", "16291 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "16292 I don\u2019t want to pick on you, Ms. Lawrence, but I noticed that you -- for Hay Communications you have unlimited offerings ---", "16293 MS. LAWRENCE: Yes, we do.", "16294 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- and -- including for fixed wireless? ", "16295 MS. LAWRENCE: Yes. Mind you, the ability to crank up a lot of volume on our fixed wireless is greatly diminished.", "16296 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So why did you go in that direction? Because, you know, some might argue that the reason we, in the earlier days, had caps was to manage the network and it\u2019s morphed into something other, arguably, and yet you\u2019ve chosen to go unlimited.", "16297 Is that because there is less of a need to manage the network through caps?", "16298 MS. LAWRENCE: So I don\u2019t think it was a conscious decision. When we first rolled out our internet packages it wasn\u2019t something that was considered. ", "16299 I\u2019m anxious to see the results of the query that was sent out recently by the Commission in terms of average use by package. To see how far our average use is different from those that do have internet caps, so I\u2019m looking forward to that.", "16300 We have considered it at various times. However, our build of our overall network has not been hampered, has not been a requirement to -- we haven\u2019t seen the immediate need to restrict our users. ", "16301 And it certainly is something that would generate a lot of customer backlash. Whether they were affected by it or not, customers want the ability to choose -- or to not be concerned about their usage so there\u2019s a marketing impact to it. ", "16302 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right but you probably still have fair-use policies?", "16303 MS. LAWRENCE: We do.", "16304 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. ", "16305 MS. LAWRENCE: We do.", "16306 THE CHAIRPERSON: For the extreme cases. ", "16307 MS. LAWRENCE: Yes, yes. ", "16308 THE CHAIRPERSON: Anyone else on this?", "16309 MR. STEVENS: So Execulink offers unlimited and capped packages and -- on both our own infrastructure and on resold TPIA and Bell wholesale networks. ", "16310 We spend a great deal of time engineering and watching our customers, on the TPIA and wholesale networks, and can attest that the consumers that are on unlimited consume a lot more than those that are on capped packages. ", "16311 It is an engineering factor that we spend quite a bit of time on. ", "16312 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. From an engineering perspective but ---", "16313 MR. STEVENS: Cost -- and cost.", "16314 THE CHAIRPERSON: And you can -- well obviously for cost, but economically as well; right?", "16315 MR. STEVENS: Yes.", "16316 THE CHAIRPERSON: So -- yes, okay. ", "16317 MR. STEVENS: Yes. ", "16318 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m glad you mentioned the interrogs we sent on usage. It\u2019s not just the FCC that\u2019s looking at this issue; we are as well.", "16319 Your position as an ILEC -- as ILECs, and granted smaller ones, where you\u2019re seeming to come forward and say we think you should have an obligatory standard, which is quite a stretch in terms of speed, seems to be out of whack with other ILECs.", "16320 And I was wondering -- and yet it will require investments will it not? ", "16321 And yet you\u2019re thinking that that\u2019s the right solution and I\u2019m struck that the smaller players are making that argument, whereas almost unanimously the larger players are on the other side of the issue.", "16322 Help me understand that.", "16323 MR. HOLMES: Help you understand why we\u2019ve ---", "16324 THE CHAIRPERSON: Why you\u2019re so -- as ILECs, smaller -- probably one could argue you have less capacity --", "16325 MR. HOLMES: Sure.", "16326 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- you\u2019re ready to step up, but the -- to a very stretched goal, but the larger companies, often some of them are publicly traded, obviously are concerned about financial issues, as they should be, are in a publicly traded market place and about their investments and all that, why they seem almost unanimously to be against this sort of standard.", "16327 MR. STEVENS: So in my opinion I think you\u2019ve nailed talking about how they are funded, managed, owned. The reason why they are -- they have to continue to meet quarterly results and the capital investments needed to do rural Canada with -- if it\u2019s not funded doesn\u2019t make business sense. ", "16328 So they are spending their dollars on markets where they have the lowest cost to get the most speed, the most value for their shareholders. ", "16329 Now in my view, you know, it\u2019s easy in downtown Ottawa to get to 10, 15, 20,000 customers. I was looking out the hotel this morning, there are more customers in the high rises I could see out my hotel window that we have in our entire service operating territory.", "16330 It\u2019s highly dense, very low cost. And they\u2019re competing, two incumbents -- or a cable and a -- generally a cable and a telco, are competing for the customer and if they don\u2019t keep investing in these markets the other guy is going to win. ", "16331 So they\u2019re taking their capital dollars, putting it where it\u2019s the best spot to get revenue and it\u2019s not in rural areas. When we look at -- we believe that the rational business decision is not to invest in non-dense areas. ", "16332 So they\u2019re doing exactly what they\u2019re stakeholders are asking them to do, get the most revenue, most profit ---", "16333 THE CHAIRPERSON: Stakeholders or shareholders?", "16334 MR. STEVENS: Shareholders.", "16335 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, sorry.", "16336 MR. STEVENS: Thank you. ", "16337 Are asking them to do and get the most dollars for their investment and rural Canada is not going to do that for them.", "16338 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. ", "16339 You may have heard that I\u2019ve -- thank you for that. That\u2019s useful and something that perhaps others should reflect on in the further stages, because there is quite a different perspective on it.", "16340 As you noted we asked other providers, and it\u2019s a bit more complicated in your case because you represent a lot of companies, about complaints that you might receive about internet services. ", "16341 And many have undertaken to provide some explanation or a description of the top three internet related -- broadband internet related complaints that you receive. ", "16342 Have you given some thought on how you could do that in light of the fact that you have several companies before us?", "16343 MR. HOLMES: What we usually do when we get Commission interrogs is I get them and then I distribute them out to everyone.", "16344 So if you\u2019d like us to do that --", "16345 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "16346 MR. HOLMES: -- I can definitely ask for just give us the top three --", "16347 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes.", "16348 MR. HOLMES: -- that you receive and we can undertake to file that. ", "16349 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, that\u2019s good. If you could, thank you.", "16350 ", " UNDERTAKING", "16351 THE CHAIRPERSON: And again complexity, because we\u2019ve been asking for \u2013- and I don\u2019t even know what your practices are from company to company in terms of contracts versus just using general terms and conditions. ", "16352 Do you have specific internet contracts or does it differ broadly? ", "16353 MS. LAWRENCE: It\u2019s probably a wide range of practices, as far as contracts or terms of service. ", "16354 THE CHAIRPERSON: Again, realising the complexity of having so many folks in front of us, could you undertake to give us let\u2019s say five, whether it\u2019s a contract or terms and conditions, by which you offer internet services?", "16355 In my view probably terms and conditions are a contract, but I don\u2019t have ---", "16356 MR. HOLMES: Yes, we can undertake to get five examples for you.", "16357 THE CHAIRPERSON: For five of your members? Representative --", "16358 MR. HOLMES: Representative, yes.", "16359 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- of them. So if there\u2019s two that are identical that\u2019s not useful. That won\u2019t be useful but, you know, just to get a range of those that would be useful --", "16360 MR. HOLMES: Yes.", "16361 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- as an undertaking for the 5th of May, granted.

", "PRESENTATION", "16367 MR. DUCHCHERER: Good morning Minister Chairman, minister -- or Mr. Vice-Chairman, ladies and gentlemen Commissioners and Commission staff.", "16368 I am Terry Duchcherer, past Chairman of the Board of Directors of CanWISP and Co-owner of Netago, a wireless ISP based in rural Alberta. ", "16369 I would like to introduce the team that will be presenting today. ", "16370 To my right, Christopher Pape, Vice-Chairman of the Board; and Meredith Simpson, co-owner of Kingston Online Services; to my left, Johnathan Black, CFO of Storm Internet; and Guy Lussier, consultant for CanWISP as well as to many of our members.", "16371 Unfortunately, the Chairman of our Board was not able to join us today and since this consultation was initiated under my mandate, he has asked me to carry on the project.", "16372 I\u2019ll let Meredith start off with a description of our industry and relevant issues.", "16373 MS. SIMPSON: We thank you very much for giving us the time to share our experience and our views of the needs of both private and business consumers living in rural and underserved markets in Canada.", "16374 CanWISP is an association of Canadian Wireless Internet Service Providers operating mostly in areas that are not serviced by large operators.", "16375 Our association is growing. We have 40 members after only 3 years of operation. Our members now serve over 130,000 subscribers spread across almost all the provinces.", "16376 The typical profile of our members is an owner-operator, a technical entrepreneur, who is passionate about the service they provide. They built their own network to the Internet and they build a company around their customers' needs. The large majority of our members live in the communities that they serve.", "16377 Many of our members started providing Internet service when Netscape was still the prime web navigator. We have a lot of experience with providing Internet service in underserved and hard to reach or scarcely populated areas.", "16378 Before we dig in this presentation, we want to acknowledge that on April the 18th, the Chairman provided new direction for this hearing. Although we already have some thoughts on the issues raised by the Chairman, we would respectfully ask for the opportunity to provide the Commission with a more detailed response at the May 5th deadline.", "16379 In this short presentation, we would like to address the following four main topics:", "16380 Number one: Market forces for the provision of Internet services in rural and hard to reach or scarcely populated areas across the country;", "16381 Number two: Operational subsidies for the delivery of Internet services in rural areas;", "16382 Number three: The need to establish a regulatory mechanism to provide infrastructure funding in order to foster better and more robust competition for the offering of Internet services to customers living in rural and hard to reach or scarcely populated areas. And finally;", "16383 Number four: The need to ensure a more efficient and effective way to use spectrum, especially in rural areas, a constructive collaboration between the telecom industry, the Commission and Innovation, Science and Economic Development, ISED Canada, with a public policy objective of ensuring that consumers living in rural areas may benefit from the same level and quality of Internet service as those of us living in Canadian urban centres. These services should also be available at a reasonable price.", "16384 I'll let Jonathan now discuss some of the market dynamics that impact our members.", "16385 MR. BLACK: Let's start from what Canadian consumers are saying. What follows are some comments taken from Canadians' responses to the EKOS Survey on rural Internet service commissioned by the CRTC for the benefit of this public hearing.", "16386 From all the good information about Internet services that we found, we retained a couple of points. The following information pertaining specifically to the rural market.", "16387 First, Internet is the most used service of all the telecommunications services. Just from this data, it's clear that the Internet is an essential and valuable service.", "16388 Secondly, 8 percent of the 11 million Internet subscribers are served by fixed wireless. That's 800,000 homes and businesses. Fixed wireless is, therefore, an important method of delivering an Internet service to consumers in rural areas, and for good reasons. It's not as expensive as laying out wirelines, and if it is engineered correctly, in the right environment, it can be as reliable as wireline-based services.", "16389 Thirdly, we found comments that there is higher dissatisfaction about Internet access and services in rural communities because of pricing and service level.", "16390 So let's analyze each of these points and see how they link to our four main topics.", "16391 First point: Internet is an essential service.", "16392 Where there is no Internet service, there really should be. Since there are areas that still don't have a reliable service, we believe that capital expenditure funding assistance is both necessary and required, and this funding should be made available on a yearly basis.", "16393 Funding should be available through competitive bidding, letting market forces be the driver. However, in the past, many times we have seen public funding go to larger companies, which in turn, in many cases, used that money to overbuild existing networks in rural areas.", "16394 Above all, we consider that operational subsidies to telecom companies should be abolished where there is already an alternative voice offering. Using a public policy mechanism, such as the National Contribution Fund in this way, only distorts the marketplace. There is no longer a need for this type of financial support in Canada in the 21st century.", "16395 Our members have been operating in these areas without any type of operating subsidies. We can do this because we keep our cost structures low. Yet, we provide local employment and expertise in the markets and areas in which we operate. In doing so, we greatly contribute to the economic activities and social fabric of the rural communities we serve.", "16396 Second point: We found fixed wireless is an important and necessary tool to provide quality Internet access and services at a reasonable cost to the customer in rural areas. The reason is simple; fibre optic networks are expensive to build. However, wireless networks cannot be implicated -- implemented without the use of a scarce public resource, namely spectrum.", "16397 Unfortunately, current ISED Canada spectrum allocation policies stipulate that spectrum blocks are auctioned off by geographic areas, or tiers. These tiers encompass urban centres and surrounding rural areas. This makes licenses prohibitively expensive for our members.", "16398 Third point: Customer dissatisfaction in rural areas. There were two main areas of complaint \u2013- service and price.", "16399 Price to the subscriber. Well, services that are available in rural areas come from three main technologies -- mobile smart hubs, satellite, and fixed wireless. The first two solutions are very expensive", "16400 Our members, who are fixed wireless providers, tend to offer competitive service levels at lower prices than the competitors in our market. Despite this, even our members cannot match the price and service levels found in urban centres.", "16401 Pricing is also affected by the cost of infrastructure. In some cases, government funding is necessary to build the infrastructure. Competitive pricing depends on the availability of appropriately priced wireless backhaul and fibre optic Points of Presence.", "16402 Spectrum is another type of infrastructure that also impacts pricing. Earlier in the hearing, the Milton councillors referred to the unavailability of spectrum and we will address this a little later this morning.", "16403 The EKOS Survey further revealed that customers are also dissatisfied about the speed they get and the download capacity they have per month. In our world, this also equates to spectrum.", "16404 So we think that spectrum is the elephant in the hearing room that needs to be addressed or at least explained. From our perspective, spectrum is a big part of the problem as well as a part of the solution.", "16405 I'll pass it over to Terry at this point.", "16406 MR. DUCHCHERER: Let's explain the world from our point of view. It's impossible to deploy fibre optics everywhere; it would be too costly. We know, some of us have looked into it.", "16407 The only terrestrial solution is wireless, yet the spectrum that is allocated to solve the coverage is very small. However, we think that spectrum in general is underutilized in rural areas. We also think that it's not priced to solve the problems.", "16408 On the slide that you have on the screen, this is our world. Fifty-eight (58) percent of the spectrum is licensed and difficult to obtain by WISPs because of its pricing and availability.", "16409 We operate in unlicensed spectrum, which represents 20 percent, sharing the use with Wi Fi, home phones, baby monitors, video surveillance systems, utility meters, and even the RCMP in some areas. The Dynamic Frequency Selection, DFS spectrum, has a lot of limitations, which render it unpractical for coverage beyond 5 kilometres.", "16410 A lot of our members are deploying or looking to deploy LTE equipment. This further limits our selection to the Lite Licensed spectrum, which is only 4 percent, and we have to share with all other providers. In other words, we share the spectrum with a lot of services and we do last mile and backhaul in these same bands.", "16411 Also, we need to explain that licensed spectrum is auctioned in tiers, as it was mentioned by Rogers last week, but a tier always includes an urban portion and a rural portion, so one has to purchase the urban to get the right to use the rural. Very often, pricing is prohibitive for that reason.", "16412 Up to now, we think that we have exploited this natural resource very efficiently, but we are running out of options and creative solutions. And like everyone, we are seeing data throughputs and capacity requirements increasing exponentially.", "16413 The licensed spectrum band dedicated to fixed wireless is 3500 megahertz. It is the best-suited band because equipment is available.", "16414 Because of the transaction that took place last week between Telus and Xplornet, the band is now owned at 84 percent by Inukshuk, a Bell/Rogers partnership, and Xplornet. This is now a duopoly, since there is no spectrum cap for fixed wireless. It is not fostering healthy competition.", "16415 The duopoly becomes a monopoly in Toronto, where all seven blocks of spectrum are held by a single licensee, Inukshuk. Incidentally, Inukshuk covered rural communities but both Bell and Rogers stopped their wireless data operations in this band in 2012.", "16416 We would like to mention that there is unused spectrum in the rural areas assigned to mobile operators. Mobile spectrum needs are forecasted for dense urban areas and mobile operators acquire licences for all the territory, yet don\u2019t deploy much in the rural areas because of the density is low.", "16417 We also have a keen interest in the upcoming 600 megahertz auction rules and obligations because it may affect the remote rural broadband system, or RBS, and TV white space, both which show promise as a solution for our members.", "16418 We believe that is a public policy principle in order to foster robust competition to the benefit of rural Canadian consumers. Fixed wireless operators should have a reasonable possibility to access as much needed spectrum covering rural areas.", "16419 We are well aware that the CRTC does not have jurisdiction over spectrum management. This falls under ISED Canada. However, throughout this hearing we\u2019ve heard the Commission ask, what can the CRTC or other governmental organizations do to improve the situation?", "16420 CanWISP has the following recommendations.", "16421 We believe that there should be a National Broadband Strategy and that both the CRTC and ISED Canada have a critical role to play. We also believe that as part of this National Broadband Strategy, Canada\u2019s most valuable, invisible, natural resource, spectrum, is utilized in an effective and efficient manner in the delivery of broadband services.", "16422 Secondly, and possibly the most out of the box thinking, a broadband fund could be established. This will be funded by a small percentage of revenues of major carriers. However, given that major carriers have spectrum holdings which are idle in rural areas, then they should be mandated to contribute the spectrum to the fund in partial satisfaction of their required monetary contributions. ", "16423 Because of the recent changes in the environment since our original submission was filed, we feel that the need to value spectrum based on the megahertz per population rather than megahertz per hexagon in this scenario. In this scenario, a minimum amount of spectrum would need to be contributed to the -- turned off.", "16424 Operators wanting to use the spectrum would have to pay the fund to get access to it. Spectrum put into the fund will be made available for a sub-licensed term of at least five years. Yearly applications will be made by operators to fund capital expenditures necessary to expand or upgrade infrastructure in underserved areas in a competitive bidding process.", "16425 Adoption by the Commission of this proposal would provide a rapid yet bold and sound solution to a large problem that cripples Internet services in sparsely populated areas, both for independent ISP operators and the Canadian consumers living in those underserved areas.", "16426 In conclusion, our member\u2019s goal is to better serve the areas that we are in, expand where the demand is and will be in the future. We are incentivized by having the local politicians calling us and underserved residents meeting with us. But continue to work -- but continue our work in providing robust competition in Internet access in rural areas, we need the recommendations implemented.", "16427 Thank you very much for your attention and patience. We are now at your disposal to answer any questions you may have.", "16428 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Commissioner MacDonald will start us off.", "16429 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Good morning. And thank you for your comments this morning. They take a little bit of a different focus than the original submission. So I\u2019m going to -- I\u2019ll have a few questions on your original submission, but I\u2019ll largely base my questions on what you\u2019ve presented today.", "16430 Just to start out you note that your organization is only three years old and you\u2019ve got about 40 member companies. How did you all come together into one organization and what\u2019s your mandate, your mission statement?", "16431 MR. DUCHCHERER: Our group was founded primarily three years ago because there was a consultation on 35 megahertz spectrum and the renewing of licences at that time. So there was a group of about 12 operators that had a common interest in that. We met in Ottawa, formed the organization, entered a submission and on that proceeding, and then have grown from there to try to determine what are the other issues of our operators across Canada.", "16432 I cannot cite our mandate and mission off the top of my head, but I would be happy to put that into our submission May 5th as an undertaking.", "16433 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Okay. Thank you.", "16434 ", "UNDERTAKING", "16435 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: And your member organizations, because I looked on your website and I couldn\u2019t find it, are they -- tend to be clustered in one geography? Or do you have member organizations from across the country?", "16436 MR. DUCHCHERER: Our member organizations are just about in every province in Canada. Now we have representation in the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and B.C.", "16437 What was the second part of that question, please?", "16438 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: I was just sort of trying to get a sense as to where your organizations were, whether they were all, you know, clustered in the area around Toronto, for example, or whether they were representative of issues coast to coast.", "16439 MR. DUCHCHERER: I think it would be coast to coast. I know we have five members, I believe, in Alberta, three or four in Manitoba. So we do have representation. B.C. is a little bit lighter because they have the BCBA in that province. But we work with them as well. They\u2019ve been to our conferences. We\u2019ve been to theirs. And we keep in constant communication with them as well. The BCBA is actually a member of our organization as well.", "16440 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Okay. And of the 130,000 subscribers that you have across those member companies, do they tend to be the remotest of the remote or do they tend to be clustered in and around suburban areas or rural parts of the country that are still relatively close to larger centers?", "16441 MR. DUCHCHERER: Okay. So first let me clarify our position on rural and remote. We consider rural most of Canada but remote to be more the north. At this particular time, we don\u2019t have members in the north so we don\u2019t consider that part of our organization.", "16442 We have varying size members. So we have members that would have as low as 100 or 200 customers, and members that are larger into say the 27,000 mark. ", "16443 We have large members that are close to urban centres and we have large members that are completely rural. So it\u2019s a diverse mix of those type of companies.", "16444 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Okay. In your original submission you suggested a new target of 10 down and 2 up. And I\u2019m just wondering, was that agreed to by all of your members? And the follow-up question would be, to your knowledge, are your current members able to provide the minimum -- the current minimum of 5 down 1 up today?", "16445 MR. DUCHCHERER: So our original submission our target was agreed to at 5/1.", "16446 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Okay.", "16447 MR. DUCHCHERER: With a future target of 10 in 5 to 7 years.", "16448 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Okay.", "16449 MR. DUCHCHERER: The majority of our members today do provide a 5 by 1 service or are striving to get there. And we feel that market forces will push us towards a 10 service over the next few years.", "16450 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: And was the general thought that the current target and the future target in five to seven years that that would be adequate to meet both the needs of residential customers as well as small, medium business customers as well?", "16451 MR. DUCHCHERER: So I think we need to keep in mind that we\u2019re talking minimum targets, not maximum. And the majority of our members build to provide at least the minimum. But of course, being business people we need more revenue. More revenue is attracted by larger packages. So most of us do offer higher speeds.", "16452 So if consumers want them or if businesses want them, they are available.", "16453 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Okay. Perfect.", "16454 You\u2019d suggested ultimately moving towards a two meg up service. And yesterday we heard from SaskTel and they were suggesting that one meg up would be adequate even on a go-forward basis. So I\u2019m wondering, can you explain your thoughts as to why we may want to look at a target upload speed of two megs versus the one?", "16455 MR. DUCHCHERER: I believe we are seeing a shift of some services moving towards Cloud. So upload is being -- become a little more of a factor than it is today. The majority of traffic is still going to be in the download direction. But we don\u2019t want to choke our download direction by not having enough upload to support the services that we\u2019re using.", "16456 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: And do you see those future targets as being a regulated target, hard target or more of an aspirational target? Because we -- five years ago we set an aspirational target, and to large extent across the country, that has been met.", "16457 MR. DUCHCHERER: I don\u2019t think any of us have a crystal ball of what we\u2019re going to need in three to five years. The numbers we\u2019re saying today could be totally ludicrous or more than enough. I believe we have to remain aspirational, and I believe that as business people our consumers will continue to tell us what they want, how fast, how much capacity. And if we are to remain in business, we\u2019re going to have to meet that demand.", "16458 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I wish we did have that crystal ball, because I think it would make all of our jobs a lot easier.", "---(LAUGHTER)", "16459 MR. DUCHCHERER: Absolutely.", "16460 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yesterday SaskTel also told us that although they offer the 5/1 service, many of their customers elect to purchase a smaller package with -- with less bandwidth, be it for economic reasons or they just don\u2019t have the need for that type of capacity. Is that something that -- that your members see, people for whatever reason opting for smaller packages when they're provided?", "16461 MR. DUCHCHERER: I\u2019ll speak from my company\u2019s perspective. We\u2019ve offered a 5/1 for a few years now, we are now rolling out LTE into the majority of our area. We\u2019re not seeing the uptake that we expected to see from consumers. We\u2019re actually finding that a lot of them are happy with the 5/1 service. The consumers moving to higher packages are mainly families with lots of kids, maybe a little larger rural operations as far as business, but it has not been to the level we expected. So yes, I do believe that the consumer will always want a lower-priced option.", "16462 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And do you think the major driver there is just the price of the service, people making that decision for economic reasons or because that\u2019s actually what they require to contribute and be part of today\u2019s digital economy?", "16463 MR. DUCHCHERER: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always an economic reason. I believe there are people out there that are satisfied. And possibly in a rural population, we may find that the population is a little older than in the urban centres. A lot of the younger people move away from rural areas. So some of our older consumers have a need to check the weather, email, maybe Skype with their grandkids. They're starting to get into Netflix, but their needs are probably not as high as a younger generation.", "16464 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah. How do you position your -- well, just to back up, I mean we\u2019ve heard from -- from different satellite providers and companies like Xplornet that talk about their -- their future offerings and you know, the new -- new speeds that are coming. And I'm wondering how do you position your services against those of Xplornet or -- or other -- or other providers?", "16465 MR. DUCHCHERER: Yeah, as far as satellite services I believe we certainly have better performance metrics, better latency, better throughputs. I believe we\u2019re better positioned on price than a satellite service. Again, we\u2019re business people, you always have to monitor your competition and adapt to the marketplace in order to retain customers.", "16466 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So then ---", "16467 MR. DUCHCHERER: A second point that I think we do excel on is in customer support. A lot of our companies are local, we have offices where customers can come in and talk to us. We have people that live in their communities they're talking to on the phone. It\u2019s a different interaction with our customers than the larger providers.", "16468 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And that's because you're actually closer to the community, not -- and don\u2019t have to put someone on a plane or an excessively long truck roll to address a problem when it\u2019s -- when it actually arises?", "16469 MR. DUCHCHERER: That\u2019s correct, all of my company lives in the area we serve.", "16470 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So in a sense you're obviously in a different industry, you would be of the view that even services such as -- such as Xplornet or we had OneWeb speaking yesterday that that\u2019s -- those solutions aren\u2019t necessarily the silver bullet to solve all of the connectivity problems that we face in the country?", "16471 MR. DUCHCHERER: There's no one solution, it\u2019s not fibre, it\u2019s not wireless, it\u2019s not satellite, it's not low orbit. There is no single solution. The fact that we have multiple solutions is evident because of that need. And to the consumer, it gives him multiple choices.", "16472 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So if there's no one solution, should there just be one target across the country, or should we be looking at different targets whether they\u2019d be fixed targets or aspirational targets, should we be adapting that to account for the different realities across the country?", "16473 MR. DUCHCHERER: I would say that, you know, whoever would be involved in your national broadband strategy, that would be one question that they would have to answer inside that.", "16474 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just to move off of speed for a second, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about data usage and data caps and people that if the caps is set too low that they burn through it in the first few days of the month, then face significant overage charges. Does your company or any of your members offer unlimited packages today?", "16475 MR. DUCHCHERER: I\u2019ll let Christopher answer that one.", "16476 MR. PAPE: Thank you for your question. ", "16477 Several of our members do offer unlimited plans, either on the fixed wireless side or with other methods of delivery currently. I think that that is a strategy to reduce turn and to promote customer loyalty. We see a lot of turn in the business where customers feel that they might be charged or receive surcharges at every turn. And the customer likes to have a level of price certainty in their monthly expenditure for internet services. ", "16478 The challenge is that there are several types of users of internet systems, some are -- as Terry has previously mentioned -- looking to do some email, some web surfing, maybe some Skyping. Then there's another class that are very dependent on Cloud services like Netflix and other streaming media sites. And then finally there are heavy use customers who see the delivery of internet service as a constant service that they want to be able to fully utilize.", "16479 And so the challenge is to figure out a strategy where you could offer price certainty as well as not overwhelm your network configuration. So each member tends to look at unlimited service slightly differently, but many of our members do promote and supply it, and many of our members also use caps.", "16480 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: What ---", "16481 MR. DUCHCHERER: Can I just add to that?", "16482 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yes.", "16483 MR. DUCHCHERER: I'm going to add from the perspective of my own company. We started out doing unlimited internet mainly for the reason that we didn\u2019t think data was going to be a problem on our network. We since had to move to data caps, more to get consumers into the correct package than to penalize them with overages. We very seldom charge overages, but educate our customers as to where they need to be in our plans. ", "16484 I use the example of one customer I had that was basically downloading 24 hours a day, didn\u2019t care about the speed, he was just archiving data. He used between 800 gigabytes and a terabyte of data per month on a five meg package. That causes a problem for my other customers in that tier. Therefore, we had to implement a strategy.", "16485 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And what challenges from a technical standpoint does that create in your -- on your infrastructure -- your backend infrastructure, when customers are using data to -- to that level?", "16486 MR. DUCHCHERER: So wireless technology is based on bits of time. Each customer gets a bit of time to provide data, and if he\u2019s using all the time slots all the time, there aren\u2019t enough to go around for all the customers. So it has an impact on the ability to deliver services to other people.", "16487 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And it\u2019s a question for your company or your other member companies, for those that do provide unlimited packages, were you ever able to do any -- any monitoring or modeling to figure out what the average customer actually uses from a data perspective, knowing that there are different buckets of customers, the light users, the medium or heavy users? Do you have any data to suggest what -- what a minimum data allowance should be if we were to mandate one?", "16488 MR. DUCHCHERER: We don\u2019t have that figure on an industry-wide or organization-wide basis. In particular again, we just implemented a very good monitoring solution into our network so we\u2019re only about eight months of looking at data very closely.", "16489 We could get back to you on figures.", "16490 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "16491 M. DUCHCHERER: Poll our members on that.", "16492 ", " UNDERTAKING", "16493 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. That would be helpful.", "16494 And I know it\u2019s difficult because you\u2019re here speaking for 40 companies with 40 different backend systems and processes so I know that creates some complexity.", "16495 But how commonplace or do any of your organizations do anything today with respect to alerting customers when they\u2019re nearing their cap and what are the best practices to, you know, manage that relationship with your customers?", "16496 MR. DUCHCHERER: Okay. Again I\u2019ll speak from my perspective. ", "16497 We send out an email at 80 percent of data usage. In the email we explain to them that they\u2019ve reached this percentage. We also explain all the packages that we offer and the amount of data in each package. So we\u2019re hoping that at what point in a month they receive that email they should be able to determine how much they\u2019re going to use in a month. We send out a second email at 100 percent. So again they know now that they\u2019ve reached their caps. ", "16498 We do not throttle or stop bandwidth at any point. So we give two warnings and it\u2019s up to them now to monitor their usage or change packages.", "16499 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. In your third point this morning you mentioned that two of the main complaints that you receive is with respect to the quality of the service and the price. And since you are predominantly serving more rural customers, or at least customers outside the urban area, do you get the sense that rural customers expect to pay more for their service than urban customers would given the cost to deploy some of this infrastructure?", "16500 MR. BLACK: I\u2019ll take that. Thank you for the question.", "16501 Just to clarify, that comment came from the survey not necessarily from our membership, but as we read through the survey that was one of the comments that came out about rural internet. Of course, our customers aren\u2019t complaining. No, I\u2019m kidding.", "16502 From what we\u2019ve experienced, rural customers understand that they will need to pay a bit more than urban customers. They\u2019re not happy with it. Would they always want to pay less? Yes, of course. ", "16503 But I think in our membership our desire is to offer a competitively priced package at a minimal premium over what they would have to spend if they were living in an urban centre.", "16504 But, just to clarify, those comments were from the survey not necessarily from our members.", "16505 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. And again, just in your own conversations with rural customers -- I think everyone always wants to pay less for everything; we\u2019ve talked about the price of almonds and cauliflower so far in the hearing.", "16506 If people have concerns about price, do you get the sense that it\u2019s -- they just think everything should cost less, or they\u2019re doing a comparison to what their cousin or their brother might be receiving in an urban area, or is it more of a value for dollar, I don\u2019t feel that this $50 a month package is providing the service that I should get for $50 a month?", "16507 MR. BLACK: When we get comments about pricing it comes mostly because they\u2019re looking at a provider in an urban centre, service that\u2019s available in an urban centre, be it DSL or cable-based internet services, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re looking at a rurally based competitor.", "16508 So we do get the sense that they are comparing themselves to the urban centres, their uncle, their cousin, their relative.", "16509 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So that\u2019s price. The second is quality of service. And from within your own members and their relationships with their customers, what percentage of the complaints would relate to quality of service issues like jitter latency, mean time to repair when there\u2019s an outage?", "16510 And if you don\u2019t have that today that may be something you want to canvas your members and ask the question.", "16511 MR. DUCHCHERER: Yeah, I think that, as the previous group said, we could certainly query our members on what the top three or four service complaints are that they deal with and try to get back to you on that on May 5th.", "16512 ", "UNDERTAKING", "16513 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. That would be perfect. Thank you.", "16514 With respect to backhaul infrastructure, be it wireless, be it fibre-optic, what have you, do you have difficulty in obtaining -- I\u2019ll back up one step. Do you have difficulty finding out and discovering what your backhaul options are in a particular geography?", "16515 MR. LUSSIER: Yeah, thank you. So I\u2019m a consultant for many operators and usually the operators know very well the area in which they are in. They might not know the exact point of location of the point of presence but the operators or the suppliers -- the backhaul suppliers are certainly known.", "16516 If fibre goes around you just take a walk and look up the post and there\u2019s a tag and there\u2019s -- it\u2019s there, you can figure out where the fibre\u2019s going.", "16517 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: It might become a little bit more difficult if it wasn\u2019t on a pole but in a conduit, but I take your point.", "16518 MR. LUSSIER: But you can always go on Google Earth if you want and look up on Google Earth and you can see the tag.", "16519 MR. DUCHCHERER: I found your comment, or one of the comments from one of the Commissioners this morning about, you know, alternate accesses that we haven\u2019t thought about, for instance, power companies with fibre along their main transmission lines, could that be part of a strategy as well where a lot of those things are identified as alternate thoughts of where to be able to obtain fibre, because I believe you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a lot of fibre in the ground that is un-thought of that companies would even have it.", "16520 A friend of mine works for the power company and I asked him one day what the building was at the bottom of a transmission tower in the middle of nowhere only to find out that that was a fibre regeneration pop.", "16521 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So do you think it would provide value to your members if there was more access to that type of information? ", "16522 Because, to your point, it\u2019s not just the telcos that have fibre, municipalities are out running fibre, power companies are out running fibre. But it\u2019s difficult to sometimes discover what the best options are, and that has an impact on price, if you think there\u2019s only one fibre running into a community when in fact there may be a couple it limits your options.", "16523 MR. DUCHCHERER: I would agree with that. Again, we tend to think of looking for fibre from telecom companies. We haven\u2019t necessarily thought what are other sources of fibre out there.", "16524 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: In your dealings with the telcos, do you feel that they are eager to make those assets available to you at a reasonable price?", "16525 MR. BLACK: My company participated in the eastern Ontario regional network build-out, and as part of that I think they very wisely put in as a first phase the backhaul. So a number of fibre pops throughout eastern Ontario were installed by Bell and there were regulated or promised prices at which anyone could access those fibre pops.", "16526 In that situation, we were able to economically get access to that fibre and to internet transit. It also impacted the design of our network.", "16527 I wouldn\u2019t say they are reluctant. In fact, in many cases they\u2019re looking for customers for those remote areas, you know, and underserved. If they\u2019ve put in a fibre pop in rural Ontario they\u2019d like to get some revenue out of that too. ", "16528 So I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re reluctant. When we call them and say, you know, do you have anything in this area we tend to get a response. ", "16529 I think to your former question, we may not know what we don\u2019t know. You know, there may be fibre there in places -- or with companies. We\u2019re not asking. ", "16530 So I don\u2019t sense a reluctance.", "16531 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just one final question and then I\u2019m going to move to -- oh, sorry. Go ahead.", "16532 MR. LUSSIER: I\u2019m sorry. I wanted to talk a little bit about that.", "16533 I think your question also had a pricing side to it. I would say that on that side if you\u2019re in remote areas the price is very much higher, and I would say that sometimes it can go as far as three times the price that you get in -- you could get in the city. So that\u2019s the first portion. ", "16534 Then let me share a little bit about on the map the fibre accessibility or availability. I have worked with the Government of Quebec in some -- in trying to map all the network facilities that were available and in their big mapping plan that they started, they never finished it because of the change of the government. But they had all the fibre links mapped out from the telecoms and all the utilities and also the fibre owned by the government.", "16535 So that was very interesting but it stopped there and I think Quebec doesn\u2019t have the chance that these guys have in Ontario where you have a backhaul network to support WISPs like us.", "16536 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So that could send to an interesting area at least for me with respect to the mapping because there are two schools of thought.", "16537 One, yes, I want everyone to know where my fibre is because how can they buy it if they don\u2019t know it's not there. From an operation standpoint, it -- and that's the former sales guy talking.", "16538 From an operation standpoint, it may be, no, I don\u2019t want anyone to know where my fibre is running because then someone may cut the fibre and may choose to cut it going under a bridge or something like that where it's difficult to find and difficult to fix.", "16539 So how do you balance those two conflicting objectives?", "16540 MR. LUSSIER: I haven\u2019t seen any good answer on that point. The project in Quebec didn't go on but it was certainly a concern that they had from all the fibre providers or owners. So I don\u2019t have a good answer.", "16541 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. And just one final before I move on to spectrum because that was one of your key focuses.", "16542 We heard from Axia out in Alberta I think last week and they were proposing or they were suggesting that, you know, if we build the transport infrastructure, if we build those points of presence or points of interconnect in all of the different communities that market forces will prevail and there will be smaller providers that are interested in coming in and building out those local networks in community, be they wireless, be they fibre, whatever.", "16543 Do you think that's true in all areas of the country or will providers cherry pick the larger communities and then leave the smaller communities of 100 people continue to be stranded?", "16544 MR. DUCHCHERER: That's a very interesting question. Coming from Alberta and the Alberta SuperNet being built by Axia, we have seen fairly good penetration across the province. That was fairly evident in the last \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d program where there wasn't a lot of funding available south of Edmonton per se. There was a need still in the northern parts.", "16545 Cherry picking is always a concern. It's a concern for us as small businesses because, you know, we tend to go in and try to build everywhere, but if our competition is only coming in and cherry picking the larger portions of our network, it puts a lot of constraints on us to be able to continue to operate and provide the services to everyone. It also puts a lot of constraints on trying to build into those smaller niche areas.", "16546 So, yes, I think market forces will always dictate where there's a business case is where they're going to go and, you know, if we looked at a mapping exercise across the Canada after this was all done, those smaller areas that were missed could be, you know, capital funding provided on a reverse auction basis or something to have people go in and fulfil that area.", "16547 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And would you agree to the extent that there is any funding made available to go in that particular route that it should be targeted towards where there is no adequate service today as opposed to a blanket rebuilding of everything that already exists out there?", "16548 MR. DUCHCHERER: I would agree with that.", "16549 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay.", "16550 So with respect to the slides that you put up, you noted that Inukshuk, the partnership between Rogers and Bell, takes up about 53 percent of the available spectrum. To your knowledge, is that being used for anything?", "16551 Because if I rely on a number of years, I took part in an Inukshuk test program. I was one of the guinea pigs but I'm not aware whether that spectrum is actually being used for anything today.", "16552 MR. DUCHCHERER: At this point in time, we have to rely on ISED and their policies around that spectrum. They have an implemented policy where a certain percentage of the spectrum has to be used in each tier 4 area and they are satisfied that it is used to their conditions. So we have to abide by that, accept that. We have no proof one way or the other.", "16553 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. When the Rogers\u2019 panel presented, one of the statements that was made was that when they had unused spectrum that they weren\u2019t using to support one of their products or that they weren\u2019t planning on using to support a future service offering, that they would do sublicensing of the spectrum to other providers.", "16554 And I'm just wondering do you have any experience with Rogers or with other spectrum holders in setting up any sublicensing agreements?", "16555 MR. DUCHCHERER: I do know that one of our members, at least one of our members has a sublicense agreement with the Inukshuk group. Personally, I had a sublicense years ago with SaskTel when they owned a piece of spectrum. That piece of spectrum has been sold four times since the original agreement.", "16556 The process on a sublicense is that it does not automatically renew like a primary licence does. So in my particular case today, I don\u2019t have a signed use of the spectrum even though they're allowing me to still use it. ", "16557 I know other members have said they've tried to contact Inukshuk without success. It may be they're talking to the wrong people or it may be a reluctance for them to share it, or they may have said we have a plan for it. I don\u2019t know the exact answer to that.", "16558 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. And when you say it doesn\u2019t -- in sublicense agreement, it doesn\u2019t auto renew, you mean it doesn\u2019t auto renew at the end of the term or the contract isn\u2019t honoured when that spectrum is sold or traded to another company?", "16559 MR. DUCHCHERER: The sublicense is honoured on a trade but it's not automatically renewed on the license renewal period. So, for example, the 3,500 megahertz licences all expired in 2014 and were renewed on a one-year contract. Subordinate licences do not automatically renew like primary licences. They have to be reapplied for to Industry Canada every time the primary expires.", "16560 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: In your original proposal you made, there was a notation that I made that one of your recommendations was for providers to offer up in kind spectrum and I'm wondering can you explain that to me a little bit what you mean by in kind spectrum?", "16561 MR. DUCHCHERER: If it wasn\u2019t clear in our original submission, it was the same proposal we have now where they would be able to provide spectrum at a monetary value into a fund. We're not asking them to give the spectrum up for nothing.", "16562 So same type of thing as today we're saying if there is a percentage of their revenue that has to go into a broadband fund and they have spectrum, they can use that spectrum as a part of the monetary value that they would put in.", "16563 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So if a company\u2019s obligation was to put a million dollars a year into some type of fund, if they put in a million dollars\u2019 worth of spectrum, that would satisfy their obligation?", "16564 MR. DUCHCHERER: Correct.", "16565 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Are there other methods available to make that spectrum available for your purposes or other methods that you could suggest to entice the service providers to either do sublicensing or open it up for your use after they've made the initial purchase?", "16566 MR. DUCHCHERER: So any policy on spectrum obviously would have to come from ISED. ", "16567 But to your question, I think of mandatory tower sharing that came in a few years ago. As soon as we were a license holder in Canada, now a spectrum, any tower, infrastructure that we have we're mandated to have to share that with other providers. ", "16568 Possibly, there's a policy the same way around spectrum. If you have a spectrum, and it's unused, perhaps there's a policy that says you have to share it. ", "16569 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Do you have any thoughts on why owners of the spectrum, if they're not using it or don't plan to use it in the immediate future, say the next 5 to 10 years, why they're not more eager to proactively go out and establish those sublicensing agreements? I would think if they've paid a significant amount of money for an asset, that they'd want to monetize it to the greatest extent possible. ", "16570 MR. DUCHCHERER: I would think the biggest reason there would be to prevent competition. I don't know of another reason in my head why you wouldn't want to monetize an asset that you have if you can. ", "16571 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. ", "16572 With respect to future funding mechanisms and how they may be put into place, am I correct in understanding that you're advocating for an ongoing annual subsidy as opposed to a one time fund to build, or are both of those levers that we should be pushing on?", "16573 MR. BLACK: Our proposal is an annual capital fund, and I guess if it's annual capital versus operating, we could get into an accounting discussion over which is a capital expense and what's an operating expense. Not the purpose of today. ", "16574 But the concept was it would be for build out and it would be an annually recurring fund, so that there would be some assurance to the community that there would be capital funds available for that upgrade for that next mile, if you could bid on that and be successful in the next auction. ", "16575 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So predominantly, that funding would be going towards building that next mile out versus doing upgrades to those that already have service? Like would the funding be used to take someone from 5 megs to 10 or 15 or would it be used to get service down to the end of the road?", "16576 MR. BLACK: Subject to the mandate of the fund, you know, the priority would likely be, and our recommendation would be to serve those people that don't have the basic service level yet. And beyond that, if there were aspirational or additional speeds and feeds that were required in the market, then that would be a secondary use of that funding. ", "16577 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And that was the $45 to $65 million a year that you had mentioned. How did you arrive at those figures?", "16578 MR. DUCHCHERER: So the figure is an example-type figure, but essentially, what we did is take the last Connecting Canadians program, which was $305 million. At the time, we thought that was going to take us for five years, so we divided 305 million by 5 and came up with $60 million. ", "16579 Now, however, those things could have changed now because the Federal Government has allocated another 500 million or 500 million, however that is, so that figure is probably a little dynamic at the moment. ", "16580 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: With respect to the new $500 million -- obviously, those -- where that goes, those are decisions largely made across the river. Do you have any thoughts or best practices you can share on how that money should be distributed to ensure that smaller wireless providers, such as yourselves, can actually get access to it so it doesn't all go to one of the larger players?", "16581 MR. BLACK: Our members have been involved in a number of funding programs over the years, be it Connecting Canadians most recently, or the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, or even before that, Rural Connections or Rural Broadband Connections, I believe it was called. Some of our members would have input to that. ", "16582 Today, we don't have any immediately for you. We'd be happy to reply if that's something you would like, but we could canvass our members. ", "16583 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yeah, if you could just -- I think it would be helpful to find out when these funding schemes are put into place, and obviously, their specific criteria that need to met. ", "16584 MR. BLACK: M'hm. ", "16585 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Where the roadblocks are to smaller providers actually being able to take advantage of some of those funding programs that are put into place ---", "16586 MR. BLACK: M'hm. ", "16587 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- that would be helpful. ", "16588 ", "UNDERTAKING", "16589 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: With respect to where the money comes from, where should it come from? Is it best left to the taxpayers and government contributions, either at a federal, or provincial, or municipal level, or is it best handled through a contribution fund that service providers and their end customers would have to pay into?", "16590 MR. BLACK: I guess where I'd start is more is better, but more can also be more complicated. As you participate in funding for more sources, each of those sources may have their own requirements or hurdles that they want the recipient to fulfill. ", "16591 We've been involved in some projects with federal, provincial, and municipal funding and the number of hoops and reports that they all rightfully, you know, felt they needed made the overhead rather extreme. ", "16592 So I would say a couple of things: One, multiple levels of government are interested in this, and should likely participate; secondly, the industry, to be a world-recognized leader in providing service to all of Canadians, I would say the industry should also participate. ", "16593 Many funding programs today already come with a requirement for investment. I can speak to my company's experience. We -- we're a small company. We have taken part in approximately eight funding programs with three-and a half million dollars of funding and we've contributed just over two to two and a half million in our own capital. So we're willing to participate, and various levels of government, I would say, should also. ", "16594 We've also talked about the participation of major industry players who have some benefit from providing service in the higher density areas. So our answer would be more is better, not so many hoops that we can't get through them all, and we're willing to participate as well. ", "16595 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: What's the best way to bring all of those people to the table? You've got three levels of government, you've got ourselves, you've got service providers, people out building, research and education networks, power companies that own fibre. Like how do we get all the horses into the barn?", "16596 MR. BLACK: We've been thinking about that, as well as you have, and don't have a good answer for it. We do know some of the parties that we believe need to be around the table, and we've covered that in our recommendations. ", "16597 We -- I expect some of us will need to be pulled to the table and some -- because we are driven by our own markets. We want to -- our shareholders, whether they're private shareholders or public shareholders in stock markets, all want returns on their dollar. ", "16598 So some of us may need to be enticed and/or held to the -- chained to the table as we meet, but my guess is that could only come from a government source at some level. ", "16599 And you have your mandate, and ISED has their mandate, and the federal and provincial governments have their desires and mandates, so I think it would probably have to be a government-sponsored participation. But we have struggled with that, just like you are. ", "16600 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just a couple more questions before I hand you back over to my colleagues. ", "16601 With respect to voice services, in your original submission you stated that VoIP wasn't a substitute for traditional phone services. ", "16602 And I'm just wondering if -- I think we can all acknowledge the importance of a broadband, and if it can be delivered in a reliable way at a reliable speed should we still be contributing money towards rolling out, what some have described as legacy infrastructure, or should everything now on a -- in a world of convergence be provided over one broadband connection that gets one subsidy?", "16603 MR. DUCHCHERER: Did you indicate that we said VoIP was not an alternative?", "16604 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: That\u2019s what I read. I ---", "16605 MR. DUCHCHERER: Can you give me a reference to that, please, because I believe in my mind that we think VoIP is an alternative.", "16606 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Now, like some of my colleagues I\u2019m going from my own notes, which is always dangerous. Perhaps I should have been a doctor instead.", "16607 I can\u2019t find the -- I\u2019m just -- with respect to funding, there\u2019s still a significant amount of funding that goes towards delivering wireline voice services in high cost serving areas. And in a converged world, is it better to direct that funding towards providing stable broadband instead of running two pipes into the build and one for your voice services and then one for your broadband connection?", "16608 MR. DUCHCHERER: I believe that would definitely be the position of our organization. We believe broadband is delivering all those services today. Data, voice and video. So yes, we think one converged pipe is the answer.", "16609 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Okay. And just -- I know you\u2019ve got a few undertakings for the 5th, just one final one that we\u2019ve asked for from some other service providers, so perhaps you can canvass a few of your members to provide copies of their Internet service contracts, terms and conditions, acceptable use policies, things of that nature.", "16610 MR. DUCHCHERER: Absolutely.", "16611 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Okay.", "16612 ", "UNDERTAKING", "16613 COMMISSIONER MaCDONALD: Thank you very much. Those are my questions.", "16614 MR. DUCHCHERER: Thank you.", "16615 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "16616 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you and welcome. I understand this is your first time before the Commission so well done. You\u2019ve expressed your position well.", "16617 I want to just ask you the same question I asked the group before you, and that was as it regards if we were to define Internet as a basic service, and part of that definition was to include a minimum speed. One of the issues is that many companies sell speeds up to a certain level and clearly it\u2019s not delivered on a continual basis. So what are your thoughts as to how to address that within any kind of basic service definition?", "16618 MR. LUSSIER: So we actually discussed this question just before and I think I came up with the answer so I have to give the answer.", "16619 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I\u2019m so glad you have an answer.", "16620 MR. LUSSIER: I think it goes down to engineering basically because whether it\u2019s a limitation on the access or it\u2019s a limitation on the backhaul, you always have to engineer to a certain degree your network. So when you give a package, you give a package to -- up to five megabits per second. Well, it\u2019s going to be five megabits per second for most of the time. And since the -- on the wireless side -- and it is like that also on the other equipment, but it\u2019s not as obvious. It\u2019s shared time that you have to be on the network. So now our shared pipe is actually spectrum.", "16621 If we want to have a better five megabits per second insured for everyone at peak time when everybody\u2019s watching Netflix at 7 p.m., then you need to engineer your network properly. And coming back to what we said, it\u2019s about spectrum. The more spectrum we get, the better speed we can give, and then the engineering is done that way.", "16622 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Fair enough. And you\u2019re speaking about what would be required to meet a target level of basic service. In your case it\u2019s spectrum issues. In other cases it might be other issues. But what I\u2019m asking is what -- how in defining basic service, if we were to define it at a certain speed, what -- how should we define that?", "16623 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough to say it\u2019s -- the basic service is --", "16624 MR. LUSSIER: Up to.", "16625 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- up to 5 and 1 because everybody can say -- well, most people can say they deliver it, yet we\u2019ve seen folks come forward to say they actually achieve that speed 22 percent of the time.", "16626 MR. LUSSIER: Right.", "16627 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So what would be the appropriate way of defining the basic service so that it provides some means to deal with true peak periods and congestion that can occur, you know?", "16628 MR. LUSSIER: Yeah. Thank you for that clarification. I think it\u2019s the right approach.", "16629 The Government of Quebec had also the same question. And what we came up with was a percentage of the time. You know, it -- so you get five megabits per second for a percentage of the time. And, of course, you want it to be as close as -- to 100 as possible, but you know, you need to look at practicality as well.", "16630 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm. And so what did you come up with -- when you\u2019re participating in the government funding programs, do they define that?", "16631 MR. LUSSIER: I think it was -- well, I\u2019m not sure that we define it as per se, but we looked at 80 -- between 80 and 90 percent of the time.", "16632 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. And what about reliability? Another parameter to contain. I mean, the Telecom Act says you should have reliable service. So in defining reliability, what would you suggest might be appropriate parameters around this?", "16633 MR. BLACK: In a number of the government funding programs that have been in place, there are requirements and measurements that are required in regular reporting around things like up time, oversubscription ratios at various points in the network. All of those things feed into, you know, what you\u2019re coming out with at the other end at the consumer level.", "16634 I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen any end user measurement, but I don\u2019t know why there couldn\u2019t be. I think part of the issue would be the monitoring and measuring of that once you try to implement it.", "16635 Our members have -- as they have participate in government programs they have met those requirements as they were laid out at the beginning and they\u2019d be happy to do that going forward.", "16636 I know that SIRA is undertaking currently a measurement tool. They\u2019re putting out some measurements shortly about what the Internet speeds are based on provider and province. And I think they\u2019re actually going to be published soon. They could be a source, an independent source of verification and measurement.", "16637 So just to summarize, yes, there are requirements in existing government programs and our members are happy to sign up for that. Of course, as long as we understand them ahead of time.", "16638 To date, I\u2019m not aware of any that have actually stipulated a percentage of time at what bandwidth at the customer end.", "16639 All of the government programs have required a download and upload speed and a price and a data cap as a primary service offering that the successful recipient of the funding must maintain for the period of the contract. They are free to add packages or higher level packages or lower level packages, but typically there\u2019s one that must remain. Short of any cataclysmic change in Internet pricing, has not happened yet.", "16640 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Just to be clear, when I\u2019m asking my question, I understand that there are conditions around funding.", "16641 MR. BLACK: M\u2019hm.", "16642 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I mean, certainly it wouldn\u2019t be in anybody\u2019s best interest if we put in something that conflicted terribly with that. But there are also situations where Canadians are served without funding, both in high cost areas and in urban areas. But you know, if we kind of focus on the rural and remote because that\u2019s your world right now.", "16643 There are situations and technologies where service has been extended without subsidy.", "16644 MR. BLACK: M\u2019hm.", "16645 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And there\u2019s situations, as you know, well, where the funding has expired. You know, it\u2019s like a five-term. It\u2019s a capital build and you\u2019re an ongoing --", "16646 MR. BLACK: Yeah.", "16647 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- operator.", "16648 So what I\u2019m looking at is from the perspective of the consumer that when they\u2019re making a contract they understand, what is the service levels they expect? What is the basic that as, you know, as a Canadian telecom consumer they can expect? That doesn\u2019t mean over the term of a capital build contract. It means over ongoing.", "16649 So from that perspective, you know, they could expect that their service would be available at the speed they\u2019ve contracted a certain percentage of time.", "16650 MR. BLACK: That\u2019s right.", "16651 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: They can expect that it would be up. It would be reliable.", "16652 MR. BLACK: M\u2019hm.", "16653 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: They can expect it potentially would be -- any service outages would be limited to a certain amount; otherwise, they would be, you know, perhaps eligible for a refund of some of their service. Those are -- that\u2019s kind of the lense I have on ---", "16654 MR. BLACK: M'hm.", "16655 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- when I'm asking.", "16656 MR. BLACK: It\u2019s almost a consumer protection issue or a consumer rights issue, not unlike whatever contract we may make with any other kind of service provider. So we -- we don\u2019t have recommendations today on what those metrics would be. If that\u2019s something you would like us to look at, we certainly could.", "16657 Guy, you had mentioned that in the case of Quebec they were looking at receiving the purchased speed 80 to 90 percent of the time, I realize that\u2019s a fair gap, but it is a metric, it is a line in the sand.", "16658 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Sure, if you want to undertake to provide your thoughts on what that -- exactly, I'm looking at it from the consumer perspective.", "16659 MR. BLACK: M'hm.", "16660 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: If we\u2019re defining basic telecom service, it is from the consumer\u2019s perspective. Thank you.", "16661 THE CHAIRPERSON: So you can do that for May 5th?", "16662 MR. DUCHCHERER: We will take that on, yes.", "16663 ", "UNDERTAKING", "16664 THE CHAIRPERSON: And while you're at it, when you talk 80 or 90 percent of the time, think about when people are online. So I take it your ---", "16665 MR. DUCHCHERER: Of course.", "16666 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- 80 percent is on a 24-hour period. So that\u2019s actually a lower threshold than saying 80 percent between -- I don\u2019t know, excluding midnight to 5 a.m., where maybe people aren\u2019t as connected because they're doing other things.", "16667 MR. DUCHCHERER: We\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll put some thought into that for sure.", "16668 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, okay.", "16669 MR.

That is something that we thought upon seeing that suggestion was a good idea, a good potential idea.", "16774 You know we don\u2019t have a -- I think it needs to be studied further as to what\u2019s more -- what\u2019s a better system to use, what\u2019s a more efficient program to implement, but I think that is one potential idea that could work.", "16775 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "16776 MR. YAM: And it could -- there are funding -- sorry, there are funding mechanisms that exist that could help create such a fund.", "16777 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. Well we\u2019re developing quite an extensive record on this issue. ", "16778 If you think the Commission should do something in this area you at least have the potential of taking a clear position on the 25th of May or on the 13th of June on the issue, so that would be very helpful.", "16798 MR. YAM: Sorry, I was just catching up to the translation there. ", "16799 Absolutely we do support that adoption. I think we may have -- we might be separating two different issues, because you\u2019re speaking about the role of the CRTC and people adopting the technology. ", "16800 I think when we flip it around people have already adopted the technology and the demand is there, which is why we\u2019re seeing more of these services provided online, which is why we see more people taking courses online for college or university degrees, why government services are being shifted more toward online. ", "16801 So I think it\u2019s actually a reflection of what the demand actually is, whether we are talking about the younger generation or older generation. ", "16802 There have been other studies that have found that online use is increasing for all age groups.", "16803 You know, there will be individual cases, of course, where someone, you know, my grandmother, for example, needs to figure out how to use her iPad, but at the end of the day, you know, it\u2019s almost like the \u201cif you build it they will come\u201d kind of point, but at the same time people are already there so we almost have to build it to catch up to them.", "16804 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So you -- I just want to make sure that I understand. In your view, adoptability is not an issue that is significant enough for us or anyone else to be concerned about?", "16805 MR. YAM: No, it is something to be concerned about, but we need to provide that access.", "16806 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well then what do we do about it? ", "16807 MR. YAM: I\u2019m sorry?", "16808 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, well then what do we do about it?", "16809 MR. YAM: We need to first provide the ---", "16810 THE CHAIRPERSON: And the \u201cwe\u201d is not just the CRTC. ", "16811 MR. YAM: Yes. We need to first provide the access. That\u2019s the fundamental point where we have to start, because if you don\u2019t provide the access there is nothing to adopt. ", "16812 So that\u2019s kind of where our focus has been. Yes.", "16813 MS. RIZVI: Hi, sorry. ", "16814 So I guess from my own standpoint, from a personal level, in terms of adoptability our members who are, you know, Bell -- BTS technicians, Bell Technical Solutions technicians, often go into residential customers\u2019 homes and, you know, put in modems and smart hubs and all kinds of different smart technology to, you know, give accessibility of services.", "16815 And in my own home when I was getting, you know, internet services put in when we moved, my father who\u2019s 82 and my mom who is 70, who would not touch the internet, would not bank anywhere except going to stand in line, started having a conversation with the technician who was telling them \u201coh it\u2019s really easy to work this. I can explain it to you\u201d. ", "16816 And by the time we came home from work, you know, my dad was working a smart hub on, you know, on the T.V. and was explaining to me how the smart T.V. works, which is unbelievable at 82 in like, you know, a 5 minute lesson.", "16817 So we went out and bought him an iPad Air for Christmas and they do all of -- now they do all of their banking online. ", "16818 So adoptability is there even for somebody who\u2019s retired and never was -- never moved with the internet from the point where, you know, we had dialup service so that they have a comfort level to where we are now.", "16819 My parents are completely online. They are in social media. They are on Facebook. They are now connected with people back home, their cousins and their family, and, you know, they post pictures from their smartphones.", "16820 So I think the adoptability piece, if -- you know, I support Mike\u2019s piece on it. As long as it's accessible and somebody takes the time to explain it, and that's one thing that our members do really well. When they go into the residential homes, they explain to the customers really easily how to use the functions.", "16821 So I think that the initial fear sometimes on the adoptability piece really is overcome quite quickly and there's nothing easier than, you know, using your finger on an iPad and suddenly you have like the world at your fingertips.", "16822 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, but you still an iPad and a smartphone and, I mean, one could say that my parents, your parents, most of the folks in this room are on the upper end of the socio-economic spectrum and that my question also deals with those that may not have the economic access to those.", "16823 If you have an iPhone or and iPad, there's a better chance that you'll have a network around you, right, to help. So my question about adoptability also goes to other more vulnerable people in society. So what are your views on that?", "16824 MR. YAM: It's an excellent question actually and a very complex one I think.", "16825 You know, Naureen was just talking about the role of our members when they're helping customers out with their service and that is an important interaction. So that's work that a lot of folks already do. It's people who are able to get that service and it could just be a conversation between a technical person and installing the network and talking to the customer. And there are also customer service representatives who play that role for various companies.", "16826 It is worth looking at low-income adoption but that is intricately related to low-income connectivity. So we almost -- they are not the same issues but they're so related that, you know, we do have to address the basic -- I think that basic need to connect first.", "16827 THE CHAIRPERSON: M\u2019hm.", "16828 MR. YAM: And we can still have that conversation obviously and we still think it's important but it is a really complex question there. I don\u2019t think there is a simple, you know, silver bullet answer to it.", "16860 We will now hear the presentation of Kootenay Boundary Broadband Committee.", "16861 Mr. Gay, can you hear me?", "16862 MR. GAY: Yes, thank you very much, Madam.", "16863 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "16864 You may begin your presentation. You have 10 minutes.", "16865 MR. GAY: Okay, thank you for the invitation.", "PRESENTATION", "16866 MR. GAY: Just for a kind of a quick backgrounder. I'm a politician, what we call a rural politician in the area of the Kootenay's.", "16867 So I am speaking on -- today on behalf of our Columbia Basin-Boundary Regional Broadband Committee, which is composed of the chairs of four regional governments within the East Kootenay's, as well as our Ktunaxa Nation Council, the local Indian band, and the Village of Valemount.", "16868 Our Committee of elected community leaders came together as local government and First Nations representatives for a very rural region \u2013- the southeast corner of British Columbia. We came together because we see every day the lack of adequate broadband service, that it impedes our region's social and economic development and affects our region and our residents' future.", "16869 Our region has a low population density and extremely mountainous topography with dense forest vegetation. These factors make telecommunications infrastructure expensive, with little potential for short-term investment return. As a consequence, we have a limited -- the investments by major carriers and service providers have been limited and many areas of the region remain seriously underserved.", "16870 And I did hear -- overhear your conversation. I was pleased to be able to listen in, and I think, you know, your committee has summed it up very well around, you know, the new job creation and the employment opportunities, as well as the opportunities of our youth staying home. We see a lot of out migration just because we can't provide those types of jobs within our communities.", "16871 Our region is home to many beautiful communities, surrounded by natural amenities. We have ski hills; we have camping, mountain bike trails. Very much moved from a resource base to trying to -- you know, we remain with sawmills and mines, but we're trying to bring the tourism industry to us as well.", "16872 We'd also like to take advantage of this knowledge-based economy and have people that can live at home and do their jobs. And we have -- we're starting to see many home based businesses and good jobs created, but we need broadband infrastructure services that are affordable and available to attract those individuals.", "16873 So for your consideration, and based on our region's experience over the last four or five years, I am going to provide you some recommendations and surely able to defend somebody's points should you wish.", "16874 So we have been very fortunate. We did get some federal funding programs for our ISPs. We have a local organization called Columbia Basin Trust, which was a trust account set up years ago because of the impact on our region from power generation dams. The trust has been managed very well. Right now, they invest up to $40 million a year within the Basin and they have a side company called Columbia Basin Broadband Corp.", "16875 Without this corporation's help guiding our small ISPs through the process, we would never have been able to get these grants. So we appreciate the grants, but again, we recommend that they shouldn't be just one time funding or programs that come up every five years. I think we need to be able to count on them a little more, like something like the gas tax, which we have a 10 year agreement with the federal government on.", "16876 Within these programs, as I mentioned, without this Columbia Basin Broadband, we would never have been able to access this fund. We don't dismiss the need for accountability and transparency, but some of the barriers are very, very difficult, and so that was something I'd like to point out.", "16877 We do have the large telecoms and they have infrastructure in our area. In fact, many of our small towns see broadband or wireless going right through the area and we're not able to access it.", "16878 Oh, I'm sorry -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.", "16879 THE SECRETARY: Mr. Gay?", "16880 THE CHAIRPERSON: Can you still hear us?", "16881 MR. GAY: Yes, we can hear you very well.", "16882 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, we lost you for a little while there.", "16883 MR. GAY: Okay. Maybe we need more than just broadband. How am I now? I'll put my ---", "16884 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, it's fine right now. You just -- it's ---", "16885 MR. GAY: Okay, is that better?", "16886 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, that's perfect. Keep going.", "16887 MR. GAY: Okay.", "16888 So I'll -- maybe I'll just read the recommendations.", "16889 So the first one was regarding the federal funding to the ISPs. And we very much appreciate it. We've been successful to get a program here, but without the hard work of a local trust that we've got, our ISPs being small companies would never have been able to access. So what we would see the Government with creating kind of a permanent long-term fund until all areas of our beautiful country are serviced.", "16890 The other thing that I wanted to talk about briefly is the large incumbent telecoms that do exist in our area. Now, we've got either wired -- mostly wired throughout our region, but many of these small communities can't access it. So Telus goes through our area or Shaw goes through our area and it frustrates the people.", "16891 And what we see -- and I'm sure you folks experience, and I heard you discussing business models -- where these large telecoms will come in. There'll be enough in an area, enough population density that they'll serve, let's say, a 1 kilometre square radius, take the majority of the clients that the small ISPs had, kind of cream of the crop that way, and then leave those on the fringes of that 1 kilometre radius to have very, very poor service or none at all.", "16892 So we suggest, and I don't know how the CRTC does that, but somehow to open access. That infrastructure, if it's not going to be used by these telecoms, that some local company be able to access as a reasonable rate.", "16893 And then the last question is the Internet speeds. And when I heard -- overheard your -- the Commission speaking, as well as the presenters, about, you know, about the economic impact of it, and the whole global economy.", "16894 And really, when we look around, you know, we're hoping -- and five is nice, it's a lot better than one, and I know it's going to take us to get more, but we really need something we see -- quite a lot quicker. We see a lot of the developing countries have skipped over those stages and have gone to, you know, 30 or 50, United States, the largest carriers offer up to 250, and again, at competitive prices, but if people and businesses need those high speeds they can pay for them.", "16895 So that was kind of my main messages today. Again, a very rural community in Southern Canada. And we always hear, you know, the rural and remote and people gravitate to the North, and then the North needs all the help. And there are, I think, small areas, and granted, I think we're getting better at it within Canada, that we have very many challenges on satellite and still people on dialup and others that can't have access.", "16896 And I think as we've all learned, this is just, as I mentioned at the beginning. We're in -- I'm in government. We provide water services, we provide sewer, solid waste management, and Internet to our local residents is seen just as an essential service as any of those services that took time to, you know, to be a part of Canada and our system and I think Internet is certainly there.", "16897 So I\u2019ll conclude with that and thank you very much for your time.", "16898 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for that presentation.", "16899 So Commissioner Vennard will start us off.", "16900 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Hello, Mr. Gay. This is Commissioner Vennard speaking.", "16901 MR. GAY: Hello.", "16902 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Hello.", "16903 I have several areas that I\u2019d like to focus on and have a conversation with you about. The first one is basically so that I can -- we can get a little bit better understanding of your particular organization and your area, some of the challenges and some of the -- also some of the success -- elements of success that you have enjoyed as well.", "16904 All through our hearings we\u2019ve been hearing from different groups that are banding together and they\u2019re forming all sorts of different kinds of relationships and partnerships with different goals and different objectives and so on. So that\u2019s basically what I\u2019d like to just start to talk to you about.", "16905 But first of all, I\u2019d like you to tell us a little bit more about your area. For example, the size of your region, how many communities you have, how many residents?", "16906 MR. GAY: Oh, okay. And I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re afforded there that briefing note piece that was made available. Now I don\u2019t know if you have it. And that might be useful. It\u2019s a short two-pager.", "16907 But our area if -- I don\u2019t know how many of you folks are familiar with British Columbia, but we\u2019re in the extreme southeast. So we\u2019re bordered by the State of Montana and Idaho and Washington to our south, and then we border with Alberta. So the Rocky Mountains is Hereford Mountains for cell phones.", "16908 So the total area that we\u2019re serving -- and we call them regional districts. So in British Columbia what happens is they -- the municipal governments in the rural electoral areas directors get together and they form a regional government. So it\u2019s a large geographic area in terms of hundreds of square kilometres. But our population that we\u2019re serving under this committee is probably about 125,000. And that is based in 26 different communities. And our communities range in size from about 400 people to Cranbrook, B.C., which is the largest, which is just about 20,000. So we considered ourselves all rural.", "16909 And we\u2019re very much valley people. We\u2019re surrounded by mountain passes and we live in the valley. So and the valleys aren\u2019t always running north/south. So again, when we look at trying to do broadband servicing, it\u2019s, you know, even if we go with the microwave towers, we need a number of towers and they can be quite expensive. So that\u2019s ---", "16910 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you go -- does your area go all the way up to Radium? Do you go over to the Shuswap, over to Penticton?", "16911 MR. GAY: Yes. Yes. So you know the area. So we go --", "16912 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16913 MR. GAY: -- we go to a little place called Field, actually, in the Yoho National Park.", "16914 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Oh, really.", "16915 MR. GAY: Yes. So we go to Field and then Valemount is a partner of ours. And then we cut through the Arrow Lake area and then down to the Boundary country, which Grand Forks is in. So yeah, so that\u2019s the area. So four regional districts, one tribal council in the Valemount and then our other partner that I should talk about -- and Aimee, are you on?", "16916 Okay. She was going to try to join. But Aimee ---", "16917 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: We can maybe get that more -- more into that when we talk about your organization. Right now I\u2019m just --", "16918 MR. GAY: Yes.", "16919 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: -- trying to get for our record the size and the variety of the communities that you covered. You also include the Okanagan in your area?", "16920 MR. GAY: No, no. We -- so we border on the Okanagan. And so we just --", "16921 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "16922 MR. GAY: -- form the Kootenay regions.", "16923 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. You have quite a variety of communities in there and different things going on.", "16924 MR. GAY: We do. The other thing that we have and that may be of note is we\u2019re one -- actually, the oldest region in Canada. We\u2019re -- 25 percent of our people right now are 65 years of age or older.", "16925 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "16926 MR. GAY: And that\u2019s for a couple reasons. But the main one, in my view, is that our young people leave. They go to Calgary or Vancouver or Kelowna.", "16927 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16928 MR. GAY: Sometimes, you know, because they like the urban lifestyle, but often it\u2019s for the job opportunities.", "16929 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16930 MR. GAY: And we see them coming back sometimes in retirement. So again, services for our seniors around public safety, around medicine, the Internet can play a huge role.", "16931 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. That\u2019s what I was going to ask you about next. Your primary businesses in an area as large and diverse as that, it\u2019s -- obviously those are quite varied as well.", "16932 So tell us a little bit about the number and the types of businesses that you have within this region, within your area.", "16933 MR. GAY: Yeah, I would say that we\u2019re very entrepreneurial. And I spent 12 years of my life doing business -- lending to small business. I probably have a soft spot to that. But we have some large businesses. Teck Metals, for example, has five mines in our Elkview area, as well as a large smelter in Trail, B.C. It used to be called Cominco years ago.", "16934 So they depend on a lot of small businesses for servicing, and larger businesses. So folks like Caterpillar and the larger suppliers are located in those mining towns. And it goes everywhere from contract janitorial services to welding services. So a lot of tradesmen reside in our area.", "16935 We also have -- we have -- our competition, although it\u2019s turned around, is -- because we\u2019re on the American border we see a lot of our money going out. Because in the State of Montana, for example, there is no state tax at all. So --", "16936 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "16937 MR. GAY: -- where in British Columbia it\u2019s 12 percent. And again, people gravitate to Alberta because there\u2019s no provincial tax there. So very competitive world for our business communities. ", "16938 But we\u2019ve got one area, the Creston Valley, it\u2019s heavily into agriculture and they\u2019re seeing some movement into the wine industry now with the climate changing the way it is. Education is a large part of it. We have two main colleges in our area. Maturing Health -- as I mentioned a lot of seniors, so Maturing Health is our health provider. And probably would be the second largest employer after the mines.", "16939 And then, you know, we have, you know, all the banks and I guess all the fast food chains and, you know, in our area.", "16940 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: You have a fairly vibrant tourist economy there as well; don\u2019t you?", "16941 MR. GAY: We do. We have a number of what we call resort municipalities.", "16942 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "16943 MR. GAY: They\u2019re -- and they provide -- they have ski hills.", "16944 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "16945 MR. GAY: So we do quite well. And then we\u2019ve moved heavily into the golf business.", "16946 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16947 MR. GAY: So we have the shoulder seasons that are slow, but the winter and summer months are pretty good.", "16948 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. What do you find -- and just to use as an example, the Columbia Valley and all the golf resorts down through there. Obviously there\u2019s a big influx of people when it\u2019s golf season and so on. What sort of challenges do you find with your broadband at that time?", "16949 MR. GAY: So that\u2019s a really good question. And just to give you some perspective on this Columbia Valley for the folks that don\u2019t know it. It\u2019s kind of a playground of Calgary, for the most part. Sixty-seven (67) percent of the homes in the Columbia Valley are second home owners. So very large part of our tax base.", "16950 And what happens is these individuals -- and many of them are fairly affluent because they have second homes, come from Calgary and, like all of us, you know, take our cell phones or laptops or computers and want to do some work when they\u2019re home. So they come from a city that has service of I don\u2019t know what, you know, to the rural area that is freely hit and miss. And it\u2019s a frustration for them.", "16951 And we\u2019ve tried to have a bit of a campaign to say this is a good place to raise your kids. It\u2019s affordable. Why don\u2019t you move here and work from home four days a week and run into Calgary once or twice a month instead of the opposite. And people would like to do that.", "16952 And they\u2019ve said, \u201cIf we can get the broadband service that could connect us with our office, we would actually relocate to our seasonal homes.\u201d And many of these seasonal homes are not the cabin by the lake. They\u2019re --", "16953 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16954 MR. GAY: -- you know, 500,000 to even a million dollars in some cases. So they\u2019re year-round residences. ", "16955 So there\u2019s a real frustration from those folks. And then in a situation where the locals have been depending on kind of a dial up that, you know, when there are three of us are home it\u2019s not a problem. But in the weekends and during the summer when all the other residents come out, now we\u2019re slowed right down to a walk. You\u2019ve I\u2019m sure heard that story as well so.", "16956 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16957 MR. GAY: So yeah, having them seasonal residents become permanent residents would be something that we value. Because these folks that come in and out, they\u2019re not assisting in terms of the volunteerism that we need. They feel part of the community to some extent, but, you know, it\u2019d be nice if they could raise their kids in our area here.", "16958 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. How do you find that connects in with emergency services and so on with your ---", "16959 MR. GAY: As I say, they -- in some cases these people are very well linked with their community. So let\u2019s just say we need to fundraise for a new emergency vehicle. Well, they\u2019re very apt with that. They can bring in talented musicians or whatever and they can fundraise real well. So I won\u2019t say they don\u2019t contribute to it. ", "16960 But their expectations are city expectations. And we\u2019re, for the most part, country boys. And, you know, if you phone an ambulance it\u2019s not going to be there right away because we don\u2019t have full-time ambulance people and we don\u2019t have full-time firemen and they are a rural fire department. So it takes 10 or 15 minutes for people to, you know, get to the fire hall and get the ambulance or to get the fire trucks. So --", "16961 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16962 MR. GAY: -- it -- they\u2019re -- you know, there\u2019s -- I guess there\u2019s, you know, you live in a certain world and we have a different set of standards.", "16963 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. Thanks for that description and enlightening us as to what\u2019s it like there because I was going to ask, what does even the concept of the digital economy mean for an area like yours?", "16964 MR. GAY: Well, you know, I -- and I know it\u2019s important in the city, but I\u2019ve been thinking in rural Canada we\u2019ve come to depend on, in a lot of ways -- and I heard somebody earlier, you know, explain how their parents are doing banking. And what we see is one of the issues of getting old, and as I mentioned, we have an older population, is the loneliness factor. ", "16965 And, you know, and our libraries have really come forward to help train our seniors. And you can go to our library this afternoon and there\u2019ll probably be 20 seniors because that\u2019s all they can fit around the table, and some younger people, learning to share photos, to get on the social Internet. And much of that is because of the loneliness. ", "16966 But because they\u2019re on there, you know, they can check with their doctor. We\u2019ve got some telemedicine now that\u2019s really starting to take off in rural British Columbia where people could, you know, check in with the doctor 24 hours a day. And these doctors are anywhere. They could be in your province. So that\u2019s a good move.", "16967 In terms of public safety, something that I\u2019m responsible for, you know, we have a high risk of forest fire here some years.", "16968 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M\u2019hm.", "16969 MR. GAY: So to get messages out in a timely manner. So it\u2019s really given us a better quality of life and we\u2019ve really come to depend on it.", "16970 People in our area know that I\u2019ve been Chair of this Broadband Committee and expect that they could phone me and I\u2019ll solve all their problems. And we see the solution from the private sector and government really doesn\u2019t need to be in here except providing some leverage money to help the businesses go. ", "16971 So yeah, so it\u2019s -- I think like the rest of Canada it\u2019s very much a part of it. You go to our schools and every kid\u2019s got their cell phone and they\u2019re all, you know, playing games and the stuff. So I think it\u2019s really levelled the playing field, probably not only for Canada, but for globally.", "16972 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Are you -- I want to talk a little bit about your organization next. Are you connected to the Highway 3 economic development that\u2019s going on in southern Alberta, that group?", "16973 MR. GAY: No.", "16974 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: No.", "16975 MR. GAY: No.", "16976 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "16977 MR. GAY: We know the Highway 3 group just through -- actually, Highway 3 because we\u2019d have a mayors and --", "16978 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "16979 MR. GAY: -- chairs committee that advises government on a priority fund highway upgrade. But beyond that, no.", "16980 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about the structure and the history of your organization, how you came together, what sort of governance structure you have, you know, that sort of thing. Just give us an idea of what your particular organization is about.", "16981 MR. GAY: Yeah, so you know, there -- when there was a problem there, I think what we each had to do in our area here is we don\u2019t ask for other orders of government to solve the problem. We get in and then decide what we need.", "16982 So what would happen is this was a frustration of everybody, sort of the lack of broadband connectivity, the way that the telecoms were coming in and cherry picking some of the communities and making them sign onto multi-year deals so there was no competition. ", "16983 So four of the chairs of the regional district, we were at a meeting together and we got together and said there\u2019s stuff that we could do. So in I think 2013 we agreed to meet essentially at a little town called Creston. Invited the First Nations who are a big part of our business and we had -- the Provincial Minister of Economic Development joined us as well as this Columbia Basin Trust. So a very small group, like just six of us. And we sat down and we kind of did an analysis. ", "16984 And our municipalities were part of the discussion but they weren\u2019t the one that lacked the service. It was on the -- always on the edges. So the main community of Cranbrook, for example, has pretty good speed. But on the edges they don\u2019t. And so the money that we\u2019ve gotten from the federal government, just to put perspective, is helping about 12,100 homes over that big area. So those were the ones that were -- either had no service or had very poor service.", "16985 So anyway, we got together. Our governance is very easy. We try to just come to agreements. We pay our own expenses. The Columbia Basin Trust supplies the meeting room. So and we have a memorandum of understanding and it\u2019s about a page and a half long. And we are advocates.", "16986 And one of the things that we wanted to do and where we thought we end is we were going to do a strategic plan and sort of portray the -- how big the problem was and some solutions then leave it at that. So we did.", "16987 And we said this is what we need. So we looked around our region and we said, well, who could implement this? And there was really nobody. So we said, let\u2019s go to step two. And this is just when the Connecting Canadians ---", "16988 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Can you tell us a little bit about what your strategic plan was at that time? You developed that around 2013 or so?", "16989 MR. GAY: Yes. I don\u2019t have it in front of me, but basically, the key objectives was affordable Internet to everybody in our region that wanted it. Because there are a few hang-ups that, you know, I never wanted and stuff and we would probably see a percentage of that. We didn\u2019t define affordable and we wanted it by 2016. So we put a timeline on it. And that\u2019s what we wanted. ", "16990 And then we have the backup, the rationale for it around health, public safety, education, economic development, you know, the reasons that you hear a lot of. Well, we rolled that into that. So we tried to boil that down to a one-page and then -- and went to work.", "16991 And just at our same time, Network BC was -- which is our provincial for us that we\u2019ve actually met with our provincial minister as we rolled this out, and we also met with our MP, who at the time was David Wilks, who was Conservative MP, was very supportive. So, you know, because we\u2019re in politics we sort of did that, that sort of advocacy role. ", "16992 And then from that point, that was just when the Connecting Canadians program came along. So we were fortunate to find a gentleman in Vancouver that had been through it before. We brought him on board through money from this Trust. And we let all the ISPs know. There was 23 people made application to us. We sat down with them and it turned out only 13 wanted to move forward. ", "16993 And I remember working right through Christmas because, I mean, the deadline for that was early January and we got our submission in. We got -- we were able to access quite a few million dollars that\u2019s getting put on the ground as we speak this year.", "16994 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Can you tell us a little bit about the fund that you mentioned? The Trust, where the money came from and who\u2019s involved in that?", "16995 MR. GAY: Yeah. So I don\u2019t know, again ---", "16996 MS. AMBROSONE: Rob, I\u2019ll just say that I\u2019ve joined just so you know.", "16997 MR. GAY: Oh, okay. Aimee, that\u2019s great. ", "16998 So Aimee Ambrosone is the Chair of the Columbia Basis Broadband Corporation, which is an offshoot from the Trust. So I\u2019ll turn that over to Aimee.", "16999 But just to give you a little background. If you can envision, and I mentioned that were a series of valley living people. So we live in these valleys and these valleys have rivers. And many years ago our government decided that we needed more electricity in our province and we have lots of rivers and lots of steep valleys. And they basically dammed a lot of our valleys up, displaced a number of residents. Still hard feelings after 25 or 30 -- 40 years actually now.", "17000 But a trust was set up to help compensate us. And over the years this has been managed very well. And, you know, they -- they\u2019re able to put, you know, upwards of -- I think last year was 26 million, but their revenue\u2019s gone up -- back into the basin for the legacy of our residents. ", "17001 So I\u2019ll let Aimee discuss what the Columbia Basin Broadband Corporation is.", "17002 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "17003 MR. GAY: It\u2019s really -- we wouldn\u2019t have been able to access any of these federal or provincial programs without their technical knowledge and their ability to provide competent staff. So Aimee.", "17004 MS. AMBROSONE: Thank you, Rob. ", "17005 So Columbia Basin Trust, just to add to what Rob was saying, is -- its sole shareholder is the Province of B.C. It was created under statutory legislation in the Province of B.C. in 1995. And its purpose is to return social, environmental and economic benefit to the region that was most impacted by the Columbia River Treaty and, as Rob alluded to, the damming of rivers in this area and the impact that arose from that.", "17006 It essentially has, not unlike a major community foundation or a Vancouver foundation, it has an investment portfolio, a very different kind of investment portfolio. The returns from its investments fund our corporate operation and they fund all that -- all of that money that Rob mentioned that\u2019s flowing out to communities, they fund all of our work in communities.", "17007 We give grants. We develop partnership. And depending on what communities express as their priority and need -- and we take our cues from them in terms of where we should focus our efforts. We\u2019re responsive to what the region needs. ", "17008 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So does that -- would that include infrastructure like new community halls?", "17009 MS. AMBROSONE: Absolutely.", "17010 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: What about things like roads and so on? Does that maintain or ---", "17011 MS. AMBROSONE: Typically we don\u2019t play a role -- we don\u2019t -- wouldn\u2019t do anything in sort of the roadway or the sewer kind of base. We would say, you know, that\u2019s more the responsibility of government as opposed to our responsibility. Yeah.", "17012 So we do things that range from literacy programs to ---", "17013 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Hang on. Hang on for a sec. My mic was off.", "17014 So infrastructure, communications infrastructure is part of the infrastructure that you would fund? Although it wouldn\u2019t be roads and so on, but communications infrastructures you would fund?", "17015 MS. AMBROSONE: Indeed. So broadband emerged as a priority in our region.", "17016 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "17017 MS. AMBROSONE: There was a lot of interest, not only from the group that Rob mentioned, but other communities. And our organization chose in 2011 to play a role in this space. It created a wholly owned subsidiary called Columbia Basin Broadband. And that entity is building and managing a regional high-speed fibre optic network throughout the southeastern corner of British Columbia. Our network has a 724 kilometre footprint. And it extends from Rossland in the west, as far north as Canal Flats in the east, and over to the community of Elkford. ", "17018 So Columbia Basin Trust recognized that broadband was priority, created an entity, Columbia Basin Broadband to build this network, to light it up, and to drive better Internet service into rural communities in our region.", "17019 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so communities in your region would make application to you for these funds and you would fund it and?", "17020 MS. AMBROSONE: We build and own the regional network ourselves. It's our own asset, right.", "17021 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "17022 MS. AMBROSONE: The communities, to interconnect us, if we were bringing service -- if our fibre network went by a small rural community, we could interconnect to an ISP's last mile infrastructure there. And we in fact are giving some grant dollars to those last mile ISPs to upgrade their own last mile infrastructure, which is primarily wireless.", "17023 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so how large is this -- is that corporation? How many employees do you have?", "17024 MS. AMBROSONE: The Columbia Basin Trust has over 40 staff. We've got a website, www.cbt.org, and some good publications out there. The wholly owned subsidiary, Columbia Basin Broadband, is, I think, four or five staff within our -- we're essentially a department of the trust and our operating support comes from the trust.", "17025 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, and with that many people, you've managed to create a broadband network out there?", "17026 MS. AMBROSONE: Indeed.", "17027 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "17028 MS. AMBROSONE: Yes, a lot of really good contract support.", "17029 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, well, that's interesting.", "17030 MS. AMBROSONE: Yes.", "17031 MR. GAY: And I think just to mention that, you know, a lot of this work is done through, you know, through you -- you have spoken to have many of them. But some of these Internet service providers are these small not for profits that probably in the past have been a company that provided TV service to the community.", "17032 So they're very unsophisticated but have some real technical expertise. So it's not sophisticated in the way of getting grants from government, but Columbia Basin Broadband and through Aimee's work have been able to, you know, go to these folks' door and work with them and make it happen. So it's really a homegrown solution.", "17033 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So what percentage would you say of your region is covered?", "17034 MS. AMBROSONE: Well, it's interesting that you asked that. We're just going through some mapping work ourselves relative to that, because it's very difficult to have granular data, particularly given mountainous topography. The fact that most wireless ISPs use -- unlike spectrum, because they, you know, don't have the maintenance, really the financial wherewithal (inaudible) through licensing process, there is issues around line of sight and those kinds of things.", "17035 So there is data out there, and I know that the Government of Canada plays a role in maintaining and managing that data. We think there are accuracy issues with it.", "17036 And a good example would be within a community, and let's say a community in our region, the largest is Cranbrook, an incorporated municipality would range between say a population of 500 to Cranbrook, which has about 18,000 or so people.", "17037 Within a community proper, usually you will find an incumbent telco will have infrastructure there that serves residents over -- beyond the 5 meg current minimum from the federal government. But in the surrounding areas, the areas immediately outside that town, you'll find that there is lots of residents that have less than 5 megs download speed because they are receiving service from a wireless telco.", "17038 Under our project, which is being funded through the Connecting Canadians program, and we're working with 12 ISPs and the group that Rob mentioned, we're going to bring 11,000 households in the region up to that 5 meg threshold. But there still will be a number of households again that aren't reached given the nature of our topography, given the nature of, you know, where there's a business case to reach them that aren't served.", "17039 And we're actually going through looking at doing some granular work on getting a number around that. It's a hard number to come up with, just because of the geography and the infrastructure (inaudible).", "17040 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Does your region have the sort of thing, I don't know how closely you've been following our hearings, but we've been hearing about unserviced sort of pockets of houses and so on?", "17041 MS. AMBROSONE: And very much so. Exactly that, yeah.", "17042 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, yeah.", "17043 MS. AMBROSONE: Yes, exactly that.", "17044 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: And so do you have a plan or a strategy to fill in those gaps or to service those people?", "17045 MS. AMBROSONE: Well, our goal with our broadband initiative, it's a priority for the trust that they've set for the next five years. We've already built out a significant regional network, we're working on a significant federal project in partnership with local ISPs, so those are good strides forward.", "17046 But we're in this for the long haul. So we're looking at, okay, you know, what piece is next, where does it make sense to potentially expand the network, where does it make sense to potentially work with other ISPs that maybe didn't participate with us in the last federal project.", "17047 So when you say a plan, yes, there's a number of fronts that we're working through in terms of due diligence to say, okay, what next in terms of how to ensure that we can get service.", "17048 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "17049 MR. GAY: One thing I might add to that, because money is always a factor.", "17050 MS. AMBROSONE: Absolutely.", "17051 MR. GAY: And we were quite fortunate that for a municipality in British Columbia, and I think probably across Canada, we always -- we get a share of federal gas tax money. And in the past, it was always for sewer and water, and the list of eligible activities is very short. In fact, I think there was only three things on it.", "17052 Now, we that have renegotiated the agreement we have about 12 things on the list. And one thing on the list, which means we could use this federal money for, is for Internet and broadband connectivity. So that was seen within that program.", "17053 So for an example, Aimee was talking about some of these people in this area that have -- don't have service, they may put a community group together and say, well, for another -- if we can just $30,000 we could do a tower and we can work with this guy. Well, we've got the $30,000 now for that community, so there's a link to that funding.", "17054 So it's really nice to see that the federal government has allowed, you know, more eligible activities and that broadband is one of them. And we fought hard for many years to do that, meeting with different MPs and ministers and that, and so at least in our area that's a source of funding. And most of the rural directors in our small municipalities are willing to put money toward it.", "17055 So when we had to match this federal money we had 22 different electoral areas come forward and put some money on the table. So that makes things happen as well.", "17056 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, what's the price of the packages?", "17057 MS. AMBROSONE: They're variable across the ISP. So each ISP sets its own pricing structure and rates. We can forward that information to you or a sample of that information if that's of interest.", "17058 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yes, that would be of interest to us. Could you get that sent to us?", "17059 ", "UNDERTAKING", "17060 MR. GAY: When you mentioned about our strategic plan, that was one of the things that we were very clear on going into this, is that we kept using the word \"competition\" because we want that to be in the marketplace. So it wasn't like government was going to go in and build you a, you know, a $20 a month or $100 month thing. It's, as Aimee said, the small folks who go in there, and you know, if Joe Blow's service isn't doing the job, then the next guy comes along and offers you something equally as good for a lesser price, well that's kind of the way things go.", "17061 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "17062 I'd like to now just move over to -- and here, I'm looking at your speaking notes that you've provided us with.", "17063 You say that:", "17064 \"The Government of Canada should create a permanent fund that can be accessed on an as needed basis by ISPs.\"", "17065 Can you explain what you mean by that or how that would work?", "17066 MR. GAY: Yes, so as I alluded to the gas tax fund, it was a deal that we made through our, it's called the Union of British Columbia Municipalities where the money has come from the feds to there. But it's a 10 year agreement.", "17067 So that's what we see, because as you know, by the time you plan these projects -- and our window of operating in the Kootenay's, we're in a very heavy snow belt most of our area is, is probably six months for sure, seven, but the winter months are very difficult. So kind of a planning year. You have the purchase the stuff, then the insulation. So doing that on an annual basis is very, very difficult. So that's what we just would like to see sort of the practicality put into these funding programs.", "17068 And Aimee maybe you can speak more about how long it's taken with the Connecting Canadians and so on?", "17069 MS. AMBROSONE: Yes, I think our thinking around having a fund that can be accessed on an as needed basis is, I think, right now there is a potential for a cycle to get created. You know, I think the federal (inaudible) service level used to be, you know, one and a half megs download speed and then there was funding that came out that was tied to that that was one time funding, and then, you know, a few years later, here comes the 5 megs speed and there's funding that's tied to that.", "17070 And it's great. It is absolutely great that there are dollars available for infrastructure upgrades for small ISPs, but I think it creates a bit of a perpetual cycle in that the (inaudible) changes. Here is what the new minimum download speed, which is a better speed, which is again, a good thing, so that (inaudible) changes.", "17071 The ISP always deals with the fact that they have a very small rural market from which to recover their capital costs. So they're getting some grant dollars to help with that from the feds, which is terrific, but they are kind of right in this perpetual cycle of oh, okay, maybe we need a capital upgrade, and then the speed is going to come out, the new speed requirement is going to come out, so we're going to tie our upgrade to that. And it just creates this cycle of apply, reapply, apply, reapply to meet new standards, which again, new standards are a good thing or higher speeds are a good thing for Canadians for sure.", "17072 I think if there was, you know, if there was a more permanent fund created on an as needed basis that was tied more specifically to granular thinking around which areas are underserved. It could help the ISPs plan better to make investments in their infrastructure for the long term that take them past some of those minimum speed thresholds.", "17073 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Now with this idea, would you say that this would be something that should be all the way across Canada? Or is this something that is more specific to your region?", "17074 MS. AMBROSONE: I can\u2019t speak to that. I speak from our region\u2019s context.", "17075 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Thank you for that.", "17076 MR. GAY: Yeah, it\u2019s safer.", "17077 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. So now to get back to the money, where would the money for this come from? How do you see the contributions happening for the fund like this?", "17078 MS. AMBROSONE: I think that there are -- there is currently funding available for federal infrastructure improvement programs and I think it\u2019s just redirecting existing funds.", "17079 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So ---", "17080 MR. GAY: Yeah, I agree. I think -- you know, if you give the residents the choice, what we\u2019ve seen in the past, and I\u2019ve been in government for over a decade now, is that government will come up with a program, and let\u2019s say it\u2019s, oh, I don\u2019t know, a park. And so we\u2019ve got a parks program. And we, as local government, we do our plans. And in our plan is sewer. So they\u2019ll say, well, here\u2019s parks money. Take it or leave it. Well, some politicians say, well, we\u2019re going to go chase that money and we\u2019ll build a park that we know in the long term we can\u2019t afford to maintain.", "17081 And we\u2019ve argued for years, give us the choice. Put the money in the pot and if we need a park, we build a park, if we need a trail, if we need sewer or if we need water or if we need broadband. And that\u2019s what I was very impressed, as a I mentioned, with that gas tax agreement where the list of activities that we could -- you know, and we set the priorities local. We could spend our money on, we will do it. So if our seniors need something, we can do it with that money. ", "17082 But as a region here, we\u2019ve chosen broadband as an important priority. And as I say, we are all prepared to do that.", "17083 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah.", "17084 MR. GAY: So just not putting a whole bunch of strings on some of these federal money and just say this is Infrastructure money Canada. You know what you need. You need a road, you needed broadband and that\u2019s good enough. So I agree with Aimee. Just let\u2019s redirect the funds. We don\u2019t need new taxes ---", "17085 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Where would you redirect the funds from?", "17086 MR. GAY: Well, that gas tax is a perfect example where all, you know, all Canadians when we gas up we pay a share of the tax and part of it comes back to each province and it\u2019s distributed.", "17087 The argument there that becomes between the province and the -- well, I guess we would see as the lower level of government, municipalities and that there\u2019s always that push. But I guess we won\u2019t have to fight that fight to see that. ", "17088 But, you know, it\u2019s kind of like healthcare but it -- broadband is so interesting because unlike natural resources where the federal government has told the province you\u2019re responsible for it, broadband seems to be we\u2019re all accountable for it. You know, the feds have pressures, the province does and so do the regions.", "17089 So when we get together as a collective with our MP and with our MLAs, we\u2019re on the same page. It\u2019s actually quite refreshing that way because the deed argument is not there. It\u2019s how we fund it. We kind of work together to try to figure that out, as well as our First Nations partners.", "17090 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. I have just a few more questions for you. In your speaking notes you also -- and I believe also in the short submission that you gave to us, you talked about the large incumbent telcos and the infrastructure. Do you have any asks of CRTC with respect to that?", "17091 MR. GAY: Yeah. And I don\u2019t know, Aimee and I were talking about it yesterday and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a word for it, but you know, this cherry picking or this coming into a community where we could make a business case out of 80 percent of the community, but the other 20 percent we don\u2019t care about. And their business case tends to be we need to pay this back or we need our ROI in two or three years.", "17092 Where, you know, we\u2019ve had discussions, more with Telus than with Shaw. And they say, well, if you could come up with some money -- and they\u2019re right. But it\u2019s frustrating where I\u2019ve got residents that, you know, can look across the street and I\u2019ve got five megabytes here and across the street the person\u2019s got nothing. It\u2019s that drastic. And the fibre cable\u2019s going right by these communities. And that\u2019s kind of what was our frustration with these folks.", "17093 And you know, we\u2019ve seen it in our province where it comes to public safety, they\u2019ve forced Telus into some deals, but it\u2019s always been short term. So provide this community broadband for the next two years at this rate, but then -- and then it skyrockets. Maybe I\u2019m thinking of someplace like Yap where, you know, it was a short-term solution but not long-term.", "17094 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. Do you have any specific recommendations for action for us or are you bringing this to our attention and asking us to contemplate it?", "17095 MR. GAY: Well, our recommendation would be -- and I don\u2019t know because I\u2019m not in it, is the open network. And we\u2019ve always had that concept. So if that cable is going through, and I know -- let\u2019s all pick on Telus -- Telus has paid for it. It\u2019s going by the community. But if they cannot make a business case, which is fine, that\u2019s how they do business, but there should be some rules to say at a reasonable cost, this small ISP should be able to hook onto that cable.", "17096 You know, certainly they\u2019re probably not using every fibre. We\u2019re talking about one fibre maybe out of a bundle of 48. And we, as a regional district, own the fibre. And we\u2019ve actually leased it back to Shaw. ", "17097 So we have this open concept but they certainly don\u2019t. And maybe I\u2019ll let Aimee speak more to it. But that\u2019s our frustration, especially as local politicians, when people know darn well that cable\u2019s going by their community and they\u2019re being told no, no, no, no, no.", "17098 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Thank you for those comments.", "17099 I just have a couple of more things that I would ask you to comment on, if you would like to. And one of them is on digital literacy. Do you have anything to say about that? How do you handle it in your area? Is that something we need to be concerned about here at CRTC?", "17100 MR. GAY: Exactly. You know, we -- and, Aimee, I\u2019ll let you speak to it. ", "17101 But when we do our presentations we show a graph of three things. One is kind of this graph that, you know, the first job is to get your community wired. And the second one is to get people educated. And the third one, you know, we have some of our communities are starting to look at that smart community concept, because it\u2019s a real economic driver for them as well as keeping people at home.", "17102 But, Aimee, I\u2019ll let you talk a little bit about the education piece and how we\u2019re approaching it.", "17103 Oh, did we lose her?", "17104 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: I think we lost her.", "17105 MR. GAY: Oh, okay.", "17106 MS. AMBROSONE: Sorry. It\u2019s Aimee here.", "17107 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Oh, here she is.", "17108 MR. GAY: Yeah. So Aimee, we\u2019re just talking about digital literacy.", "17109 MS. AMBROSONE: Yeah, I got you. Yeah.", "17110 I would just flag on the Commission\u2019s previous question.", "17111 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Sure.", "17112 MS. AMBROSONE: I would just flag that Columbia Basin Broadband made a submission as part of the review of the basic telecommunication services on July 13, 2015 with some very specific recommendations of what could be changed in the regulatory environment relevant to some of the questions that Rob is responding to and the access to telecom infrastructure. So that is a matter of the record.", "17113 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay. Thank you very much for bringing that to our attention.", "17114 MS. AMBROSONE: Okay. On the digital literacy issue, I actually -- you know, if you think about -- if we think about broadband from the economic development perspective, you know, there are programs in our area that teach seniors how to use computers or how to access the internet for the first time. And those are important things and they should be continued. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a role for the Commission there particularly.", "17115 I think the bigger issue is, it\u2019s one thing to build infrastructure and make these services available in a community. It\u2019s another thing for a small rural community to take advantage of that infrastructure and market their community to those economic development engines that could use the infrastructure to create more wealth and growth within the community.", "17116 So, for instance, we can build broadband infrastructure into small communities and give them access to better services. But if you think about a small rural community in Canada of 2,000 or 3,000 or 500 people, and maybe it\u2019s the nicest place to live in the world and maybe it\u2019s got some nice trails to hike on. It\u2019s got affordable housing so people will want to live and work there. You\u2019ve got a broadband infrastructure that can build and bring them better service. Someone is still going to need to work with the community, to help the community to develop their marketing strategy, to develop their recruiting strategy to get those people to live in their community, to figure out how it should maybe rezone land within the community for economic development purposes. Those kinds of things.", "17117 So having the infrastructure is one thing. Making all of the links to how the infrastructure could drive economic development is a whole other thing. It\u2019s an issue that we\u2019re just starting to wrestle with and just starting to help communities with, as Rob alluded to.", "17118 I think it\u2019s going to be complex. And all of the things that make driving rural service into rural areas challenging are going to apply to how do you use that service once it\u2019s there? I think it\u2019s a much broader issue than just build infrastructure and make service available. That isn\u2019t going to capture it.", "17119 And I don\u2019t have the answers for you. It\u2019s something we\u2019re just starting to wrestle with.", "17120 From my perspective, it would be a terrible thing if infrastructure was put in place and services were available and they weren\u2019t used to their utmost potential. And if you think about a small community and the work that would need to be done to take that infrastructure and do something with it, you\u2019ve got to think about where those resources going to come from, where is that capacity going to come from.", "17121 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, that's part ---", "17122 MS. AMBROSONE: Who\u2019s going to ---", "17123 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: That\u2019s part of what it is that we\u2019re looking at here.", "17124 MS. AMBROSONE: Yes.", "17125 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: We\u2019re referring it to -- to it essentially as adoption. And do you see any role for the CRTC with respect to adoption?", "17126 MS. AMBROSONE: M'hm, I think -- certainly I see a role for the federal government, I\u2019m not sure if -- its best home is within the CRTC. Maybe it rests more within a ministry focused on innovation, technology, economic development, that kind of a home.", "17127 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "17128 MS. AMBROSONE: I'm not sure there's a regulatory role there per se.", "17129 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you for that. This is my final question. I\u2019m wondering what -- what speed do you think is adequate for the digital economy?", "17130 MS. AMBROSONE: I'm going to let Rob answer that one.", "17131 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay.", "17132 MS. AMBROSONE: Oh, are you up?", "17133 MR. GAY: Oh sorry, I might get that.", "17134 MS. AMBROSONE: Yeah.", "17135 MR. GAY: Yeah. When we did the strategic planning we had our consultants look around the world, and I was surprised at some of the speeds in some of the developing countries. So I\u2019m going to say, you know, somewhere -- 50 would be sort of the minimum for these home-based businesses, people that want to, you know, work in the community and have their head office in a larger city. Five just doesn\u2019t cut it and 10 is actually too slow now, so that\u2019s kind of the area. And we -- we have a number of examples where people are living in these rural communities for lifestyle choices, and you know, connecting with -- with a larger company, you know, in the States or in the cities in Canada.", "17136 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, well thank you for that. Those are all my questions.", "17137 MR. GAY: I really appreciate the time, at least when we originally signed up we thought we\u2019d do our 10-minute presentation and go away, so your -- your exploratory questions have been just great in kind of ---", "17138 MS. AMBROSONE: Absolutely.", "17139 MR. GAY: --- let us expound on some of our things, so we certainly support your work. And I\u2019ve heard your folks speak at the Broadband Conference in British Columbia, and good luck with your deliberations. You\u2019ve got a real big job there.", "17140 MS. AMBROSONE: Absolutely.", "17141 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for having participated at this phase. As you know, there's further phases and you're most welcome to participate in those as well.", "17142 MR. GAY: Well we\u2019ll keep our eye on it. So thank you very much and thank you for your time today.", "17143 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. Those are -- those are all our questions, so thank you very much.", "17144 MR.

Please introduce yourself and your colleagues and you have 15 minutes for your presentation. ", "PRESENTATION", "17324 MR. MERH: Great, thank you. ", "17325 Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Commissioners. My name is Jay Mehr, president of Shaw Communications. ", "17326 I\u2019m joined by my colleagues. To my right, Peter Johnson, Executive Vice-President, Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer, Paul Cowling, Vice-President of Regulatory Affairs, and Sanae Takahsashi, Vice President, Product and Consumer Management. ", "17327 To my left, Katherine Emberly, Vice President of Operations, Sarah Miller-Wright, Vice President of Customer Care, and Zoran Stakic, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. ", "17328 A lot has changed at Shaw since this important proceeding began a year ago. On the eve of this hearing, we emerge from two landmark back-to-back transactions are a pure-play connectivity company. ", "17329 What hasn\u2019t changed is our focus on delivering exceptional customer experiences to customers within our redefined core markets. We will bring them what they need and what they want, competing for their loyalty each day. ", "17330 Canadians connect wherever and whenever, seamlessly and through multiple, always-on devices. Our business is connecting Canadians, and we are committed to maximizing these opportunities for our customers. That is what drove our recent transformation. ", "17331 Shaw\u2019s acquisition of WIND will create a distinct network of Wi-Fi, mobile and wireline networks that can deliver the best possible experience in the years to come. ", "17332 It is still early days, but we\u2019re looking at extraordinary opportunities to deliver choice and value to customers in our footprint, bringing Canada to the leading edge of the digital economy. ", "17333 Our unique Shaw Go Wi-Fi network, with over 75,000 access points, will play a fundamental role in our compelling, innovative alternative. ", "17334 As the Chair confirmed last week, broadband is vital to our economy, our society and our culture. The value of connecting has become the value of interacting with people, information and ideas. Connectivity enables us to gather, help each other, experiment, explore, create and contribute. ", "17335 As a connectivity company, our focus is on building and maintaining powerful and reliable networks and offering choice and innovative services at reasonable prices. This is our core mandate.", "17336 We also believe that Shaw ought to play a leadership role, alongside others, to ensure that all Canadians can join our digital societies -- society, regardless of whether Shaw connects them, including Canadians in remote locations, Aboriginal communities, Canadians with low incomes and Canadians with disabilities. ", "17337 Shaw welcomes the Commission\u2019s invitation to provide our input on a National Broadband Strategy that address these and other issues. ", "17338 At Shaw, our commitment to our customers is that they won\u2019t miss a thing. This simple but powerful statement expresses the outcome we strive for each day. It guides our priorities, the way we work together, our judgment and how we handle problems. Our first step is to think of our commitment to customers. ", "17339 Shaw proposes that a similar approach be taken to a National Broadband Strategy. We begin by defining our collective commitment to Canadians by expressing the outcomes we want. ", "17340 Shaw proposes that, in Canada: All rural and urban communities in all regions ought to have access to powerful and reliable broadband networks that can develop with the growing needs of Canadians, as well as an opportunity for choice. ", "17341 All Canadians ought to be empowered to use broadband, including those with low incomes, in remote areas, those that haven\u2019t discovered the opportunity of broadband and Canadians with disabilities. ", "17342 To realize the outcomes above, Canadians ought to have access to current data that will allow us to assess gaps in broadband availability, promote an understanding of broadband service, and overcome barriers to digital adoption. ", "17343 MR. JOHNSON: We have an opportunity to look at the specific gaps that are truly holding us back from achieving the outcomes that Jay described. The lack of transport infrastructure is hindering access and choice in remote areas. ", "17344 Other gaps underlie the testimonials we heard from Canadians with low incomes and Canadians with disabilities. These are complex challenges affecting multiple stakeholders. The best solutions will require collaboration by all levels of government, industry, First Peoples and the Commission.", "17345 The National Broadband Strategy must also recognize the importance of competition. ", "17346 In most of Canada we have vibrant markets with fierce inter-platform rivalry. Wholesale policies have also been designed to promote choice, and all its benefits, including lower prices, though in areas of the country with insufficient infrastructure wholesale policies have limited impact.", "17347 Competition requires us to invest and these investments facilitate significant growth. Canada\u2019s productivity and future depend on the tracks laid by the connectivity investment. Shaw has invested approximately $4 billion in our networks and customer experience since the last CRTC review of basic telecommunications. ", "17348 Competition demands that we be efficient. It rewards those who can best use investment dollars with rigour and creativity. ", "17349 Finally, but most importantly, competition forces us to provide each customer with the most valuable, reasonably priced service that best suits his or her needs. ", "17350 The policies from this proceeding should also reflect the importance of collaboration, competition and innovation to our digital future. Broadband should be defined as a basic telecommunications service but only to identify and remedy availability gaps. ", "17351 Canadians in all regions should be able to access online government, banking, educational, emergency and employment services. We support a minimum baseline for available download speeds of five megabits per second and a minimum baseline for available upload speeds of one megabit per second. Based on our experience and the Commission\u2019s data, each of these minimums is more than sufficient for the basic needs of residential and small business customers. ", "17352 These speeds should be available to all Canadians as a floor but consumers and the market should decide which configurations of download and upload are actually offered. ", "17353 We must also look forward to what is possible in the future, allowing consumers and the market to determine the path and pace. We encourage the CRTC to set an aspirational goal of 25 megabits per second for download and three megabits per second for upload. ", "17354 MS. TAKAHASHI: As Peter described, competition drives us to use creativity and innovation to bring customers what they need and what they want. Our Shaw Go WiFi network is a great example. Customers wanted access to our internet services beyond their homes and offices. Within a couple of years, we built Canada\u2019s largest, and North America\u2019s third largest, Wi-Fi network.", "17355 Shaw covers five provinces, a vast and variable geography which includes urban and remote areas. All of Shaw\u2019s customers want value, but specific broadband needs of our customers are as diverse as the geography. Many of them are with us because they love Shaw Go WiFi. Some need higher speeds, some don\u2019t. Each customer has an individual digital life, which is increasingly residing in the cloud and is reflected in an ever-changing connectivity profile.", "17356 At Shaw, we currently do not charge for usage-based billing and all of our internet services include free access to Shaw Go WiFi. These are critical differentiators for us in the market and we need to be able to continue to offer these and other innovations in the future. ", "17357 MR. STAKIC: The ambitions and innovations that Jay and Sanae mention all require significant, ongoing and smart network investments. ", "17358 Customers want more from the internet. We see this reflected in annual traffic growth of nearly 50 percent. We have to continually invest in all segments of our existing infrastructure to support these demands. We must also invest in evolving platforms like Wi-Fi and mobile to meet the customer\u2019s expectation of access everywhere.", "17359 We are seeing exciting developments across many platforms. In the near-term, DOCSIS 3.1 will enable multi-gigabit speeds over hybrid fibre coax. High-throughput satellites, next generation Wi-Fi and fixed wireless solutions are also emerging. Mobile technologies offer enormous potential, with LTE Advanced capable of download speeds in the hundreds of megabits per second. ", "17360 To provide Canadians with world-class connectivity, the industry will play our part by innovating and investing in these and other technologies, but we also have to invest efficiently, and as Katherine will explain, we cannot build in the areas unless -- in the remote areas unless it is economic to do so.", "17361 MS. EMBERLY: Even when local networks in remote areas successfully connect households, quality and reliability can be limited by a lack of access to transport. There is no point in building isolated pockets of local networks without connecting them to the world. Building new transport facilities to remote areas is usually uneconomic given the small population size and, in some cases, transportation or power issues. ", "17362 As the Let\u2019s Talk broadband results showed, Canadians in remote communities are limiting their broadband interactions with family, employment and educational resources. The impact is worsened by the fact that these Canadians rely more heavily on connectivity because of their remote locations.", "17363 Throughout the hearing Shaw heard many parties point to transport as the primary barrier to providing all regions with broadband. While each community has distinct challenges, transport often appears as the root cause.", "17364 If we are to succeed in connecting these Canadians, connecting Canadian communities must be a priority.", "17365 Enhanced access to transport would increase capacity and reliability and reduce operational expenses, increasing quality and decreasing prices, while reducing the risk of network disruption. ", "17366 It will encourage the competition that remote markets need. And it will also position our networks for the future so they can meet the traffic demands that Zoran described. ", "17367 ", "17368 All of this will bring households and businesses, as well as health, education and public safety organizations, into the digital world, driving the vitality of affected communities. ", "17369 Addressing the lack of reliable and affordable transport in the north and other remote areas will require huge capital investment and many years of work.", "17370 For all of these reasons, Shaw believes that transport infrastructure should be a focus for any national broadband strategy. ", "17371 We\u2019re pleased that the federal government committed funding to broadband, and we encourage them to consider transport as a priority. If the Commission implements its own funding mechanism, we believe the best investment would also be transport, based on the evidence of the need and the likelihood of its effectiveness. ", "17372 We have also heard throughout this proceeding of the struggles of Canadians who do not have the means to afford broadband and the impact this has had on their lives. This is a complex and serious issue. We see governments as being in the best position to design, fund and administer low-income assistance programs. ", "17373 We also believe that each industry player should develop initiatives as part of their community engagement or corporate social responsibility mandates, tailored to regional and market circumstances, and the strengths of the ISP. For Shaw\u2019s part, through Shaw Go WiFi, we have extended free access to Shaw internet at municipal locations in over 100 urban and rural communities. ", "17374 MR. COWLING: If the Commission establishes a funding mechanism to ensure the availability of broadband in remote areas Shaw would encourage the use of the following principles. ", "17375 We envision a competitive application or reverse-auction process.", "17376 Awards should be made to the lowest cost proposal that will bring one or more communities as close as possible to the aspirational target. We shouldn\u2019t build to the minimum baseline.", "17377 RFPs should vary depending on the region and the need.", "17378 All technological solutions should be eligible.", "17379 Funding should be directed to increasing capacity through transport.", "17380 Subsidized transport should be subject to mandated wholesale access, bringing Canadians that live in remote areas closer to the benefits of competition that most Canadians enjoy.", "17381 This approach is very different from the existing regime for voice. An obligation to serve and basic service objective would not be necessary as the conditions and quality should be specified in bidding and contractual arrangements. ", "17382 For the sake of consumers and future investments, any funding mechanism must be limited to what we can afford and should be capped. We should carefully review whether existing subsidies are necessary and whether -- and worthwhile before we layer on additional subsidies. Repurposing existing subsidies that are shown to be unnecessary is the most disciplined way to move forward.", "17383 MS. MILLER: This proceeding has enlightened all of us about the diverse and evolving broadband needs of Canadians. There are gaps to achieving the outcomes that Jay described, and this hearing has to look at what we are doing and assess whether it is enough or the right use of resources. ", "17384 At Shaw, we are committed to stepping up and excelling in our role as a customer-focused network builder and service provider. In order to give customers what they need and what they want, while ensuring their satisfaction, we need to be engaged in a constant conversation with them. We need to clearly explain to each customer what our services can do for them and what they cost. With our internet package comparison tool, customers describe their household needs and we recommend the plan that is right for them. We also have self-serve options for customers to monitor their ongoing usage of their internet service. ", "17385 As our dynamic industry shifts, we also need to continuously review our tools for Canadians with disabilities. In particular, we\u2019ve heard in this proceeding that mobile technologies require more attention. At WIND, we\u2019ve stepped up our efforts and recently launched a data only plan for Canadians who are deaf or hard of hearing. ", "17386 Canada\u2019s competitive markets and its regulatory environment have succeeded in empowering almost all Canadians with world-class connectivity. However, some Canadians are being left behind. We cannot let these Canadians miss a thing, and Shaw is committed to doing its part to ensure their full participation in our dynamic digital society. ", "17387 Thank you. We look forward to your questions.", "17388 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for that. Appearing late in an oral hearing is a tactical advantage. It\u2019s amazing sometimes people drop the ball, but you haven\u2019t. So thank you for adjusting your comments and your presentations accordingly. Thank you.", "17389 I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner Molnar.", "17390 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Good afternoon.", "17391 MR. MEHR: Good afternoon.", "17392 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I had a bit the same impression. It\u2019s very clear that when you come late on Day 12 you\u2019ve had an opportunity to hear a lot and respond and it\u2019s great. I\u2019ll try and keep my questions quite focused as a consequence, because you\u2019ve been able to address much in here.", "17393 MR. MEHR: Okay.", "17394 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I will say that you have said something I have not heard -- I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve heard it before, and that is where you say that Shaw ought to play a leadership role, because I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve heard of a lot of companies that have come before us or parties that have suggested they want to play a leadership role in getting to an end game here, so congratulations on that.", "17395 Let me go right to paragraph 10 of your remarks, and I\u2019m just going to focus my question based on your opening remarks here, so ---", "17396 MR. MEHR: Thank you.", "17397 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- just starting with the outcomes that you\u2019ve defined here. You\u2019ve packed a lot into your first bullet there of urban and rural communities, powerful, reliable, scalable and competitive. So I saw a lot of words in there, I just want to make sure in suggesting this is the outcome. When you say \u201cAll rural and urban communities\u201d, did you mean to say \u201cAll Canadians\u201d, or would you consider a rural municipality to be a community? ", "17398 MR. MEHR: Yeah, I mean I think the word choice was instructive of the different realities faced by urban and rural communities and the different economics in making this possible. I think it would be well worded if it simply said \u201cAll Canadians\u201d, I think that gets you there too.", "17399 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That\u2019s what you meant?", "17400 MR. MEHR: That\u2019s what we meant, indeed.", "17401 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. One of the words that wasn\u2019t in there -- and I think you folks were probably very careful in choosing your words -- but let me ask about unconstrained or abundant. You say powerful and reliable, but one of the things that\u2019s also been an issue here is the fact that people have constrained access to the internet. Would you say that part of the outcome, part of the objective should be access to abundant capacity? ", "17402 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17403 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I\u2019m not -- I'm not saying at no cost or anything like that.", "17404 MR. MEHR: No, understood.", "17405 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: But there's been many, many instances provided to us of folks who reach caps or ---", "17406 MR. MEHR: Sure.", "17407 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- get throttled, you know ---", "17408 MR. MEHR: Sure.", "17409 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- and it constrains their use.", "17410 MR. MEHR: Yeah, so you're using the word constrained around the quantity of data. Is that sort of how you're thinking about it?", "17411 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, they\u2019ve been constrained in their use in large part either by -- by small caps ---", "17412 MR. MEHR: Yes.", "17413 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- small capacity, you know, data caps. Or in some cases, by ITMP kind of -- of management of peak periods or other things that ---", "17414 MR. MEHR: Sure.", "17415 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- that really feather your use of the internet if you will.", "17416 MR. MEHR: Yeah. ", "17417 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I only ask because I believe you\u2019ve probably put a lot of thought into the words you\u2019ve chosen, so ---", "17418 MR. MEHR: Yeah, for sure. I mean the concept of data is an interesting one. When we talk about powerful networks and powerful customer experiences, we believe fundamentally it\u2019s networks that are used a lot and not constrained, using your words. We don\u2019t charge any customer for usage. And our fundamental business philosophy at Shaw is the more customers use the internet the more value they get from it, and it\u2019s therefore in our business interest. We kind of stand alone in that position. And to be clear, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll stand alone forever. ", "17419 If you think about connected cars and the internet of things, and potentially amounts of data five or 10 years from now that seem 100X what we\u2019re talking about today, which is already 10X of what we were talking about three years ago. There may be an opportunity where there will be an economic transaction for us around quantity of data as well, because we\u2019ve got to build that in the network. But in terms of -- we can only speak to the realities that we talk about today, and we have big data caps and our data caps are really just guidelines ---", "17420 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M'hm.", "17421 MR. MEHR: --- to help the people ---", "17422 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I understand ---", "17423 MR. MEHR: --- with the right packages.", "17424 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I had understood these principles were more the outcomes we want for Canadians ---", "17425 MR. MEHR: For Canadians.", "17426 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- not ---", "17427 MR. MEHR: Absolutely.", "17428 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- not just your customers, but Canadians. And as ---", "17429 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17430 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- as high level objectives.", "17431 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17432 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You would want them to be able to use -- to have access ---", "17433 MR. MEHR: Absolutely.", "17434 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- to you for the -- for all their ---", "17435 MR. MEHR: Absolutely. And behind the proposals -- if you look underneath it, the argument around transport is fundamentally what makes that possible. And usually, where those constraints come from is because of a lack of transport. So transport is actually the solution that makes possible those national powerful connections. And yeah, we absolutely believe that you can add the richness and depth of the customers\u2019 use to that definition of what Canadians should aspire to, and we remain open on what the economics of that are.", "17436 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yes.", "17437 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17438 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: For sure, yeah. And perhaps you could explain a little bit more your third bullet where you're talking about access to data.", "17439 MR. MEHR: Yeah, I mean we believe that there -- you heard from the folks from the Kootenay, some of the things that they're struggling with even in that part of the world to try and figure out where services are available and where services are not available. And we think there's a role perhaps -- probably for the CRTC to play a role in providing that data. And our view is that the majority of Canadians are well served, and that the majority of Canadians already enjoy this or most of what we aspire to, and that this hearing is most productive to focus on the gaps. And a big part of focusing on the gaps is to identify the gaps, which requires data.", "17440 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Very good. So that was -- that would be gaps. We\u2019ve heard about different mapping of where there's unserved areas within ---", "17441 MR. MEHR: Yes.", "17442 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- communities, organizations that appear to be served, but you always have those outliers.", "17443 MR. MEHR: Yeah, for sure.", "17444 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And as well -- yeah, discoverability of transport, we\u2019ve heard about that. So that\u2019s what you were talking about?", "17445 MR. MEHR: Yeah. As an example, we were sitting in the hearing listening to the communities in the Kootenays, we spent 10 or 15 minutes on our Blackberry trying to figure out where we served, at what speed, where things were, and we didn\u2019t even have great access to the data of what the various situations are. We had not bad access and I thank the team for their help, but it would be helpful if there was a place to go to be able to understand service levels in Canada.", "17446 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I see. Okay, thanks. Okay, and then you go on to say that this is about the gaps, and you're right, this hearing has been largely about the gaps. I appreciate however that you go on and talk about -- about the dynamic competitive industry that exists, and the investments and advancements because a broadband strategy would of -- would of course include all of that. Right now we\u2019re so focused on the gaps that sometimes it feels like we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re not, you know, keeping our heads in the broader picture, but for sure, you know, it all has to be considered in any strategy, but we\u2019ll go back to talking about the gaps.", "17447 MR. MEHR: Yeah, for sure. And if we could -- we believe that\u2019s really well said, because the challenges -- the goal is not to lower the bar in 2020 to where we can get the gaps to today.", "17448 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right.", "17449 MR. MEHR: The goal is to create an environment and a national broadband strategy in Canada where investment continues, where the gigabit internet is available for 95, 98, 99, ideally 100 percent Canadians. We\u2019ll see what's -- what's possible as you work through the exercise.", "17450 So I think it\u2019s important not to, in service of the gaps, limit what's possible in terms of the innovation and creativity of what will be possible in 2018 or 2020.", "17451 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M'hm, M'hm.", "17452 Without limiting what is possible, particularly where markets supported, and going back to our gaps, and you've identified them, you know, there's accessibility gaps ---", "17453 MR. MEHR: Yes.", "17454 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- some affordability -- you know, some -- for specific Canadians. You say that it requires:", "17455 \"...collaboration by all levels of government, industry, First Peoples and the Commission.\"", "17456 And we've certainly heard that before, but I personally would say I still don't have a clear view as to how that collaboration occurs.", "17457 Have you thought about that?", "17458 MR. MEHR: Yeah, for sure.", "17459 I think as you come out of a process like this, I think increasingly the industry is absolutely prepared to rally around something where we can all participate in. We were pleased with the actions of the new federal government to allocate money into this area and will be interested to see how that evolves.", "17460 For sure, there's a role for industry to play as well, and we've heard other members of industry suggest ideas on ways that we can work together to close the gaps, and we're certainly committed to working on that.", "17461 We've heard discussion of a advisory group that might be able to coordinate some industry efforts and work together. We'd be delighted to participate in that if the opportunity presents itself.", "17462 I think all of us can help, but the task is too big for any one of us to do on our own. So we'd like to find a way forward.", "17463 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Right, and what's clear is there is many different interests and stakeholders who have all been working towards this goal.", "17464 MR. MEHR: M'hm.", "17465 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: What isn't clear is that there is collaboration amongst them to focus the energy and resources, particularly, you know, in an area of priority. And I think that, to me, appears to be one of the questions.", "17466 Okay, so now how do you get all these stakeholders that have the interest together ---", "17467 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17468 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- so that it's a coordinated?", "17469 MR. MEHR: Right.", "17470 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So an advisory council is what you would say, something like that?", "17471 MR. MEHR: Yeah, and we're happy to participate in any format that is deemed possible. I mean, we like clear direction; right. And so if the direction is access, if the direction is to say let's get Canadians access to the aspirational goal of 25 megs down and 3 megs up, and let's start by addressing those communities and those Canadians who don't have access to at least 5, because you've got to start somewhere, there's all kinds of ways we can collectively solve that.", "17472 I mean, Paul made some suggestions about a process in terms of getting transport built on a competitive process, and our view is once transport is built that the last mile is quite -- it's relatively easy. I don't mean to overstate the easiness of it, but I think there will be a competitive process there.", "17473 And to the extent that transport has built the communities in Western Canada that we don't serve, we would be quite open to performing a last mile function in a number of communities and participating on that basis.", "17474 There's also opportunities for those of us who don't have infrastructure to build infrastructure into certain parts of the country. We don't have a great solution of how to coordinate each of us to do so, but I think we're open to a model that would allow us to do so.", "17475 We like the opportunity. We think in a rich country like Canada, Canadians should have access. We like that the Commission has stepped forward with the potential of a national broadband strategy and we certainly are excited to work with others to step into whatever role we can play.", "17476 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, and just to confirm what you just said.", "17477 So your notion of an aspirational goal is that would be what would -- the next sort of wave of investment would be towards achieving 25/3 for those unserved or underserved today ---", "17478 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17479 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- and begin with those that are at or less than 5?", "17480 MR. MEHR: Yes.", "17481 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That's kind of the approach?", "17482 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17483 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So the 5 is a basic service or a 25/3 becomes the basic service?", "17484 MR. MEHR: Yeah, I think ---", "17485 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I'm a bit confused about those two numbers here.", "17486 MR. MEHR: Yeah, for sure.", "17487 Happy to share our point of view. The -- because we have spent some time trying to figure out how to make this work. And I get lost in some of the naming and the word of basic and what it means in the various regulatory languages. So if we just sort of focus on the what and then we can figure out the naming afterwards.", "17488 If we think of having access to 5 meg in the download and 1 meg in the upload, is really a definition of do you have access to a minimum level service; and therefore, if you don't, there's an opportunity to intervene in some way, whether it's through federal funding, whether it's through some kind of model that the CRTC comes up with, we think that should be the bar.", "17489 For sure, if you build anything we should be building it to at least 25/3. If there's money from somewhere that isn't 100 percent private investment, there's no advantage at this point to building the 5 and 1.", "17490 And as an example, we built a tremendous amount of fibre in the Kootenay's -- to the previous presentation -- and everywhere we built, we built to 60 and 6; 60 in the downstream and 6 in the upstream, including some very small communities.", "17491 The challenge is, you could argue, that we've even exacerbated the have's and have not's in the region by making that investment, but anytime you build we think you should be building at least to that aspirational target.", "17492 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You make a point of your investment in wind and the opportunities with LTE advanced capable of download speeds in the hundreds of megabytes. How do you see mobile LTE fitting into closing the gaps, if at all?", "17493 MR. MEHR: Yeah, we absolutely see mobile technologies as playing an important role.", "17494 We understand the view is that mobile technologies, and LTE in particular, is able to produce quite strong speeds but isn't able to produce the amount of volume that most consumers want.", "17495 To be fair, the amount of volume that lots of consumers want can be filled by an LTE network, and we were struck by a U.S. Census survey last week that said 1 in 5 Americans had gone to mobile only in terms of their data service. And so we think there's a portion of the market that can be served that.", "17496 As you think about 5G, 5G really's ultimate (inaudible) is fibre-like speeds, and maybe in the wireless world that's 20/20 in terms of handsets, but certainly AT&T and Verizon are increasingly using 5G technology perhaps as soon as next year for their last mile in lieu of fibre to the home.", "17497 So we think any outcomes that we take as part of our national broadband strategy should enable whatever the best technology is to enable our goals. And in some instances, it'll be wireless, either LTE or 5G, in some instances, it may well be satellite, in some instances it may be DOCSIS 3.1.", "17498 We don't think the strategy should pick a platform, we think it should pick an outcome.", "17499 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And you are consistent with everyone in saying this should not be about choosing a technology, but I just personally do have an interest in whether or not where the gaps exist, not within major urban markets, but where the gaps exist today, whether or not mobile technology could be one of those viable alternatives. And if you're saying it is, you're the first to say it is.", "17500 MR. MEHR: Yeah, here -- I mean, this is the challenge we struggle in our business every day is how much of you hear, and read, and see at conferences is noise and how much is real.", "17501 If -- are we prepared to say that 5G is a meaningful last mile substitution for the future? I don't think I'm prepared to say that. Am I prepared to say that it's not? You know, when you look at the way AT&T and Verizon are talking about making that investment as soon as next year, I'm certainly not prepared to bet against it.", "17502 The -- it's a challenge. In any scenario, it doesn't matter. Wireless is only powerful if it's powerfully wired behind it. So in any event, even if 5G is a solution to -- it may well be a solution to those folks, Mr. Gay and the Kootenay's presentation, talked about those communities just outside of Cranbrook. It may well be the solution for those communities, but it still needs to be connected to fibre in Cranbrook in order to get somewhere, so we still think the primary solution is transport and the fibre that will connect the wired, whether it\u2019s 4G or 5G.", "17503 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M\u2019hm. Okay.", "17504 You have made your point now three or four times that the focus should be on transport. ", "17505 So we have heard about the challenges in remote communities and, you know, the far north and some others, so I understand that. What was a bit confusing or surprising to me is the fact that you felt it was so very simple to manage the last mile. ", "17506 Certainly the other -- some of the groups that we heard from yesterday there was a woman in Manitoba who farmed in Manitoba, the SILEC\u2019s came talking about within their area and, you know, outside of the donut it becomes pretty expensive, pretty costly to serve. We had the wireless service providers here today all focused on the last mile and all indicating challenges.", "17507 So why is it you feel it\u2019s so easy to serve and that it doesn\u2019t require the same amount of focus as transport? ", "17508 MR. MEHR: I think in the long run it won\u2019t require the same amount of macro-economic dollars. That doesn\u2019t mean the economics are any easier. ", "17509 And so when you think about the last mile -- look, if you\u2019re in an apartment building, or an MDU, or a single family subdivision which is a 50-foot frontage and there\u2019s another home beside you, serving those communities are not hard. We all do it. There\u2019s a cost to doing it but the return on that investment is easily paid for through your triple-play $100 RPU. It\u2019s economics that can make sense. ", "17510 Where you have the struggle in the last mile is as you get to wherever your network ends. And I think you\u2019ve heard that from a number of people. But typically your network doesn\u2019t end that you have house 42 on a street and house 44 right beside it isn\u2019t served, typically that last mile is four or five residents over the next three or four miles, often on acreage or multi-acreage properties, and so that\u2019s what changes those economics. ", "17511 We focused our comments much more on the north and places where there just aren\u2019t easy solutions and we think probably government money has to be part of the solution.", "17512 On some of those solutions there ought to be ways to adjust those economics enough that somebody can figure out how to build that plant.", "17513 So we don\u2019t minimize that the end of it -- we don\u2019t minimize that the end of that is not currently being done. ", "17514 And, you know, it\u2019s interesting -- not the last mile, but if you do the 10-mile radius of served Canadians, you know, where networks end in the next 10 miles, I bet that\u2019s a good portion of unserved Canadians.", "17515 So we are open that we maybe should spend a little bit more time figuring out solutions to those Canadians.", "17516 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, if it could have been done I expect you and the other folks would have done it. Your networks wouldn\u2019t have ended if there was a business case to serve the next one.", "17517 MR. MEHR: For sure.", "17518 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And, you know, then we had the other alternate technologies like the wireless and satellite step in, but they certainly have indicated issues with capacity, with cost, oversubscription, you know, many issues.", "17519 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17520 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And so ---", "17521 MR. MEHR: Yeah, and ---", "17522 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And maybe I need to step back. One of the questions I didn\u2019t ask you and I should have, when you\u2019re talking about your strategy and you\u2019re talking to first focus on transport, what kind of timelines are you speaking of in achieving the outcomes you\u2019ve put forward? Like when is it you think that there will be solutions for last mile?", "17523 MR. MEHR: Yeah, so -- I mean, we\u2019ll take both of those questions.", "17524 In terms of transport, you know, civil construction long-distance build is likely an 18-month horizon from when the money is available. ", "17525 We struggle -- so here we\u2019re talking about serving communities, so it\u2019s a line where you go to somewhere and then there\u2019s people there in a relatively dense way. It doesn\u2019t have to be a lot of people but there\u2019s a community there, right. And so -- I mean, it\u2019s pure economics. ", "17526 A community like Flin Flon we serve on a video only basis. We\u2019ve looked at building fibre to Flin Flon. It\u2019s $20 million to build fibre to Flin Flon, and we don\u2019t really pass all that much on the way. So there\u2019s no economic case -- we have about 1,200 video customers in Flin Flon. There\u2019s no economic case for us to get a return from that $20 million. So the only way to offer service in Flin Flon is if somebody connects Flin Flon.", "17527 In terms of last mile technologies, you\u2019re correct ---", "17528 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: If I could just ---", "17529 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17530 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- before you go on.", "17531 MR. MEHR: Please.", "17532 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I\u2019ve had the opportunity to speak with the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Flin Flon and ---", "17533 MR. MEHR: Oh, great.", "17534 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- she would be really, really happy if you could figure out how to get fibre there.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "17535 MR. MEHR: Yes.", "17536 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And just because I drove there I\u2019d be really happy if WIND connected it.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "17537 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17538 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Because it\u2019s a really dark hole with no cell service.", "17539 MR. MEHR: Well, there\u2019s that too. There is that too, yeah.", "17540 No, it is a -- and that is a challenge, and I -- and, I mean, Flin Flon isn\u2019t the north but I suspect it\u2019s an even bigger challenge in the north where you have these long distances, that there isn\u2019t a technology besides fibre.", "17541 In terms of the last mile, you\u2019re correct, every year in our budget meeting -- and I\u2019ve been through 20 of them now -- every year in our budget meeting we look through plant expansions and where we can build plant and get a return on capital to build plant, and we knew -- we do build plant extensions every year where we\u2019re getting to that next house and the house beyond it. The economics get tougher and tougher and so we don\u2019t have a great solution of how you would change that spreadsheet.", "17542 For sure, the quantum to change that spreadsheet is way easier, you know, if there was some kind of fund or money available, as Paul describes. That\u2019s way easier than connecting Flin Flon because it\u2019s not -- you know, $20 million would get you thousands, and thousands, and thousands of homes on plant extensions. So the economics aren\u2019t as big. It\u2019s equally difficult in that it requires -- it doesn\u2019t make sense in a pure economic form.", "17543 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Just following your presentation, you speak in paragraph 30 about what you consider to be the role of the industry as it regards affordability. So noting first off that government is in the best position to design, fund and administer low income assistance programs, you go on to say that you think every industry player should develop initiatives.", "17544 Could you explain to me what your thinking was there, that every industry player should design initiatives to address issues of affordability?", "17545 MR. MEHR: Yeah, thank you.", "17546 We -- the Canadian system has provided us all with great places to live and great places to raise families and to build businesses, and as part of that we all have a responsibility to do our part. ", "17547 And, you know, we\u2019ve seen various proposals around connecting Canadians that have low incomes. Clearly a gap exists, just as it exists for other household needs like groceries and transit passes. We\u2019d love there to be an industry initiative to address at least basic levels of connectivity so that Canadians could maybe not stream Show Me at 8:00 o\u2019clock at night but could access job postings, and kids homework assignments, and we think that\u2019s within -- we think it\u2019s quite realistic for industry to do that. ", "17548 If a clear consensus comes out of this hearing on something to do we\u2019d be happy to participate and if not we certainly will step up and do something on our own.", "17549 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Well, thank you for all initiatives you take on this matter.", "17550 My question really is if industry does not step up -- I mean, you bring up here the issues of community engagement or corporate social responsibility. I think it was Bell who sat there and said \u201cWell our issue is mental health\u201d.", "17551 MR. MEHR: M\u2019hm.", "17552 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So from a corporate responsibility position it -- and I\u2019m pleased that you would say your issue is engaging, you know, increasing adoption and addressing issues of affordability within your -- within the Internet broadband file, but how would we ever coordinate or require other industry players to do the same?", "17553 MR. MEHR: Yeah. I -- first of all, we applaud Bell\u2019s work on mental health. We think they have actually got scale and they\u2019re able to do something that has consequence.", "17554 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And I\u2019m not ---", "17555 MR. MEHR: Understood.", "17556 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah.", "17557 MR. MEHR: Yeah. Totally understood.", "17558 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: It was just the position stated.", "17559 MR. MEHR: Yeah, no. Totally understood.", "17560 It\u2019s what we can do too and we do a lot of things in terms of kids in our communities and our various initiatives as well. There is room for all of us to play a role here. There has been talk in this hearing about an advisory council and potentially getting some CEOs involved in it. We think it\u2019s a terrific challenge to ask that organization how we can work together.", "17561 And we don\u2019t mind if we all work independently. Rogers made a proposal on social housing I think. If that\u2019s the model that we all want to do, then let\u2019s get behind something like that. If there\u2019s a better way to do it, we\u2019re open to having that conversation as well.", "17562 For sure there\u2019s an opportunity for industry to participate and make a difference. And it\u2019s only a small portion of the gap that we\u2019re talking about is the National Broadband Strategy. So there must also be a role for the federal government and others in filling some of the other gaps.", "17563 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, for sure.", "17564 Another are I guess I talked to a couple companies about filling for industry was the issue of literacy as leaders, just given that many of the issues surrounding literacy are really issues you should care about with your customers. You know, not only would it increase adoption, but ensuring they\u2019re safe, you know, and private and all of that.", "17565 So would you see that to be another issue that would be well led by industry?", "17566 MR. MEHR: Yeah, we think it\u2019s an important topic. Maybe I\u2019ll have Katherine talk a little bit about her thoughts on this.", "17567 MS. EMBERLY: Sure. Thanks, Jay.", "17568 You know, at the very core, it\u2019s in our best interests that more Canadians use and actually love the Internet. And for many years we\u2019ve supported a number of groups in the community such as the Centre for Child Protection MediaSmarts. And we\u2019ve recently worked with Calgary Police Service on the Shaw Centre for digital wellness and leadership. And so we\u2019re tremendously proud of all of these.", "17569 We ourselves aren\u2019t experts in digital literacy. But we\u2019re certainly happy to support and partner with the experts.", "17570 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Thank you.", "17571 So the next area that you addressed in your opening remarks were principles for broadband availability funding. And you begin the section saying if the Commission establishes a funding mechanism.", "17572 You have not taken a position on should the Commission establish a funding mechanism. It\u2019s quite a significant hole, if you will.", "17573 MR. MEHR: Sure.", "17574 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: It\u2019s missing a position here.", "17575 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17576 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Should we or shouldn\u2019t we? Is it necessary? Is it not? Is it later?", "17577 MR. MEHR: For sure. We do have some comments on the record from our submission. I\u2019ll let Paul talk to them. You know, obviously, as the focus of the hearing changed so did our remarks a little bit. But perhaps we can talk about ---", "17578 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go back. I have your --", "17579 MR. MEHR: Yeah.", "17580 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- submission here. But --", "17581 MR. MEHR: Yes.", "17582 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: -- things have evolved so.", "17583 MR. MEHR: Yeah, for sure. No, that makes a lot of sense. Paul, do you want to ---", "17584 MR. COWLING: I think we still see a primary role for government in terms of closing the availability gaps that have been identified. And there is now an announcement from the federal government of a significant amount of funding.", "17585 So when we looked at the opportunities from this hearing to close those gaps and the scope of the issue around transport, we see the potential for a combination of the federal funding and some supplemental compliment to that through an industry funded CRTC overseen subsidy mechanism.", "17586 So I think the short answer to your question is we would support a CRTC initiative to expand the scope of funding to address the transport issue.", "17587 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. I\u2019m a bit surprised by that, but fair enough.", "17588 Would you say that it should be done in coordination with the 500 million federal announcement or should that be set and established in any sort of required funding through a CRTC mechanism follow?", "17589 MR. COWLING: I think it\u2019d be on the coordination side because we\u2019d want to maximize these dollars. And I think to the data point, the first step would really to be to establish the priorities in the country looking at the country from a holistic connectivity perspective. Where are the biggest gaps and how can we most efficiently address those gaps?", "17590 So that is a conversation, if you will, with ISED and making sure that their funding is not contradictory or not overlapping with any funding that the CRTC would undertake and that the dollars are being maximized.", "17591 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And in what timeframe?", "17592 MR. COWLING: Well, you\u2019d build back I think from, you know, Jay\u2019s timeframe in terms of the deployment of the network. And then you\u2019d need to take appropriate time to actually do that assessment through a gathering of that data. That would take some time. I would -- sorry.", "17593 MR. MEHR: Yeah, no, for sure. For sure. And I think the first thing is this -- like anything is the start; right? It\u2019s not about serving 100 percent of Canadians at the aspirational target immediately, you know, instructive to listen to the amount of money that the terrific group from the Kootenays has put into creating transport in that part. I mean, it\u2019s a big region, but it\u2019s a small part of Canada and sort of the millions and millions of dollars that have gone into it. There\u2019s lots of complexity, as you heard from their description of the work to be done.", "17594 And it\u2019s our view that there\u2019s potentially a movement, and I know it\u2019s controversial, around subsidies that are currently on voice as a lifeline service and being able to use that to partially fund some opportunities on the broadband side. Clearly, this is a multi-year approach and that the important part and the government has started by allocating funding on this as well. The important part is that we all get started.", "17595 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. You mentioned reallocating subsidies from voice. And I actually wasn\u2019t going to even bother asking you because it\u2019s very clear there\u2019s hard lines drawn between those who pay and those who receive. And, you know, the positions are quite clear.", "17596 So if it was determined that the money could be reallocated, would you see that happening in a transitional measure?", "17597 MR. MEHR: Let me start and then I\u2019ll pass to Paul. It\u2019s not clear to me, and maybe it\u2019s order of magnitudes. It\u2019s not clear to me that we either pay or receive in a huge magnitude one that would affect our position on this fund. But you can talk about mechanics of it.", "17598 MR. COWLING: We see a transition. I think for us it\u2019s a question of investment. And there\u2019s certainly -- there\u2019s some other parties have called into question whether the costs should be reviewed. Based on our review, in a lot of these exchanges there are lower cost alternatives, whether it be voice or wireless, and there\u2019s also fibre builds.", "17599 So I think the question is really just whether these investment dollars still make sense. And in our view that there is a case that they don\u2019t. And so that is an opportunity to redeploy that funding. But that review would need to take place. Again, we\u2019ve looked at a lot of these exchanges and we see lower cost alternatives. So we would encourage the CRTC to look at that and then repurpose accordingly.", "17600 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So did you hear MTS? You had an opportunity to hear them and they said that their amount of funding -- I might get the number wrong, but I think they said it was something like 35 percent, their amount of funding declined as customers chose alternatives, whether that be wireless or a VoIP solution.", "17601 Do you consider that would be a reasonable way? Because if the solutions are there and the customers are willing to take those solutions, the funding naturally -- it would -- you know, in the past the amount of subsidy declined in totality, but that could be redirected in that way? Or are you seeing something a bit more abrupt?", "17602 MR. COWLING: No, I think that sounds like a reasonable approach. ", "17603 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: That\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, okay. Thank you. I just have a couple more questions and then I will pass it to my colleagues here. ", "17604 You have been listening and you\u2019ve answered so many of the questions, you know, we have -- we\u2019ve asked not just about filling the gaps, but empowering the customer base, your full customer base with greater knowledge and tools and so on and you\u2019ve identified what tools your provide to your customers. ", "17605 Would you be able to undertake to provide us with information regarding the top three complaints that you receive from your customers? ", "17606 MS. MILLER-WRIGHT: Yes, we can take that undertaking. ", "17607 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. And do you have contracts? ", "17608 MS. MILLER-WRIGHT: We do. We have service agreements. ", "17609 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Would you be able to provide us a copy? ", "17610 MS. MILLER-WRIGHT: Yes, we can. ", "17611 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. ", "17612 MR. MEHR: Just for a complete answer on that question. We don\u2019t have service agreements on Internet alone. We do have service agreements on bundled packages, which are largely in place in order to give customer free video hardware, but we\u2019re happy to provide the information on all of those. ", "17613 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay, thank you. ", "17614 You have also identified that work you\u2019re doing, that Wind is doing, for the deaf and hard-of-hearing in your new data-only plan. ", "17615 If you had an opportunity to hear some of the different customers who came forward with ability issues, there was for example Mr. John Rae and he was talking about his experience and frustration when he\u2019s dealing with some of the frontline staff. ", "17616 He\u2019s not in your market, but can you tell me what sort of training or support you provide to your frontline staff to dealing with people with disability issues? ", "17617 MS. MILLER-WRIGHT: Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. ", "17618 We train all of our customer-facing staff on the various options that we have for our customers with disabilities. So for things such as offering bills in brail or different equipment options, our agents do learn about that. ", "17619 The volume that they might receive is quite low so we also maintain a very robust internal knowledge base that all of our agents have access to that contains all the information that they might need. ", "17620 So if they do get an inquiry from a customer who has a disability, then they can easily access that information. ", "17621 We also offer options for some of our customers who might be challenged in visiting say a retail location or calling us through our online chat and e-care options as well where they can reach customer-facing representative who is equally as capable and knowledgeable as one of our representatives on the phone or in one of our retail locations. ", "17622 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thank you. I\u2019m going to pass you on to my colleagues. ", "17623 THE CHAIRMAN: Before I pass it on to the Vice-Chair, just I misunderstood the point about contracts existing or not. So if it\u2019s standalone Internet arrangement, what do you do, what is the -- how -- what are the -- what\u2019s the contractual -- it may not be a contract in a classic sense, but what\u2019s the contractual relationship? ", "17624 MR. MEHR: The -- any -- there are terms and conditions, which we\u2019ll file as part of the undertaking. ", "17625 THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. ", "17626 MR. MEHR: We hear a point of view that that is a contract, but a customer can cancel at any time on their Internet service. ", "17627 THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. ", "17628 MR. MEHR: It\u2019s only if you bundle the services do you take a time commitment in order to get free equipment. ", "17629 THE CHAIRMAN: Right, okay. And just going back to first-year law as to what a contract is or isn\u2019t, but there is a relationship there that is set by certain terms and conditions? ", "17630 MR. MEHR: For sure. And we\u2019ll submit the terms and conditions ---", "17631 THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. ", "17632 MR. MEHR: --- because we would also argue they\u2019re a contract. ", "17633 THE CHAIRMAN: Yeah, well my first-year law professor would have -- contract law professor would have argued that as well, so thank you. ", "17634 Vice-Chair Menzies. ", "17635 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Hi, thanks. ", "17636 I just want to, if you could, to expand a little with -- just help us -- me, at least, understand how you would see, and this is just an extension of the question Commissioner Molner asked, a funding for transport working? ", "17637 So I\u2019m guessing because you were talking about it that Flin Flon doesn\u2019t have fibre, for instance. So how would -- basically how would it work? Would you start with the reverse auction or bidding or how do you see it working? ", "17638 Have you unpacked it that far? It\u2019s okay if you haven\u2019t, but I\u2019d like some recommendations on what you think is the most -- have been the most effective tools you\u2019ve seen. ", "17639 MR. COWLING: Yeah, I\u2019ll unpack it a bit. ", "17640 So there would be an RFP design process. And I think we heard from a number of community groups in interviews from the north along similar lines, they would suggest that affected communities, municipal governments, maybe a community aggregator who might be affected would actually be participating in the design of the RFP. With any RFP, you kind of go out and you test the market. So what\u2019s the demand and what\u2019s the prospective supply. ", "17641 Then you put -- you know, and you could do things -- we envision a public-private partnership model so that you would have the private company come forward and build the infrastructure and a certain percentage of it would be in their control and they would therefore have an incentive to build out the local access network. ", "17642 The other percentage would be wholesale access and open and the terms and conditions of that access would be part of the bid. So once you sort of nailed down the RFP, then you\u2019d have an open bid. ", "17643 Whether it\u2019s a reverse auction, i.e. lowest cost no matter what, or a more balanced assessment of various metrics, I don\u2019t think we have a strong view either way on those two choices, but you would -- you\u2019d want to ensure that you get the maximum payoff for the dollars in terms of hitting the aspirational speeds, hitting as many communities or as many Canadians as possible and doing so with the lowest cost subsidy. ", "17644 So in some scenarios, you\u2019d have 25 percent subsidy because that\u2019s what the competitive bidding process yielded. In some cases, you might have an 80 percent subsidy where there\u2019s less interest and you need to create more of an incentive to invest. So those are ---", "17645 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s helpful, thank you. The other question, some have suggested and used examples elsewhere of sort of tiered targets and, I mean, these numbers are just for purpose of example, but do you think it would be appropriate coming out of this if we did set targets for -- I give you sort of an example, if we said 100 percent at 5 and 1 in all satellite served communities, I don\u2019t know, 100 percent at 10 and 1 or something in all terrestrial communities by X date, 80 percent at 25 and 70 percent at 50 or something along that line. ", "17646 I mean, I\u2019m hesitant to throw things out with -- because I\u2019m just making it up right now, more or less. Would it be appropriate to do that sort of thing and maybe have targets for, you know, fewer satellite served, if you know what I mean, things along those lines because of the nature of Canada and the extreme differences in some of these areas? ", "17647 MR. MEHR: Yeah, for sure. Yeah, we think that\u2019s a reasonable approach and we also like some thought process of increasing service over time because clearly the one thing we know for sure is customers in 2020, even those that are well served in 2016, won\u2019t be happy with the Internet they\u2019re getting in 2016 or the broadband that they\u2019re getting in 2016. So we think that\u2019s helpful. ", "17648 Our one caution would as you cross that line from served to under -- from underserved to served, it is quite a step change in service. 98 percent of customers that are served by Shaw or that we can serve, that past households have access to 60 megahertz down and 6 megahertz up, so that\u2019s almost 10 million Canadians have access to that from Shaw. ", "17649 So the challenge is when you solve transport, when you solve the last mile, you really should be aspiring for bigger numbers. We aspire to a lot more than 60 for those 10 million Canadians that have access to our service. ", "17650 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I just didn\u2019t want to get anybody too excited. ", "17651 MR. MEHR: Yeah exactly. So we like the step. I think when you actually are in the wireline area and you build the fibre and you go the last mile in place, you know, it\u2019s even faster speeds, it quickly becomes possible. ", "17652 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you. Those are all my questions. ", "17653 THE CHAIRMAN: Checking with colleagues? No. So just a couple of questions for me, I asked this of others, and I wasn't sure whether -- well, I'll give you an opportunity to answer.", "17654 Do you use the Alberta SuperNet as -- for transport facilities?", "17655 MR. MEHR: Yes, we think Alberta SuperNet's a terrific model and has generated lots of different ISPs in competition. We use the SuperNet as backbone in three communities, Stettler, Barrhead and Drayton Valley -- thank you. So we use it in three communities in Alberta.", "17656 THE CHAIRPERSON: We've also heard and had some discussion about the use of power companies' fibre. Are -- have you done that anywhere on your territory?", "17657 MR. STAKIC: We did have conversations in that space and we absolutely welcome the ideas of shared infrastructure.", "17658 THE CHAIRPERSON: And there's -- well, there's maybe a negotiation required, but there's no barrier to -- for that being used; is there?", "17659 MR. STAKIC: We don't see any barriers at this point.", "17660 THE CHAIRPERSON: And should we go down the road of subsidizing transport, what happens to wholesale rates? Does the Commission oversee those?", "17661 MR. MEHR: Yeah, it's a great question. We -- it's -- we're pleased that you raised wholesale rates because we actually think the wholesale rate model is very successful and actually addresses affordability in competition very effectively in Canada where there is infrastructure today. And of course, the gap with the wholesale model is it doesn't help anywhere there's nothing to wholesale.", "17662 For sure, we believe that if transport is funded by something else, otherwise -- other than private investment, that transport should be made open. And whether that's through a wholesale structure or whether through the terms of the RFP itself, we think however that gets built, everybody should have access to that transporting. And using that model, you also should get vigorous competition in the markets after those markets are connected.", "17663 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, and so over time, the wholesale regulation may not be required, but once you have a few public dollars in there of same nature ---", "17664 MR. MEHR: Yeah, for sure.", "17665 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- you need that?", "17666 MR. MEHR: I think that makes sense.", "17667 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, understood.", "17668 I think, echoing my comments at the beginning, the brevity of your appearance is more a testimony of your preparation than the lack of interest on the part of the Commission with your position. So thank you. I think those are all our questions. I thank you very much.", "17669 MR.

Before we begin I would like to announce that -- like I announced yesterday, Concordia University Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, ADISQ, On Screen Manitoba and the Canadian Media Producers Association advised us that they will not be appearing today.", "17675 We will now start with the presentation of MRC de T\u00e9miscamingue, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet vous pr\u00e9senter et pr\u00e9sentez vos coll\u00e8gues -- votre coll\u00e8gue, et vous avez 10 minutes pour votre pr\u00e9sentation.", "PRESENTATION", "17874 THE SECRETARY: I will now invite Bragg Communications to come to the presentation table.", "17875 Please introduce yourself and your colleagues when you're ready, and you have 15 minutes for your presentation.", "17876 MS. MacDONALD: Good morning, Chairman, Commissioners, Commission staff.", "17877 My name is Natalie MacDonald. I'm VP, Regulatory for Eastlink.", "17878 To my right is Lee Bragg, our CEO; and to my left is Marielle Wilson, our Regulatory Analyst.", "17879 And Lee?", "17880 MR. BRAGG: Thank you.", "PRESENTATION", "17881 MR. BRAGG: We appreciate the opportunity to be here today and to share with you our views on these important issues.", "17882 At the outset, we wish to address the panel's remarks that the Chairman made on April 17", "th", ". Our written submission describes at length Eastlink's experience as a rural-focused service provider and the efforts we have made to bring state of the art services to some of the smallest communities in the country. We invest 100 percent of our profits back into our business, which has allowed us to expand services to new areas and upgrade services in other areas.", "17883 As a family-owned business from rural Nova Scotia, we take pride in ensuring that small rural communities can enjoy the advantages of the same, if not higher, quality services than some of the larger urban centers in Canada. We are more than familiar with the challenges of making the business case in smaller communities and we have taken them on time-over-time.", "17884 But we also recognize that our regulator and governments have enabled or contributed to our success at certain key times. As a regulator, the Commission's role in encouraging facilities-based competition and setting the stage so we could do so under reasonable terms and conditions was critical.", "17885 In 1999, we became the first cable company in Canada to provide competitive telephone service over our cable network under those policies, and we rely on such policies today for our wireless business, as we continue to invest into new communities.", "17886 In our submission, we also described the value that governments can play through cooperative arrangements and funding support towards infrastructure builds, which in turn improves services for Canadians and bolsters the economy.", "17887 In Eastlink's view, this proceeding was primarily about how to fill the broadband gaps for Canadians consistent with the policy objectives of the Act and to determine what basic broadband service should be. However, over the past couple of weeks, it became clear that there are also important issues regarding broadband adoption and poverty issues faced by some Canadians, who are barely able to make ends meet for food, shelter or clothing, let alone communications services. Indeed, where broadband fits within the broader poverty issues needs to be considered. ", "17888 These issues are certainly not simple and we don't think a solution to them can come from this one proceeding. We agree it may be appropriate to consider these issues as part of a national broadband strategy and the way forward likely needs coordination between the Commission and governments, along with input from other stakeholders.", "17889 We reviewed the nine National Broadband Task Force principles referred to earlier last week and we generally agree that they are an appropriate starting point to developing a national strategy. The Commission's expertise in data collection and reporting, along with experience gained over the years, positions it well to initiate the first stages of such a strategy.", "17890 While governments have and will continue to play a role in broadband deployment, they are also ultimately responsible for issues of digital literacy and the poverty issues faced by many Canadians. As industry, our expertise is in building networks and the provision of quality services. Our business focus in turn also helps to bolster the economy by providing communication services to individuals and to business. ", "17891 Where Eastlink and other industry members can provide value is through our experience and expertise, sharing opinions regarding the various funding models, information about our business and what works and what did not. We described some of our views on these issues in our submission.", "17892 Through a collaborative effort, we can also learn the views of various governments, and other participants, about what worked and what did not. Sharing this information will help drive a clear, and more efficient approach to a broadband strategy with the goal to be sustainable in the long term.", "17893 We will provide our views on some key issues, but first we think it is important to give some insight into our business.", "17894 Eastlink provides services to over 1,800 communities across 7 provinces in Canada. Our two largest serving areas are Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sudbury, Ontario, with our next largest, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and Delta, B.C., having subscriber levels below 20,000.", "17895 Of the over 1,800 communities we serve, 72 percent of them have fewer than 100 customers. We have invested billions into our networks to interconnect hundreds of these communities with fibre and to extend broadband and other services to these areas. Communities such as Timmins, Cochrane and Kirkland Lake, Ontario; Cold Lake and Grand Prairie, Alberta; Cavendish, PEI; Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia and Heart's Desire, Newfoundland.", "17896 Among other business considerations, the fact that Eastlink is able to provide Internet, TV and phone services has been critical to support our significant network investments.", "17897 Through competitive pressures, we have seen some changes to subscriber growth. Moreover, with more video streaming over the Internet we are experiencing a shift from TV subscribers to more reliance on the Internet. Yet even as Internet subscriber numbers remain relatively constant, usage is increasing so exponentially that in order to meet the demand of our current base of subscribers and to continue to improve services we must increase investments.", "17898 Eastlink does not have the urban operator advantages that the larger communication companies in Canada have. We cannot rely on densely populated major urban centers to bring in the margins for our investment, and in rural areas our per-household costs to build are higher when one considers not only the distance but also increased costs for pole attachments and operational costs to serve remote areas.", "17899 With fewer than 350,000 total internet subscribers, we are dwarfed by our direct telco competitor who has 3.4 million internet subscribers. We have been successful despite our rural footprint and low population density in the communities we serve.", "17900 Our investment in capacity is directly related to the increased usage of the internet. Capacity has increased by 40 to 60 percent year over year and we expect this trend to continue. From this perspective of rural-focused companies like us, it is critical to keep investing in our networks if we want Canada\u2019s broadband success to continue and to expand.", "17901 Natalie? ", "17902 MS. MacDONALD: In this regard, we offer our views on the following issues.", "17903 With regard to basic broadband service, we agree that a five/one megabits per second speed meets the basic needs of Canadians for now, although basic needs will likely require increased capacity in the future. ", "17904 With regard to aspirational goals, we agree that aspirational goals may help shape plans for broadband development. A 25 down three up megabits per second goal may be reasonable. ", "17905 With regard to data caps, in our experience, data caps have been necessary to manage our rural connect service and in other areas to manage the highest capacity users. Service providers need flexibility to implement caps in order to address increasing broadband usage and its replacement for other services by consumers. This may be even more important in the remote areas where capacity is restricted.", "17906 With regard to quality of service, this is not an issue for the vast majority of Canada. Some standards may be appropriate in exchange for subsidies.", "17907 With regard to the subsidy regime, we generally do not support a Commission mandated regime but, if necessary, in limited areas where the market or governments cannot bridge the gap subsidies should be carefully considered in order to keep them to a minimum. We generally support an auction approach. ", "17908 There are many approaches to how a subsidy would be directed and we have some views on a roadmap to getting there. Even after a regime is established, there should be a quick process for interveners before a build is finally approved to ensure new build plans have not developed over the intervening period.", "17909 Other areas for consideration by the Commission; the Commission has an important role to play in other aspects of our industry that can also impact our ability to maintain or expand our broadband services. For example, in our experience, support structure rates have been a major cost factor in building to rural areas. Currently Eastlink pays $12.5 million per year for support structure attachments to telcos and hydro utilities, and this does not even include make-ready and other permitting charges. And we are now facing exponential increases to support structure rates by hydro, rate increases from $22.35 per pole per year to upward of possibly $70 or more per pole. The impact is in the millions for our company. ", "17910 While hydro is not within the CRTC\u2019s jurisdiction, there are areas where the separate regulation allows for a shell game between hydro and telco, whereby licensees who are not joint users are paying more and sometimes to both parties. ", "17911 Another example for us is the impact of inequitable application of wholesale requirements. For example, the imbalance in the application of internet resale rules as between us and our largest competitor. Currently we must provide our highest speed services, up to 400 megabits per second, discounted by 25 percent off the lowest promotional rate, yet our direct competitor, who is over 10 times our size, must only provide wholesale access to its seven megabit service.", "17912 With regard to broadband strategy, as we said earlier today, we support that it may be time for our regulator, governments and industry to work together to build a national broadband strategy. This will help reduce duplication of investment, assess the most appropriate way to direct funding and to consider the broader social issues also highlighted during this proceeding. ", "17913 While it may add some additional steps to final solutions, and hence time, we favour the right solution over the fastest solution. This does not mean we cannot continue while that is worked out. Updating the evergreen project of mapping is one example.", "17914 We are pleased to answer any questions you have.", "17915 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well thank you very much. ", "17916 And certainly, Mr. Bragg, we very much appreciate when CEO\u2019s show up at important hearings, so we appreciate your presence. ", "17917 And I also want to congratulate you in supporting the role of very talented women in the regulatory proceeding. And I also note that your panel was set well ahead of the start of this oral hearing, so that\u2019s even more an honour in your favour because I think it\u2019s part of your company\u2019s DNA. So thank you very much for that.", "17918 Now, I\u2019ll put you in the hands of the Vice-Chair Telecommunications to start us off and others will no doubt follow.", "17919 Thank you.", "17920 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Morning. Thank you.", "17921 I\u2019m going to start with, as you noted in your presentation here that you\u2019d kind of come in to this proceeding noting it was about filling the gap. And there\u2019s sort of four areas here that appear to have -- appear, to me at least, to have been made evident here, and I want to see if you agree that ideas that pop out.", "17922 One is service to the north; one is service to satellite dependent communities; filling the gap sort of I call them semi-rural pockets that don\u2019t have adequate service or uneconomic and somehow they\u2019re just at the edge of connectivity, and service to remote often First nations communities. Would you agree that those are the sort of areas where the previous decision for -- to go with market forces and targeted government funding that at least in those areas the market forces aren\u2019t able to meet the connectivity needs?", "17923 MR. BRAGG: I think generally those are four reasonable buckets, and I think, you know, obviously there\u2019s some overlap in if you\u2019re an individual customer you might be in sort of two places at once if you\u2019re in the north and you\u2019re in a satellite only, however you want to define it. ", "17924 But I do agree that market forces have not taken the facilities to some of those areas at this stage, but I think that\u2019s part of the challenge is just the sheer magnitude of the economics to solve those issues, to get facilities into some of those areas it\u2019s somewhat staggering to be honest.", "17925 And, I mean, I know many have talked about, you know, whether it\u2019s a satellite solution that should be improved, or a fixed wireless solution, or cellular as a solution, or direct wireline connection. I would agree with many that have been here so far that a wireline solution is the best long-term solution. ", "17926 It\u2019s likely from an initial investment standpoint obviously the more expensive but also would require less upgrade in the long run, but it\u2019s still -- I think it\u2019s sort of the elephant in the room, it\u2019s just the sheer economic issue.", "17927 I mean, we looked at -- you know, Nova Scotia -- I mean, and that\u2019s part of the challenge too. I mean, everybody has talked about what their needs are and/or wants and that there are obviously a lot of underserved areas. But I truly believe there -- you know, no matter what we do there are always going to be some areas that are not serviced as well as others. ", "17928 Because I just -- if you do the math -- and we\u2019ve done some of the math for Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia is the second most densely populated province. We cover -- I think there\u2019s roughly about 20,000 homes that are not serviced by a wireline solution. We\u2019ve been -- had a partnership with the provincial government to build a fixed wireless solution to try to service those. We had a mandate of doing 1.5 megabits a second five years ago because that seemed to be determined as fitting the needs. Kind of by the time we were done it doesn\u2019t fit the needs, the needs or wants. And I\u2019m still confused on what\u2019s a need and what\u2019s a want. ", "17929 But -- so now we\u2019re talking about should it be five, should it be 10, but it\u2019s just pouring more and more money into it, and that was a $100 million project. It didn\u2019t -- it still did not connect everybody. ", "17930 But we did the math on what it would take to build a wireline solution, we did the engineering, and we stopped -- for the 20,000 homes we stopped at 1,600 where we actually did the math and we took the most densely populated areas and we get up to $72,000 a home at the top end and it only got worse from there. It was $45 million to build 1,600 unserviced homes, still leaving 17 or 18,000 not done.", "17931 So if we extrapolated that out, even if the density didn't get any worse than the 72,000, which I know it does, it's in the neighbourhood of a billion-and\u2011a\u2011half dollars just for Nova Scotia, the second most densely populated area.", "17932 So when we look and consider the magnitude of the North -- and we operate in Northern Alberta and Northern Ontario, so we're very familiar with the amount of geography and how spread out these areas are -- like it's tens of billions of dollars to solve this issue. Plus we also know we couldn't afford to operate with the pole rate attachments and the operating cost to manage a network that is that sparsely done.", "17933 We'd need a subsidy of about $1,500 -- it's about $1,000 a year per customer just for the poles, just to attach the poles, plus the additional operating costs to operate a network that's that big with so few customers attached -- we'd need about a $1,500 a year subsidy to keep the rate, the per month rate, the same for customers in the rest of the network.", "17934 So if you extrapolate that out across the country, it's tens of billions of dollars to build it and maybe a billion or two a year to maintain it. And it's just -- it's a staggering amount of money.", "17935 So I think that's -- I agree that those are the unserved areas, and I -- but I think we have to look at, well, what are the cost-effective things that can be done to increase service to certain pockets, whether it's...", "17936 Like I do think we've had some success in some partnership with government, and others, and subsidies on the backbone issue. I can get my head around that. Once you get some fibre to a community sometimes you can let the market forces define the community, and we've seen success at that.", "17937 Newfoundland is a good example where we partnered with the Newfoundland Government, and a couple of other carriers, to build a fibre backbone across Newfoundland itself ---", "17938 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I'm going to get into that a bit later.", "17939 MR. BRAGG: Okay.", "17940 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay? So before we go right through, do you mind if I just stop you here ---", "17941 MR. BRAGG: Oh, no, no, please.", "17942 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- and ---", "17943 MR. BRAGG: But this -- I mean, I ---", "17944 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I can tell you're passionate about it.", "17945 MR. BRAGG: --- this is a big issue.", "17946 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, I know.", "17947 Do you have -- I mean, when you came to those financial estimates. I mean, Bell was in here a week ago talking $1.7 billion for some of the issues we were talking about, and that's a lot of money, but it's not tens of billions, as you were saying.", "17948 Would you ---", "17949 MR. BRAGG: But that was just their area in the North.", "17950 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, yes. You were talking about all across ---?", "17951 MR. BRAGG: M'hm.", "17952 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, we'll just leave that there for now. And I was going to ask you about National Digital Strategy and coordination of issues, and that, but you've answered all that in your oral presentation, so I'm not going to.", "17953 But in terms of that filling the gap item, I just had one, and you may have addressed it a little bit previously here, but I wanted to read you a comment from one of our online, in terms of our online discussion coming in. And it was posted on April 25", "th", ", which was Monday. I just know it's Day 14.", "17954 Anyway, it's from John S. -- John, NS:", "17955 \"I live on a road with about 10 or 12 people over a 4 or 5 kilometre stretch. This road is off a secondary highway. There is high-speed service on the highway but both Bell and Eastlink say it's not worth their expense to bring service to us; it will not happen.", "17956 We've offered to pay more, sign multi-year contracts, and even asked about cost sharing, if we can raise a reasonable amount. They won't budge. I understand they are in it to make money and I don't begrudge that; however, the money poured into programs, like broadband, wireless Internet, and 5 and 1 are misplaced and short-sighted.", "17957 By the time companies get around to actually doing it, since there's little profit in it for them -- profit for them, they drag -- since there's little profit in it for them, they drag their feet. The target goal is already years and years behind -- years and years and years behind.\"", "17958 So what do folks in industry -- how should we respond to people with an issue like that? I mean, they're near a highway, there's connectivity, and they phone companies -- and I'm not trying to pick on you, because I could pick this \u2013 any place across the country. How do we respond to those folks, because it must be -- they're not that far away?", "17959 MR. BRAGG: I think they're not that far away on a mileage basis but they're a long way away from a dollar basis, and I think that tends to be the challenge. That people underestimate how much it costs to build.", "17960 It's, you know, in the neighbourhood of $40,000 a kilometre to build a network, so when somebody tells me, well, but I have three or four neighbours and I'm only 5 kilometres away from your fibre run, well, there's a -- first a fixed cost to break into the fibre and then $40,000. So I'm at 200, maybe $250,000 to go connect them.", "17961 And people, they say, oh, surely that can't be right. I mean, I get that a lot. And I say, well, I'm afraid it is right. And people offer, they say, but I'd pay $1,000 to get hooked up. I agree, but you won't pay $50,000 to get hooked up, and that's the issue.", "17962 So I understand that I'm not necessarily answering your question on what do you say or how do you articulate that but, I mean, we have to articulate that to customers all the time, or potential customers, people who want service. And it's -- it just -- it's a lot of money. I mean, and I don't -- to be honest, I don't really know how you answer it, other than to say it's a lot of money.", "17963 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But I'm trying to understand that in terms of your opposition to a subsidy of -- I mean, you concede subsidy, and some is maybe necessary in some areas, but you're very cautious about it, and there's nothing wrong with being prudent. But that seems to me to be a situation where, as we made the point earlier, the market can't serve. It's not it doesn't want to, it just -- it's uneconomic, it doesn't work, it's not a burden that is appropriate for those conditions.", "17964 So that would be the sort of situation you'd look at in terms of subsidy or funding or connectivity of some kind. So wouldn't that sort of situation be -- doesn't that illustrate the need for some form of subsidy regime or are there other solutions that we could look at? Because it seems to be -- it can't be you, it can't be the companies, and if it can't be government, what happens?", "17965 MR. BRAGG: I mean, Natalie, you may want to add to this, but I don't think we said we're dead set against a subsidy, but I think it's ---", "17966 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, you conceded that it's -- you know, there may be regions and that sort of stuff, but ---", "17967 MR. BRAGG: Oh, no. I think -- but I think that's the -- I mean, I think that's part of the challenge is there may be a subsidy structure that with enough foresight will solve some issues in some places. But I think it's -- I think we all have to be prepared that it won't solve all the issues in all the places.", "17968 And that's -- and even if we got half the homes that are underserved, unserved, you know, still that's better than where we are now, but it's -- you know, I think there are so many moving parts and how -- I just -- I have yet to really figure out what the right subsidy model is.", "17969 And I think that's why it's -- it was -- it's hard for me to say, oh, I agree with the subsidy, because it's easy to say subsidy but how do you handle the ongoing upgrade requirements and/or the operational costs and not necessarily put an unfair burden on other customers. And if you did put that burden on other customers, how do you do it equally across all providers in say the lower cost area, if you're going to cross-subsidize. It's just -- it's ---", "17970 MS. MacDONALD: And if I could just add on the subsidy topic, our cautionary message is really just about making sure that we put the right time and review into those target areas so that we can hopefully get it right long term where that's possible. So as Lee said, in the cases where maybe there is the opportunity for certain communities to benefit from a transport or a fibre build for a transport network. And if a company can be sustainable and build the access component without ongoing subsidies, that could be targeted as an area for success.", "17971 Now, I agree that in some of these areas, as you described, where it appears there is no real solution, those areas need to be flagged for consideration for a solution through a regime that may involve subsidies, whether through government or through the subsidy regime from the Commission. ", "17972 But just getting back to the issue of what will the markets do, even in some of our areas that are seriously troubled in terms of the technology, so the rural connect area in Nova Scotia that we referred to, there are communities in that area that a few years ago we didn\u2019t even think we would be able to build and upgrade our own plant over. And we\u2019ve managed over the last year and a half to move into some of those areas where we could make a case. Not a great case, but a case to invest. And we\u2019ve been able to build services to another close to 800 homes in those areas at an investment. ", "17973 But again, if you had asked us a few years ago if we could even do that, we probably wouldn\u2019t have expected to be able to say yes. And we\u2019re still focussing on those areas to see if there\u2019s solutions, but they\u2019re very troubled.", "17974 And so I guess I\u2019m just saying that market can still get to some of those difficult areas. And so our approach to a cautionary model for the subsidy is really let\u2019s really be careful how we define what areas really need the subsidy. And then what areas -- of what\u2019s left, let\u2019s put them into two buckets. ", "17975 The bucket of there\u2019s no other solution other than perhaps satellite, which that creates a clear route to what are we going to do, because if there\u2019s no other solution that\u2019s probably the answer, at least in the interim. ", "17976 And then the other bucket is communities with multiple characteristics that could benefit from multiple types of technologies. And we\u2019re saying let\u2019s look at those, and that might be the coordinated government approach with the Commission and industry stakeholders to say what would work? What are the costs? And that\u2019s where we don\u2019t necessarily say the lowest cost bid is necessarily the right answer if there\u2019s a reasonable long-term sustainable solution that could be achieved with maybe a little bit more, but it isn\u2019t the lowest cost.", "17977 So we think that that\u2019s sort of the model that -- at least some ideas toward a model that can slowly shorten the gap in terms of the services available and hopefully have some communities that are more sustainable.", "17978 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. And so one of the things that could be mentioned to John NS is have you phoned Xplornet.", "17979 MS. MacDONALD: That\u2019s right.", "17980 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "17981 MS. MacDONALD: Yeah.", "17982 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So things which may be possible. ", "17983 Okay. I want to talk about the speed targets of five and one. Again, and it\u2019s -- I mean, that\u2019s an aspirational goal we set five years ago. And it was met or exceeded, and mostly exceeded pretty much everywhere, and it was met in many, many areas that people were skeptical that it would never be met. So it was broadly successful. ", "17984 But it seems to me that it doesn\u2019t seem very ambitious to then go through this and go with a five and one, although most industry representatives have been doing it. And a little bit of that is the want and need. I understand that.", "17985 But as we\u2019ve gone through it, I just -- we\u2019ll read you the list and some of this is -- I know there\u2019s demand driven by online video and Netflix and that sort of stuff. But there\u2019s also been a shift, you know, as more and more government services, more and more companies expect people to be accessible at home to maybe be able to do, you know, access a BPN network, all kinds of different things; right? ", "17986 So we\u2019ve got things that five years ago weren\u2019t, when we set an aspiration of five and one, weren\u2019t nearly as intensive as they are now. The number of government services available online are online only. Job searches, I mean, you can only do that online; right? Access to news and current affairs even is becoming -- becomes more online as newspapers die and traditional TV news is declining. Education systems almost universally assign work that demands connectivity, sometimes with multiple -- well, frequent -- most of the time with multiple kids in the house, I think. So the needs have been expended. ", "17987 There\u2019s a list here in -- looking at them later today. Anyway, I could go on, but you get my point in terms of all that stuff. So wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to at least move to 10 and 1? Because, I mean, you talk to yourself about the demand growth and that sort of stuff. And I know some of it is, you know, whether I get HD or not. That was mentioned as an appropriate border line and that sort of stuff. But there are more needs now than there were five years ago in terms of fundamental needs.", "17988 Would you agree? And then I\u2019m giving you the opportunity to defend why five and one is still sufficient to meet those.", "17989 MR. BRAGG: I think five and one arguably is sufficient today. Is 10 and 3 or 25 and 3 better? Yes. Again, it comes back to the economics involved to getting there.", "17990 The -- I got scolded once before for using the phrase \u201coverly honest\u201d. But really, speed is not the hard part. Capacity\u2019s the hard part. Often network providers use speed as a throttling mechanism to not chew up too much capacity on the network. ", "17991 So whether it\u2019s 5, 10, 25, the big issue, does the network have enough capacity to meet the demands of all the customers attached to it?", "17992 You know, there are some things, you do need a certain amount of speed to just accomplish, you know. So it\u2019s -- if you pick 5, it\u2019s going to need to be 10 3 to 5 years from now. If you pick 10, you buy yourself a little more time. But it\u2019s going to be a moving target forever and ever and ever.", "17993 MS. MacDONALD: And I think I would just add to that. I agree with what Lee just said. And, you know, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not sure if you would have in reading our written submission seen that -- the struggle there because we were talking about needs and then wants and saying we\u2019re not satisfied providing a level of service that we\u2019re providing on a fixed wireless network.", "17994 But anyway, having said that, the five and one is the question needs today. But we absolutely acknowledge, and I\u2019ve heard a number of other parties here say, when you\u2019re looking at planning to build in underserved or unserved areas, it might be the most reasonable approach to build toward a higher. So a number of people have said 10/1 might be what you build. Maybe the 5/1 is how you target where do we go first? So obviously we need a plan and we need to look at those communities that are unserved and underserved.", "17995 So communities that have a 5/1 if basic needs are being met. Communities that are unserved maybe are priority in terms of a targeted plan. The aspirational targets is where the 5/1s will get.", "17996 And so it may be just a part of how do we build that plan. And the 5/1, those who have it today, those basic needs are being met, maybe not all wants. And let\u2019s target the areas that are below that.", "17997 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Just in terms of capacity issues, it\u2019s one of the issues that\u2019s been raised fairly often is data cap management and that sort of stuff. And one of the accusations people make from time to time -- and you referred to it today in terms of capacity issues and that sort of stuff. And I understand that. ", "17998 But I wanted to give you the opportunity, not necessarily on your own behalf, but perhaps an industry view or maybe it happens elsewhere. People suggest that that may have been the original purpose of data caps was to -- was capacity management, but it has become for some a very positive revenue stream. And that that is one of the reasons why it\u2019s maintained as it is. How would you respond to that?", "17999 MR. BRAGG: I mean, I think you can do that and use it as a revenue generator if you want to. I mean, we know the majority of our customers do not go over our caps. It\u2019s a network management technique that we use to try to protect ourselves from big, big users that sort of that would cost us more than the revenue they generate.", "18000 It\u2019s a -- you know, I mean, in our experience it\u2019s definitely not an economic decision, other than it potentially delays capital that we have to put in the network to add more capacity. So you could argue there\u2019s an economic benefit from that. ", "18001 But it\u2019s -- I mean, from my perspective, it\u2019s truly -- it\u2019s a network management technique.", "18002 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And should -- do you think data caps should be part of a basic service objective definition?", "18003 MR. BRAGG: I don\u2019t -- I think it\u2019s hard to determine. Everybody designs a network a little differently so they\u2019re going to need to manage it differently. So if there\u2019s a certain amount of capacity and you see a certain level of usage depending on the design of the type of network, you -- you know, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m thinking of it from an engineering standpoint. But that\u2019s how it\u2019s done and why it\u2019s done, from our perspective.", "18004 So I mean, Nathalie, you might be able to ---", "18005 MS. MacDONALD: I\u2019d like to just go back a little step into what Lee was describing, because the issue of data caps for us is absolutely about network management, and I want to explain our logic in going there with the rural connect. Not the best example I understand because it\u2019s not our favourite service to be offering, but it really highlights the challenge with caps and how we had to think about trying to deal with the traffic in that area. And then I\u2019ll explain the distinction in our other areas that are well-served by internet.", "18006 So in the areas where -- in our rural connect service areas obviously we described in detail the challenges that we had, because it\u2019s a capacity limited system with a number of people relying on it and usage has increased so much over the last 10 years that we just simply cannot manage the capacity on that network and provide a service that we want to be providing to our customers there.", "18007 The rate for that service -- it\u2019s a 1.5 meg service -- we charge $46.95. That rate was established under a contract that was worked through in the mid-2000s and executed in 2007. And that contract required that we keep that rate, and it was based on the comparable rate that was offered in the urban centers, and we were not permitted to increase that rate during the entire term of the contract, notwithstanding that we\u2019d gone over -- $20 million over the budget.", "18008 So when the contract ended and we began to really experience usage problems, and it was starting to build over the years as people began to use the internet more, we were struggling with how to manage the capacity, and we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to increase the rates for everyone, we thought well this is a network management issue. So we established a data included usage and we had to do some work to try to figure out what to get to, and in doing so we said well this service was created in the mid -- basically the mid-2000s that\u2019s when it was -- the idea was -- came about for the 1.5 meg service on a fixed wireless, and it was built for what at that time was expected to be used for, which was basic web browsing, email, online banking, very light video usage, if any, but not the kind of gaming and high-def streaming that we\u2019re seeing today. ", "18009 So we looked at that and we said well let\u2019s look at what the usage would be to try to arrive at a cap that we can try to manage the network because of the limitations, and we subtracted sort of from the usage what was the obvious high video streaming that wouldn\u2019t have been the excess and got down to a cap of about -- sorry -- a usage that we expected was for necessities at about 12 gig -- not very high I know -- and then we upped it by another three gig to allow for some extra usage and we set a usage cap at 15.", "18010 Now, we don\u2019t call it a cap we call it included usage because we don\u2019t just end it there. So then we said well we\u2019ll charge an extra for anyone who uses over and that we\u2019ll try to manage some of these excessive users so that our other users have a valid good experience or at least an improved experience, but we also didn\u2019t keep charging for every gig. So we charged $2 extra per gig to a cap at 20. So again we didn\u2019t keep charging over and above. So the highest a customer would pay in that area is $66.95 for the 1.5 service, and that would give them at that 20 cap unlimited usage after $20.", "18011 So I just wanted to explain that, because even with that model it was challenging, because basically we had a number of users, all of those were below the included usage were at about a five gig a month usage, all of those that were under the $20 extra averaged about a 19 gig a month usage, and then the ones that were over were -- I\u2019m talking we\u2019ve got people that are at 300 gig a month and we\u2019re trying to figure out how to deal with it because it\u2019s really impacting the network for others. And so it seemed like the ones that were saying \u201cWell we\u2019re going to do whatever we want with the service and we\u2019re going to pay the extra 20 and then it\u2019s unlimited\u201d those are the ones that use it quickly and continue to use it and those are the challenges.", "18012 Now, that\u2019s a very unique situation that we\u2019re experiencing because the rest of our network is well built and it has the capacity to serve, but then the rest of our network has very high included usage and the vast majority of our customers aren\u2019t exceeding that.", "18013 The exception to that -- so we primarily try to sell multiple services, as we said, so our bundled customers well within the usage, no issue at all. The customers who are not bundling -- so they\u2019ve chosen not to take a TV service -- the standalone internet customers, they\u2019re using significant -- sorry -- significant usage but not necessarily above our caps because our caps are still pretty good, but they\u2019re the ones that we\u2019re seeing people go above the cap. So what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re just replacing what we would say two services, maybe three if you count the VOIP, for the price in their minds of one service. So that\u2019s just sort of the logic. ", "18014 So we would say that our approach to included usage and what everyone\u2019s been referring to as caps for our well served areas is not about making money -- more money on the cap, otherwise we would have offered a shorter -- a lower included usage and charged more, and we\u2019re not getting those extra charges for usage.", "18015 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I mean ---", "18016 MS. MacDONALD: I hope that helps clarify the situation.", "18017 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: No, I understand that. Should the issue of data caps be addressed in the basic service objective?", "18018 MR. BRAGG: Yeah, I think it needs to be.", "18019 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That was the original question. I mean, bits don\u2019t travel for free across the network. So if somebody\u2019s going to use more -- I mean, it\u2019s like anything, if they use more power they pay for it, if they\u2019re on a water system and they use more water they pay for it. And I think in order to make sure there\u2019s some fairness that, you know, if there\u2019s big users on the network that are driving costs that may end up being borne by all the customers, you know, I think you should have to have a mechanism that allows the bigger users that are driving the costs to pay more.", "18020 MS. MacDONALD: I think where we would be concerned ---", "18021 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, just let me -- what I\u2019m trying to get at is the affordability issue for some people. It was brought forward to us that they need -- because they have multiple children in the house doing homework and that sort of stuff, especially for people who are challenged financially this becomes an issue if they go over their data cap trying to manage their finances and that.", "18022 So what I was trying to get, should we set a standard that says people should get at least this many gigs, right, or -- that\u2019s what I was trying to get at, to address those things. And maybe in your answer there you could also think -- I\u2019m also curious to know about what do you do -- how do you help your customers manage their usage in terms of that so that they don\u2019t get sort of a surprise?", "18023 MS. MacDONALD: If I could start and then Lee can add anything if I\u2019ve missed anything.", "18024 So in terms of should the Commission set a standard at a minimum usage, our initial response would be we would be very concerned about setting a minimum if that minimum wasn\u2019t -- there would be risks if it impeded our ability to properly manage our usage and our network especially in troubled areas or challenged areas.", "18025 So in that respect we would say the market -- the service provider should have the flexibility to provide and establish reasonable usage. But we understand where the Commission would be concerned and that would be unreasonable, and so if the Commission were going in that direction we would say it really could be an impact on our business if that wasn\u2019t set properly.", "18026 Because if the cap is too high the cost of us to keep that network running for one service at a very generous cap could impede our ability to continue our investment. And I say that because of our strategy in building in rural areas and trying to sell multiple products we need to have some flexibility in pricing the standalone to cover it if people are choosing one service.", "18027 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And how do you manage your customers in terms of helping them manage their data cap?", "18028 MS. MacDONALD: So we have a very well trained customer care team who is able to work through -- talk to our customers about the service options available But realistically it\u2019s not become a huge challenge for us at this point or for our customers because we\u2019ve got the rural connect area which has one service, one plan and one method for caps. We have online tools for people to go in and see where they are and to talk through that with our customer care reps. And in our other served areas the caps are so high that we\u2019re really not seeing an issue there, although they have management tools as well to go in and look at their usage as well. ", "18029 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. And what\u2019s the cheapest package -- the most affordable package that you offer?", "18030 MR. BRAGG: Natalie, you have some of the details on that I think, don\u2019t you?", "18031 MS. MacDONALD: Yes.", "18032 So we do have services across different service areas and some of them are, you know, and DSL areas as well. We would say our most affordable -- so if we take a given service area, and I think you've raised the issue of the Atlantic has come up and the Maritimes, and that's one of -- we're from Halifax.", "18033 So if we look at the Halifax area, our most affordable service is when we provide a bundled service because it allows us to provide a value discount.", "18034 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sure.", "18035 MS. MacDONALD: The standalone ---", "18036 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The standalone ---", "18037 MS. MacDONALD: --- service for our Internet, our broadband, we have a 50 meg service and the price in the Halifax area is around an $82 price point. There is no -- it's unlimited usage at that price point.", "18038 We also have wireless services as well that are extremely competitive. We would say that any of our wireless options that are comparable to competitors are at a better value and a better rate. And so we have services there, starting at, I think, in the -- well, there's a page you go that starts at, you know, $25 and there's a $15 plan for people who just want text, and so we've got those services as well.", "18039 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That seems high, compared to some of the others we've heard. Is that an issue of regional costs or regional company costs? Because I believe your competitors' rates are, in Nova Scotia at least, very similar?", "18040 MR. BRAGG: Yeah, I mean, I -- there's two factors. One is there's -- there is a significant amount of competition. So we have to balance ourselves to make sure we're not, you know, obviously, overpriced relative to our competitors, but the other big driving factor is just the rural nature of our networks.", "18041 We cover a significant amount of geography with not very many people living in it, so our capital costs per customer are much higher than others that have more urban dominated markets. So that tends to drive the cost structure from an Eastlink standpoint.", "18042 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Before I forget, I have an undertaking request that you could please provide us -- this is a brief interlude in our conversation -- please provide us with copies of your Internet service agreements, contracts, and related terms and conditions.", "18043 MS. MacDONALD: Sure, we'll do that.", "18044 ", " UNDERTAKING", "18045 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "18046 MR. BRAGG: I hate to interrupt, but on our cellular Internet product as well or only our sort of wireline or fixed ---?", "18047 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Only Internet.", "18048 MR. BRAGG: Okay, well, we do sell some Internet only over our cellular network. We'll throw it in.", "18049 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You know -- yes. I mean, send too much rather than too less.", "18050 MR. BRAGG: Sure.", "18051 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I'm sure people will...", "18052 I just want to go back. When you were talking about -- in your original submission, last July, you made reference to the Far North, and I want you to clarify a bit in this context because it could be critiqued this way; all right.", "18053 So you make reference to why people in the Far North should not have broadband -- addressing the issue of should they have broadband access at comparable rates because -- and I think you say, because everything costs more there. Food costs more, everything.", "18054 And I thought that some people might find that position a little blunt and perhaps even uncharitable. And just in the context of Canada's longstanding tradition of -- I mean, we've -- we do transfer payments to make sure that people have similar access to basic standards of healthcare and education, for instance.", "18055 And some people in the North might look at that and say, well, why wouldn't the same philosophy apply to connectivity; right. I mean, they concede in most polls that they're going to have to pay more, but ---", "18056 MS. MacDONALD: And ---", "18057 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- why wouldn't they ---?", "18058 MS. MacDONALD: So I think I'd like to clarify that as well, because we certainly wouldn't -- from our perspective, when we looked at those decisions, there seemed to be a reference to the Far North requiring rates in line with rates in Southern Canada for the same services. And we would recognize that in some higher cost areas, comparable may mean a little more, but identical to a very competitive market, in a more lower cost to build market we don't necessarily think that's the right way to establish the price.", "18059 And if that wasn't clear, that would be really what we were getting at. We need to be aware that there are higher costs in some of these areas and so there needs to be, obviously, reasonalbe, in light of the situation as well, but comparable but not exactly the same.", "18060 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thanks for clarifying.", "18061 While on the North, I just have one more question on that, because I thought you might have -- be a little helpful in terms of this because you have experience with submarine fibre cabling and I believe you interconnected with -- at some point with TELE Greenland port there. So -- and they have a fibre line, you know, from Greenland -- you know -- from Greenland to Newfoundland, but for the record, but also they connect to Europe through Iceland.", "18062 And when I was reading up on it, because I was trying to get my head around how much it would cost to connect Nunavut, it was like somebody spent $150 million and they managed to run submarine cables. That was the price I read in the -- reading the St. John's newspaper, anyway, to connect to Greenland by fibre, and to both Iceland and Newfoundland.", "18063 How much do you think, with your experience with that, it might cost to connect a fibre -- submarine fibre line to -- I mean, just your best guess?", "18064 MR. BRAGG: From where to where?", "18065 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Well, is -- would it be possible to connect to that submarine line between the TELE Greenland from Iqaluit?", "18066 MR. BRAGG: I mean, anything's possible, but to pull it up and put a branching unit in, I don't know how much -- what the fibre count is on that cable off the top of my head. So I don't know whether that makes sense to do.", "18067 I just -- I don't know. You'd have to go to your -- where is the nearest point where you can get access to a good fibre connection and build it so it's distance and -- I don't know, 150 million. I mean, I don't know how far it is from -- well, I know where Nunavut is but I don't know where we're going on the other side. So I think that's...", "18068 I mean, the environment's tricky. You're going to have significant repair issues. Our fibre between -- we have sort of double -- we have redundancy and then we partner with another carrier. So we end up with sort of three routes from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland, and it gets cut a couple of times a year and we have to repair it.", "18069 So you know -- and so to go to the Far North undersea is a challenge that if there's ice cover you're not going to be able to fix it until the ice goes, so that's not a pleasant undertaking. You know, again, anything's possible, but that's -- so you might be able to build it with a reasonable amount of money but you might not be able to look after it.", "18070 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And the reasonable amount of money for the build would be?", "18071 MR. BRAGG: If we were going from, I don't know, Nuuk in Greenland is how far to Nunavut? I'm just trying to picture a map. Eight hundred (800) miles, 1,000 miles?", "18072 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, it's about that. It's about a two\u2011hour, hour-and\u2011a\u2011half flight.", "18073 MR. BRAGG: So yeah, likely, yeah, 150 -- I only know this because we just did some pricing to Bermuda from Halifax and it's about the same distance, give or take a little. So 150 million.", "18074 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, I was just trying to get that. And it's always fun to have Bermuda and Greenland in the same conversation.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "18075 MR. BRAGG: It doesn't happen very often.", "18076 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Now, thank you for that.", "18077 What I want to -- I want to talk really now about your experience that you outlined today and in your written submission regarding funds to build. You contrasted the -- your experience with the one in Nova Scotia, which you've talked about a bit, and it was sort of familiar with the one that, to keep it simple, did not work, and the one in Newfoundland that you think is better.", "18078 And I'm thinking in the context, because we've talked a little bit today about transport, and Shaw said yesterday if you're going to fund something, transport, and that's come up more, and that's seems to be one of the other emerging themes in terms of that.", "18079 So if funds are to be created to build out access, how should they be -- what should they focus on and how should they be structured, from your experience?", "18080 MR. BRAGG: I think transport makes the most sense. Now, part of that is because we know it's worked in a few indications. I gave the Newfoundland example but I also think we've taken advantage of the SuperNet fibre that\u2019s managed by Axia now in Alberta. That really worked. And what it allowed to do is it took away the barrier of that -- you know, use an example a little bit earlier of, you know, a cluster of home that are -- well we\u2019re only 10 kilometres away from the Eastlink fibre and there\u2019s 15 or 20 homes, well it\u2019s the 10 kilometres that\u2019s the issue.", "18081 If you get enough density within a small community the market can build that. So if you can get over that transport or that connectivity to the community hurdle, which a subsidized transport network can do, I think then you end up with a more manageable subsidy scheme because you\u2019re -- there\u2019s less issue around ongoing subsidy requirements.", "18082 Because a buried or an aerial plant of fibre tends to not need as much ongoing maintenance, ongoing cost issue, and it gets into that community then, you know, there might be lots of people that might be able to afford to build out and operate in a non-subsidy model on a per customer basis to build that.", "18083 So I think there is still lots of examples of communities in Canada where that can really work well, and you get the best bang for the buck, it\u2019s the less contentious, the easiest to manage, easiest for people to get their heads around.", "18084 MS. MacDONALD: And I agree. And that\u2019s sort of what we were thinking when we think about a coordinated effort and working with the government and the Commission is let\u2019s figure out what the right priorities are to how to direct that money. ", "18085 And we would say if you can create a sustainable business from a service provider who won\u2019t need to rely on subsidies -- and there may be very specific characteristics of those communities that are able to do that, but let\u2019s look at those and see what we can do so that we can do away with the subsidy question in the future and then we just have a smaller group of communities to figure out.", "18086 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But do you think that the current announcements -- I mean, the federal government made announcements for $500 million for its Canada Connect plan, and there was money there as well for a different stream for First Nations connectivity and that. If you were in charge of that, how would you structure that in terms of again, would you shift it to a focus on transport?", "18087 MR. BRAGG: I think it should be focused on transport. I mean, does that consume at all? I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a likelihood. But I think it still may be sort of a bid process where if you take a community that\u2019s un-serviced and say, you know, if there was -- you know, talk to the carriers in the region, say who\u2019s -- how much do you need to connect that, I mean, that\u2019s one way to do it. It could be more of a -- you know, I mean, not to be too crazy, the government could build it. I mean, because it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s kind of a benign thing, the fibre network, and then just let anybody on to it.", "18088 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It is a transportation corridor. So you\u2019d -- one of the suggestions then would be that government just go ahead and build it, the transport network?", "18089 MR. BRAGG: Yeah, and then allow access to whoever wants to provide service in that community.", "18090 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. Then it would be an open network like the SuperNet ---", "18091 MR. BRAGG: Sure.", "18092 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- in terms of management like that.", "18093 MR. BRAGG: I mean, that\u2019s one way to do it. You know, another is you could just, you know, ask people how much would you need, and if Bell wanted $10 million to connect some little community, and Eastlink wanted seven well you\u2019d give it to Eastlink. I mean, that\u2019s sort of the -- more of an auction.", "18094 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Reverse auction.", "18095 MR. BRAGG: Yeah. Like there are -- you know, I think the concept of focusing on transport first is the right concept. I\u2019m sure there are, you know, lots of different mechanical structures we could go through to figure it out.", "18096 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Thank you. Those are my questions.", "18097 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner MacDonald?", "18098 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good morning.", "18099 We\u2019ve heard from a number of different intervenors that they have difficulty when they want to launch a local service provide last mile access in a community they have trouble either a) discovering what transport facilities, what fibre facilities are out there, or they have difficulty accessing them at a competitive rate. ", "18100 And I know obviously Eastlink has a carrier department. You deal with other carriers frequently. When you receive a request, how do you evaluate whether you\u2019re able to support that request for transport facilities and how do you arrive at a price point that you\u2019re willing to offer someone wanting to access those facilities?", "18101 MS. MacDONALD: Okay. I thought you were going down a different direction there so I was preparing for a different question.", "18102 MR. BRAGG: But you\u2019re still going to answer this one.", "18103 MS. MacDONALD: Well, you can take it on as well if you want to go there.", "18104 But we do have a separate group that sells the wholesale services. And, in fact, you know, the topic came up throughout the week about availability of your network, and we consider that a line of business, and so we\u2019ve got an aggressive sales team that\u2019s interested in selling access to fibre routes, you know, across the country, and we have a website that maps that out. If you go onto Eastlink\u2019s business site you\u2019ll see the wholesale side of the business and the map showing what is available. ", "18105 And so my answer to what -- how do we go about making sure it\u2019s competitive is we pay for transport across the country. We are very aggressive in trying to get the best and most reasonable prices, and we have some challenges at times of course. And our sales force is also aggressive in wanting to sell. And so I would say that, you know, we look at the market, look at the rates, look at the costs and willingly make it available to third parties that are looking for access.", "18106 I would like to comment though, if I may -- I know the question wasn\u2019t asked. But with regard to the issue of transport and the challenges where there\u2019s only one provider -- and I won\u2019t take too long. But we are primarily facilities-based and we try to build all of our own facilities but, as Lee said, we do rely on third parties for transport getting to some of those hard to reach areas and we do rely on it in a number of those hard to reach areas. ", "18107 In areas where there\u2019s competition we\u2019ve not had too much of a problem. And in the case of some of our northern Ontario systems, the benefit of having competitive routes that are reasonably priced because of competition is that it actually enabled us to justify our builds. And so we built 19 systems out north of North Bay covering Timmins, New Liskeard, Kirkland Lake, Kapuskasing because we were able to get a reasonable transport rate at a competitive rate, and that was through the Ontara(phonetic) Transport. There are concerns that we have in the limited areas where there\u2019s only one provider and the rates are 10 to 20 times more in some cases.", "18108 So I just wanted to get that on the record because it is relevant. And while we don\u2019t rely on third parties as much there are other companies that do and so I just wanted to make that statement that there really is an issue where there is only one access to transport facility in a certain route.", "18109 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So just a follow-up, because you\u2019ve clearly done it, you\u2019ve relied on other providers and leveraged the benefits of there being competition on some of those transport routes, would you like to speak to the Alberta SuperNet model?", "18110 Axia was in a few days ago and spoke to us and they were very much of the belief that if you build it people will come. If you build the transport facilities if it\u2019s set at a fair price point other providers will go and build out their last mile infrastructure, be it fibre-optics, be it fixed wireless, or what have you. So you\u2019re very much, I would assume, of the opinion that that\u2019s an accurate statement on their part.", "18111 MR. BRAGG: Generally I think that\u2019s right. I mean, it\u2019s -- there has to be some \u201cthey\u201d to come though. I mean, so it\u2019s -- you know, Alberta structure was pretty good where they connected a lot of different communities. So there were some they\u2019s that -- whether it\u2019s ourselves, or Shaw, or TELUS, or whoever is servicing those, or multiple providers, will go after some of those communities and take advantage of that fibre backbone that was created.", "18112 If you get into some very rural remote areas sometimes, you know, it might be a stretch if you decided to, you know, build fibre on that model to some really remote area there just might not be enough business or commercial activity to get that many people coming to it. So anyhow everything\u2019s a bit of a balance from that standpoint.", "18113 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Thank you.", "18114 THE CHAIRPERSON: Just a few more questions. Do you track complaints in your various systems with respect to internet?", "18115 MR. BRAGG: Yes.", "18116 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you be able to give us -- I know you have several systems, I\u2019m not sure how you could do this, but the top three types of complaints you get from your customers across your systems?", "18117 MS. MacDONALD: Yes, we can provide that.", "18118 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So you can do that as an undertaking.", "18119 ", " UNDERTAKING", "18120 MR. BRAGG: Would you -- I think it would be important that we do it across the different types of networks we have to separate our fixed wireline versus our wireless, because I think that's ---", "18121 THE CHAIRPERSON: Sure.", "18122 MR. BRAGG: --- likely helpful.", "18123 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, because I think we'll probably see a pattern there because ---", "18124 MR. BRAGG: Yeah.", "18125 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- the technology would have some sort of impact; right?", "18126 MR. BRAGG: Yeah.", "18127 MS. MacDONALD: I would just qualify that slightly, to the extent that we actually them, but ---", "18128 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah.", "18129 MS. MacDONALD: --- we will obviously attempt to do that as well.", "18130 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, right. So you know what we're looking for and it would be helpful, and we've asked others, and you are using different technology. So to the extent you can be helpful, we would appreciate it.", "18131 Is -- in your view, are mobile wireless -- you were here during the previous presentation -- do you think mobile wireless is also now at the point of being essential or perceived as essential by Canadians in terms of their telecommunication needs?", "18132 MR. BRAGG: I think if you ask those who don't have it, they're going to say yes. I mean, that's -- I was anticipating this question. I was thinking about it, because we operate in a sister business, some very rural farming operators that in the past, in my time, did not have cellular coverage. And I used to ask myself how on earth did we manage that before everybody had cellphones?", "18133 But, you know, one of the things we did do is we put our own sort of private radio network in so we had communication because there wasn't a cellular network then. Now there is, and that's taken the place of it.", "18134 So is it -- I mean, I think that's -- you know, what's essential? I mean, that's a really hard question to answer. I think it would be great if there were broader coverage, and you know, we're a cellular operator as well and we continue to build out our networks. But it's -- it comes back in my mind, it just comes back to a huge economic hurdle. And at what -- how valuable is it or how much are we willing to spend to solve that problem?", "18135 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, you might want to reflect on that as well in the next phases of comments because I think it is an issue that is, as well, squarely within this proceeding.", "18136 I note your comments on page 4 of your presentation, and you said:", "18137 \"While hydro is not within the CRTC's jurisdiction there are areas where the separate regulation allows for a shell game between hydro and telco...\"", "18138 It reminded me that as a lawyer at the CRTC, many, many years ago, when I used to do telecom regulation, I -- we had a case, and I had written for the commissioner -- the Commission, the decision about the importance of infrastructure being similar to the infrastructure required back in the 19", "th", " century to build out the railroad.", "18139 I remember defending the case in front of the Federal Court of Appeal, successfully. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court had a different view of things, and we are where we are.", "18140 But tell me more about separate regulations allowing for a shell game?", "18141 MS. MacDONALD: So support structures are a huge challenge for us, as you can appreciate from what we've said. Because of the joint use -- the joint ownership models that the hydro utilities have with the telco's there are processes, when we seek to attach to a pole, that appear to be quite duplicative.", "18142 So examples would be we can see make-ready costs that are as high as $4,000 per permit in some of our areas -- 2,000 for the telco, 2,000 for the utility. Because of the joint ownership, both are required to go out and do the work for the make-ready for various reasons.", "18143 In the charges, when we get them, we're seeing discrepancies in the charges from one to the other or a duplication of the charges just in terms of the time it takes to travel -- and we're talking rural areas as well, and so we're constantly looking at that.", "18144 And then on the ownership issue, we've run into some challenges with the actual number of poles owned by one party as compared to the other, and finding out at times that there was a transfer and we've been paying both parties for some of the same poles at times.", "18145 And so I think the point of that is, I'm not suggesting when we say shell game that it's intentional, by any means, it's just that the nature of the relationship between the two, and the processes for us to attach, allow for a lot of error, perhaps duplication of costs and significant time just managing that.", "18146 And oftentimes, because we're faced with a need to build and to get that permit approved, we're not in a position even to dispute it because if you dispute it you're not getting the permit. So most of the time, we're just eating that and saying, well, we have to move on, we have to keep building.", "18147 And so we wrote that into the ---", "18148 THE CHAIRPERSON: But you're eating but it gets passed on to the rates, does it not?", "18149 MS. MacDONALD: Well, it's increasing our rate for sure, yeah. Increasing our costs.", "18150 And we raised it because it's just one of those areas that I think really does require attention at some point in the future, especially as we're seeing exponential increases in hydro rates that look like they're coming and it's a real cost impact to us.", "18151 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "18152 On page -- but do you think \u2013 just on that, do you think that the -- I mean, you mentioned hydro but it's electrical utilities that have plant, sometimes they're not hydro so ---", "18153 MS. MacDONALD: That's right.", "18154 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- let's be neutral.", "18155 Would you think that they'd be willing to come to the table to ensure a coordinated deployment of broadband?", "18156 Because they do have a plan that is important. There's also conduits. There's Crown corporations that run electrical utilities of provincial jurisdiction.", "18157 I mean, others have called for more coordination because that's economically efficient, because you avoid making mistakes that -- and having to even rip up roads a second time. But it even is true for how we use poles for one purpose or some infrastructure for one purpose that could be used for another purpose.", "18158 Do you think that realistically, utilities, provincially regulated utilities would come to a federal table?", "18159 MR. BRAGG: No.", "18160 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay.", "18161 MS. MacDONALD: We would like them to in terms of support structure rates, though.", "18162 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, I appreciate that.", "18163 MR. BRAGG: They determine it and they call it the communication space ---", "18164 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "18165 MR. BRAGG: --- on the hydro poles. So I could argue you could make the case to take jurisdiction over that. I know, obviously, that's easier said than done.", "18166 But they're, you know, they're not that -- and their job is, whether they're regulated by a Utility and Review Board or how, is to protect their own ratepayers. So ---", "18167 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah.", "18168 MR. BRAGG: --- it's difficult for them to just decide to be, you know, at risk of any cost on their standpoint to further anybody else's goals.", "18169 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, and in all due respect to the Supreme Court, I'm not convinced they got it right because of the impact on the country from a policy perspective, but as a lawyer, I have to be respectful of their judgements, and there we go.", "18170 You mentioned on page 3, 10(c), you talk about -- and I'm quoting here:", "18171 \"...this may be even more important in...remote areas where capacity is restricted.\"", "18172 And you had a conversation and answered some questions for the vice-chair on this in terms of managing, and I think your point is that you still need some sort of ability to manage the network and/or a framework. And we do have a framework when it's a capacity issue that exists, but I take your point.", "18173 But I was wondering, could you expand -- are you making a point as well in terms of backhaul, or is it just access technology plan, or is it both when you talk about the particular challenge in remote areas?", "18174 MR. BRAGG: A backhaul, a little bit, but it's less of an issue. It's typically the access side of the network that is where your capacity demands are, and more so on a satellite or cellular or fixed wireless because just the nature of the architecture of how it's built. It's one tower, one site; a fixed amount of spectrum that you can use to deliver bits to your customers.", "18175 So that's where that shared architecture is more susceptible to, I'm going to say, overuse, but that's -- my point is a couple of big users chew up all the capacity on that network and you need to be able to manage around that.", "18176 Now, if you were to set a certain standard, I think that would -- you know, I think it might be all right, but it would tend to just go in. If we were, I'm going to say, bidding inside a subsidy regime to build or upgrade an area and it needed to be at 10 and 1 speed and you wanted to have a 50 gigabyte a month data cap, well that just all goes into the math about, well, all right, well how big do I have to build this network to support that; and therefore, how much subsidy do I need.", "18177 If it was 15 gig capacity per month, then you'd have to -- wouldn't need to spend as much money to build a network, so it just becomes an economic argument and it\u2019s like the size of the network.", "18178 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Appreciate that. I believe those are our questions. So thank you very much for your participation and look forward to reading your written arguments in the further phases. So thank you very much.", "18179 Why don\u2019t we take a short break until -- yeah, we were trying to do all this before a lunch break too. So why don\u2019t we take a shorter break until 11:25 and come back. Thanks.", "--- Upon recessing at 11:12 a.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 11:25 a.m.", "18180 THE CHAIRPERSON: \u00c0 l\u2019ordre s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.", "18181 Madame la Secr\u00e9taire.", "18182 LA SECR\u00c9TAIRE: Merci.

There was no business case to build a railroad to it. The canoe got you there, but it took weeks and could only carry light cargo, yet the government saw the long-term strategic value in funding the railroad. Today, Fort Brisebois is better known as Calgary.", "18185 Imagine if the two incumbents of the day, La Compagnie des 100 Associ\u00e9s and Hudson\u2019s Bay Corporation, had convinced the government that the canoes were more than enough. Keeping the served status allows incumbents to protect their territory from new entrants without having to invest.", "18186 If incumbents have no interest, then they should be sidelined and a focus moved to those who have an interest, namely, municipalities.", "18187 Vint Cerf has said that over 90 percent of Internet applications have yet to be invented. The needis to empower all Canadians to createnew applications, content and services, not just consume them.", "18188 The Commission cannot define basic Internet based on a fixed set of existing applications. Deciding which applications are need versus want would constitute undue discrimination against a declared want and against apps that have yet to be invented. ", "18189 What is done with packets is none of the Commission\u2019s business. Its business is to ensure Canadians have access to a network that carries packets quickly and efficiently to support growth in the digital economy.", "18190 Therefore, the needis to give all Canadians access to the Internet using the most modern technology applicable.", "18191 Quickly, for telephone, until an area is considered served with broadband, telephone should remain an obligation to serve, including dialup, paper directories and the blue pages.", "18192 And I have some comments about Bell raising its rates. I don\u2019t think they should be allowed to because that\u2019s a disincentive to invest in broadband. Keep the rates low so Bell can invest. Because once broadband is there, telephone\u2019s forborne.", "18193 For broadband there\u2019s been different -- a whole slew of different programs that have funded different -- based on geographical definitions that were incompatible and that leaves a lot of holes. This has to change.", "18194 What I recommend is the formation of basically NBN.ca. And I\u2019m sure you can find a better name to that. It needs to draw an accurate and complete census of areas needing broadband deployments. And areas would be defined by municipal boundaries or First Nations and special cases for unorganized territories.", "18195 The census results would be available online to any Canadian to check for the status of their town and complain if their home or town has not been identified.", "18196 NBN.ca would combine funding from NCF, federal programs and others, such as EORN, and coordinate with provinces to fund deployment of broadband based on bids for each projects.", "18197 It would also help each municipality to either find companies with expertise to build, or help the municipality build to deploy its own municipal broadband network. It would also coordinate the backhaul availability with each municipal project. ", "18198 It would also need to coordinate -- NBN would coordinate and champion spectrum availability. In other words, it would be the middle man to go Industry Canada to get the spectrum needed to do proper broadband in a town.", "18199 Projects should be funded by public private partnerships. No free grants.", "18200 NBA.ca [", "sic", "] would in charge of quality assurance to ensure the service is delivered as per standards. An ISP could buy back the PPP shares to become 100 percent owner. And those proceeds, NBN would then -- be available to NBN to fund more projects. Dividends would flow back to NBN.ca, which means an incumbent might have an advantage to buy back the shares.", "18201 Winning bidders below certain size would get either 5 or 10 years\u2019 guarantee that no incumbent would build. If the incumbent says we\u2019re not interested and someone else comes in, they need that protection to be able to go to the bank and say lend me money. There\u2019s no dangers from an incumbent.", "18202 And a deployed system that falls below standards during the term loses any protection from a new entrant.", "18203 Backhaul has been mentioned very often. It\u2019s become fairly obvious. There is one metric I wish to add. Currently in the south we\u2019re looking at about 1.2 gigabits a second of backhaul per 1,000 customers. This rises 32 percent per year according to a recent CRTC decision. ", "18204 And also, you have to look at population growth. And this allows you to project over 10 years what a bidder has to be able to provide in terms of backhaul. So you want to serve town X, you have -- that proposal has to have sufficient capacity in the backhaul for 10 years.", "18205 You may need to rate regulate the backhaul because in cases where only the incumbent is served and the incumbent doesn\u2019t win the bid to serve a town, the incumbent is not going to be very forthcoming in terms of offering lower rates.", "18206 And again, this was brought up, convincing provincial governments to open up their own private networks for use.", "18207 Satellites, well, they\u2019re always behind the capacity curve and will always be more expensive. They really are the solution of last resort. The goal is to move as many people from satellite to wireline to free capacity for those who absolutely need satellite.", "18208 Only a certain number of customers can be served by satellite without undue restrictions. Geographical standards, such as community size, distance from road, fibre trunk, et cetera, can be set to limit who has priority to access the satellite so the total number remains within the satellite\u2019s limit. In other words, if you want to have reasonable gig limits, lower the number of people on the satellite so that those who use satellite get proper usage.", "18209 If you lower the number of customers per satellite, it may become uneconomical for private enterprise and government may have to step in. Australia did as part of its NBN.", "18210 In terms of Telesat, you might have a consideration to provide CBB level rates, in other words, a subsidy for the backhaul so that towns -- ISPs in ", "18211 Iqaluit and stuff can provide decent service at normal prices.", "18212 For the last mile, there\u2019s a -- I\u2019ve listed a few scenarios. As the unserved, there\u2019s a partially served by one ISP and partially served by two or more ISPs. And basically, this is where the obligation to serve comes in because you have to use your powers to say to those who are already present in the town to finish the job, to complete the full footprint of the municipality.", "18213 Technologies should be able to serve everyone in a municipality, not just the core. So the full footprint. And everyone must be able to get the speed standard, the sync rate. No \u201cup to\u201d speeds. And doesn\u2019t prevent an ISP from offering higher or lower speeds. But if I want 25/10, I should be able to get 25/10, even if 5/1 is still offered.", "18214 There needs to be standards, and this was raised before, on oversubscription to make sure that we get decent service. This is particularly important for fixed wireless where they have limited amount of spectrum.", "18215 And when you evaluate bids, you should evaluate a long-term strategy because if you deploy fixed wireless and it only lasts two years and you have to deploy FTP three years later, you\u2019re wasting money with the first investment. So an eye to long term.", "18216 Basically, the major goal, make sure whatever is deployed is future proof. There\u2019s no point in deploying something you know is already outdated.", "18217 Aspirational speed, I will be bold and I will say 100 megabits download and 100 megabits per second upload. And you will see why next page.", "18218 Basically, this is incentive to choose today a technology that will evolve for at least 10 years. And proposals today who have a technology that can scale to that, get a boost in terms of bidding. In other words, they get ahead of someone who\u2019s cheaper, because their technology will last longer than a short-term solution.", "18219 My last -- targets now, a lot of people have done -- I\u2019ve done this very differently. A lot of people have said technology neutral, I've gone the opposite -- the actual opposite, I\u2019ve not put years, but I\u2019ve put technologies.", "18220 So basically, as of now, 8.1.1.1 eliminates ADSL1, and then it eliminates ADSL 2, and then it eliminates VDSL2, basically copper. And what's left are only technologies who can basically go forward in time. And also, this plan by having multiple steps, allows the ISPs to plan their investments.", "18221 Now, to come to my favourite topic, wiring the North. I've looked at a number of towns, and there's quite a few -- most of them are coastal. And I\u2019ve drawn a map very roughly of what is -- what's interesting in this is Canada\u2019s topology allows for redundancy in fibre, because you can have different fibres that go up and join at the top. And there's the Arctic Fibre Project as well from Quintillion.", "18222 Each community that\u2019s served with fibre reduces the need for capacity on the satellites, so that leaves capacity available for others.", "18223 A build would take many years to achieve, so it has to start now, because if we don\u2019t start now satellite capacity will become totally underwhelmed in the future. So we need to start replacing satellite as much as possible to limit to only the places where it\u2019s absolutely necessary.", "18224 A rough calculation on the back of a napkin, Whapmagoostui to Iqaluit is about 2,000 kilometres in the water, and a number that I found on the internet, roughly $40,000 per kilometre, it comes out 80 million. Now this is just one -- one thing with no landings.", "18225 Okay. And last, affordability. The Commission needs to declare that broadband is a basic access, basic service, before social services will even consider including it. So it\u2019s not you waiting for social services, it\u2019s social services waiting for you to declare it.", "18226 Neither the Commission nor the telcos have access to information to determine whether a person qualifies for help or not. So that really -- your goal is to set the standard and let the social services provide the subsidies where needed.", "18227 And another point too in closing, you also need to work to lower the cost of deployment. For instance, weaning yourself from satellites to reduce the actual costs so that the subsidies are less. So the more modern technology you use, the more efficient it is, the less it cost, the less of a subsidy you need. So that\u2019s I think a role that CRTC can play in terms of affordability.", "18228 And finally, for digital literacy, I would say that you can produce videos and distribute it to schools. MediaSmarts have had similar projects as well on that.", "18229 And on this, I will await your questions -- happily await your questions.", "18230 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. So I\u2019ll put you -- je vais vous mettre entre les mains de notre coll\u00e8gue, le conseiller MacDonald.", "18231 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good morning and thank you for being here from -- from Montreal today. ", "18232 I just want to start off -- I\u2019ve sort of divided my questions into three themes: what do we need to achieve; how do we coordinate to make it happen; and then how do we pay for it.", "18233 But I\u2019d like to start off -- I noticed in your earlier submissions you had suggested different speed targets than -- than what you're presenting here. You mentioned 5, 15, 20, 30, 50 megs as potential targets, and now you're suggesting, you know, up to a full 100 up, 100 down. And I\u2019m just wondering how you -- how you arrived at -- why you changed your thoughts and how you -- what your thought process was?", "18234 MR. MEZEI: Good question. This process lasted over a year, and during that time seeing the submissions and seeing what's happening, and even seeing the incumbents appear, especially Bell and Telus, have evolved my opinion on these things. And the speed targets I initially put was essentially a wish sort of -- you know, because nobody can predict the future itself. ", "18235 And when you guys came out on the first day -- when the Chairman came out with the need versus want, it made me realize I need to find some sort of justification for these speeds. And the speeds that I presented in the previous were -- you can't really justify, it\u2019s just, you know, a feeling, right. And where -- so what I\u2019ve decided here is what we really need to do is to stop deploying technology that has -- that\u2019s a dead-end. And you can\u2019t really do this overnight, because there's a lot of ADSL1 out in the terrain, a lot of ADSL2 and some VDSL2 that doesn\u2019t quite work. And you can't fix that overnight, especially when you have people who are not served.", "18236 So what I -- the reason I put that graph up was basically saying, \u201cOkay, the served status, you know, stop deploying today.\u201d But if you're below that, you still become underserved. And you know, it\u2019s only the second cycle where the 5/1 becomes unserved basically, totally, grossly insufficient. And so that\u2019s why I did sort of that graduated approach, because it gives time to invest.", "18237 And you know, Bell Canada in the interrogatories and even -- I think it was Telus, I'm not sure about Telus, who admitted basically they -- no, it was MTS who admitted they don\u2019t do 1 megabit even though they get grants, their technology can't do it. And I'm the victim of this because I\u2019m on FTTN and I can't do 1 megabit, I have 888 kilobits per second in a building that\u2019s certified to do 25/10.", "18238 And I can give you an example why 1 megabit isn't enough, for all the talk about these people, I did a Skype presentation to a bunch of university graduate students. And I prepared -- I\u2019ve got an old SD camera, because I can't do HD with 1 megabit, so I've got an old SD camera -- and all tested and I start to speak and stuff, and at one point I switched to present a slide, and it failed. Why? Because my screen is HD, so when I switched to present the sky -- to present the slide, Skype switched to AD, at which point the 888 wasn\u2019t enough.", "18239 So, you know, you hear all this bragging, the technology and the applications evolve. It used to be you could specify in Skype maximum throughput, it\u2019s gone, because Skype assumes everyone has modern broadband. And Canada\u2019s stuck with not so modern.", "18240 So that was sort of the impetus for me to draw these new speeds basically just above each technology, to make sure that they're not deployed anymore.", "18241 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And with respect to the five or the 10-year roll-in average or roll-in speed targets, are you advocating that we set the new speed targets and give people the full term, the full 10 years to catch up or meet those targets? Or are you suggesting that they gradually increase year over year? So next year we require 10 down, 1 up, and the year after that 15 down, 2 up until ---", "18242 MR. MEZEI: Well I ---", "18243 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: --- an end state of 100/100?", "18244 MR. MEZEI: In my chart I put year A, B, C and D because this is something that you're going to have to decide. If -- if you look for instance, areas that need to be served by fixed wireless, there\u2019s limitations in spectrum, there's limitations in physical deployment. They can't just fix this overnight, they have to be given time. So -- and that\u2019s why I have this now.", "18245 If there's a bid in a town, in a very distant community where none of the bidders come out with something that fix to serves, then there's a question that needs to be asked. Is less better than nothing, or should we actually find a solution that will work?", "18246 And again, it\u2019s a question of are you going to waste money on something that\u2019s going to have to be reinvested in a few years or not?", "18247 And so -- but if -- for instance if this year D were 15 years from now, then you\u2019d expect in 15 years that technology such as DOCSIS and -- obviously FTTP can do this today, and fixed wireless would be able to reach the 100/100.", "18248 And the other aspect of setting long-term goals is you allow the high-speeds to go their vendors and say, \u201cI will need fixed wireless to do 100/100 in 15 years, change your equipment because this is what we need.\u201d The same thing with the cable companies, they're currently limited in their upload by 42 megahertz repeaters in the coax, and this needs to be changed so they allow more upload capacity.", "18249 And so by giving this, you know -- and I specifically waited until Year B to raise the upload to 10, knowing the cable companies will need to do this. Now, I've been told it's a simple change. You just open the box, change our card, but for cable companies nothing is simple.", "18250 But this gives them a roadmap as to how to plan their plant upgrades for existing systems, but it's also a roadmap for any new system, saying you must now serve with these new speeds.", "18251 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And with -- just because I want to make sure that I understand how you've laid this out. You've broken it out into underserved, unserved, and served with different speed targets.", "18252 So are you suggesting that we would set different aspirational targets depending on where in the country we're actually talking about?", "18253 MR. MEZEI: No, I -- the aspirational target is 100/100, and that's something we should strive to get. And someone who installs technology today that can do 100/100 is blessed, essentially. You know, they get privileged access or priority in terms of the bidding process.", "18254 I think I may have forgotten to say this, but satellite needs to be treated separately because that will always be very specific to satellite. I would note, however, that even though Xplornet brags about 25/1, on the same satellite, the Viasat\u20111, in the U.S. EXEDE offers 12/3, which in my opinion, is far more interesting than 25/1 because there is that upload.", "18255 And that upload really isn't -- is something the incumbents have refused for years, despite demand from -- initially from geeks and now from everyone. Because you know, with the Cloud services, you take a picture and Apple wants to upload this to the iCloud right away, you know, and if you're at home, it's on your Wi\u2011Fi, which means you're wireline system.", "18256 There's a whole bunch of stuff being developed today that expects upload. And people want to create videos, they want to publish their photos in high resolution, not just, you know, these tiny pictures. This is what's coming, and the incumbents have really not pushed their vendors to up those upload speeds. Now, DOCSIS 3.1 allows great upload speeds but they need to change those 42 megahertz things.", "18257 And that's, really, why I want to -- I see your role as nudging technology. And if you look at 7(g) of the ", "Telecom Act", " about innovation, this is where your role is. You need to push the big, old companies to innovate; otherwise, to use my vernacular, they'll want to stick with the canoe, the 5/1 canoe.", "18258 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I'm looking at your -- the map that you provided, wire in the North.", "18259 MR. MEZEI: Yeah.", "18260 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And I'm going to venture out on a limb here and say I would be a very popular commissioner responsible for Nunavut if we were able to make this happen.", "18261 But we just heard from Eastlink, and they provided some very high level figures. It would be about $100 million just to build fibre to Nunavut, to say nothing about building it around the territory. They also spoke about challenges that they face with undersea cables elsewhere in the country. You know, it's amazing how easy it is for a fisherman to drop an anchor on underwater cables and the extreme work that goes into repairing those connections.", "18262 Do you think a plan like this would be feasible? And I know we're taking a longer-term view, we're not talking tomorrow here.", "18263 MR. MEZEI: Look, there's never going to be a business case to do this. You're never going to get Bell, or Telus, or Eastlink, or anyone to have a business case to do this.", "18264 Now, Quintela Networks, an American company, has already started to deploy in the western edge of Alaska. They want to do a cable between Japan and England over the Canadian Arctic, and in their plan, they want to connect some cities. And so that's one way to do this, and the fact that it hasn't been done yet probably means they're waiting for a business plan.", "18265 So there needs to be a vision. In the same way there's no business plan for the railroad, and the government built it 1800s, 1890s, there needs to be a business plan on this.", "18266 And you know, I'm reminded, I visited Resolute Bay a number of years ago and I learnt that Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord were artificial settlements. It was the Government of Canada who put -- who moved people up there to assert her sovereignty. And I think that all the people of Nunavut, and Northern Quebec, Labrador, and Northwest Territories, I think they deserve good broadband.", "18267 Now, unless you're willing to subsidize satellite forever -- and I should note, Australia with their NBN 2.0, as opposed to the NBN 1.0, was restricted only to only those people who absolutely needed satellites. NBN 2.0 under the new government, a city as large as Launceston in Tasmania is not going to be served by satellite because Turnbull doesn't want to build fibre to the town.", "18268 As a result, they've got so many people on satellite they've had to stop-sell, and they're building a third satellite that's going to be owned by the government, a third satellite to serve Australia because they don't want to deploy fibre anymore. So you have to look at that.", "18269 If you want to serve these people with satellite make sure you have enough capacity, because those plans, with the 10 gig, or 15, or 20 gigs per month is indicative that there is no capacity on the satellite. It can't serve people properly.", "18270 You know -- and so while I drew the map -- I had some fun yesterday because I was tired and I started to draw all the dots from all the towns and was trying to spell -- and Whapmagoostui I know because I met some people who went there. When I biked to Chisasibi, I knew about it because I crossed the road over LG\u20111, you can cross and there's a sign.", "18271 Whapmagoostui happens to be in Hudson's Bay, whereas Chisasibi is James Bay. And as a little trivia, there's a big difference because James Bay is very shallow; Hudson's Bay, it's deep. From an undersea cable point of view, deep is better. So Hudson's Bay is actually a bigger challenge than James Bay.", "18272 Now, if you look at all the communities -- as a matter of fact, maybe I shouldn't have drawn the lines because what impressed me were the number of communities in there. And I went over on the Nunavut Government website and I found the list of all the communities and the population.", "18273 Same thing from the Government of Quebec, the -- \u201cmarmot\u201d pointed me to a document where they have all the Northern Kativik communities, there's a lot of people there. You know, they need to be served.", "18274 And it's -- you know, it's obvious, a community of 30 people or a lodge in the middle of nowhere, that's going to be satellite. But a community of 1,200, do you really want satellite for that, you know.", "18275 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I don't ---", "18276 MR. MEZEI: And one last thing, to respond to your question. I drew all the lines but it's obvious this is going to be a -- if this happens, it's going to be progressive. So you might want to build to Iqaluit first, and that relieves you 2,300 homes or 7,000 people from the satellite, which is capacity others can use, and then you can move around this way bit by bit to serve more and more.", "18277 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So on the topic of capacity, because technology is a wonderful thing and it advances very quickly. And we've heard from a number of different intervenors, new technology that appears to be -- it appeared to be just at the cusp of being able to take advantage of it.", "18278 Be it Xplornet's new service -- new satellite services that will offer 25 down, 1 up. We heard from OneWeb a day or two ago, talking about lower satellites that are being deployed. We heard from another intervenor about high throughput satellites that are going to be deployed.", "18279 Do you think that that's a more viable option to service rural and remote Canadians? Understanding people do want wired infrastructure, but with these technological advancements is that going to solve the problem?", "18280 MR. MEZEI: Solve, no; help, yes. And as I said, satellite has a place. It is essential because there are communities -- areas where, you know, it just can't work. It -- you know, if you have 30 people in a community you can't really string fibre all the way there, unless there's community further up the road of 12,000 people, you know, then it works.", "18281 But satellite has a room, but you have to, I think, look a bit at the spin that you've gotten from the incumbents and Xplornet on this. They claim the satellite is going to be 20 gigabits of capacity. Now is this 20 gigabits in the uplink or 20 gigabits in each of the combs, the beams to each towns?", "18282 Because if it's 20 gigabits for the uplink, and the uplink serves the beam that serves Toronto, serves the beam that serve Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and maybe Northern Manitoba, then that's 20 gigabits for all of Canada, which means Nunavut only may get 5 gigabits because if they -- depending on how they allocate the stuff.", "18283 So you have to take all those claims with a little grain of salt.", "18284 Now, in the interrogatories, I asked Xplornet specifically about, for instance, fixed wireless and satellite technologies, and their response was, \u201cNot relevant to this proceeding.\u201d", "18285 So unless they come to you with hard facts of this is exactly how much capacity is going to be available to high Arctic on the East, how much it\u2019s going to be to the Arctic in the West, the Western Arctic, and how much it\u2019s going to be in the Northwest Territories, and so on and so forth, can you really bank on this? ", "18286 And OneWeb is very interesting. What I heard, it was -- their capacity was 6 Gigabits that they\u2019ve been given in terms of data throughput. But again, no mention of the uplink, and that\u2019s -- the satellite that\u2019s over Iqaluit has to talk to other satellites before it reaches the base station, and what\u2019s the capacity\u2026", "18287 I mean there\u2019s a whole lot of details you need to know before you can find out whether these future solutions will provide something you can bank on, you know.", "18288 And the only thing we know that we can bank on right now is fibre. You know, but satellite definitely will be there. And the example, OneWeb has a very interesting advantage. Because their satellites are constantly moving, someone -- I know the town of Field was mentioned. Field is right on the northern edge of a mountain range, the Kicking Horse Pass. It does not have view of satellites in the South.", "18289 But OneWeb satellites passing over will also move to the North. So they might have service from them.", "18290 So they have service -- they have internet from another like wire.", "18291 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yes.", "18292 MR. MEZEI: But I\u2019m just using that one as an example. ", "18293 So there\u2019s uses for satellites and they\u2019re necessary but what you have to do is not declare satellite as the solution. It really is the last resort for those who really need it.", "18294 And when you reduce the number of people who depend on it, then those who depend on it have enough capacity to have, let\u2019s say, 200 gigs a month of usage, and they actually get advertised speeds because the satellite is not congested.", "18295 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you for that.", "18296 With respect to coordinating efforts, you suggested the creation of a crown corporation NBN, and I\u2019m just wondering your thoughts on how that should be structured. You draw in from other similar crown corporations that have been structured in other countries?", "18297 MR. MEZEI: I looked at -- and a number of comments were raised already a bit in this proceeding in terms of the four-year cycles for elections.", "18298 You need -- this is a long-term project to wire Canada and so it needs to be able to operate fairly independently. Now, the CRTC is an independent administrative tribunal, although you\u2019ve admitted you touch sometimes, even though you\u2019re arm\u2019s-length, but you know you have that.", "18299 But are you the right organization to actually run this? And I think you\u2019d be the right organization to set the standards and set the procedures, the policy, but are you the right one to run this?", "18300 And I don\u2019t have a huge judgment on this, but I think that having a crown corporation, something that\u2019s separate, allows it to operate more based on logic and business sense than on political sense. So you know it\u2019s -- that\u2019s one of my goals.", "18301 The other aspect I looked at is I looked at the NBN in Australia, and a change of government wrecked it because essentially the new prime minister, while being in the opposition, argued against it. So once he got elected, he had to deliver on his promises. Essentially, that\u2019s the big picture of what happened.", "18302 And so that\u2019s a danger of having something that\u2019s tied too closely to the government.", "18303 And I think that the recent budget and the lack of mention of broadband in the election campaign of the current governing party is an opportunity because maybe we\u2019re working with a blank slate, and they are going to allow you to define. And I think that\u2019s an opportunity here to work on that.", "18304 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And how would this -- because there\u2019s a number of different stakeholders involved in whatever the solution is going to be. How would this crown corporation, how would its mandate be separate from the CRTC, separate from Industry Canada? ", "18305 How will it harness and bring all of those different stakeholders to the table, be they the service providers, the provinces, what have you, in a collaborative way?", "18306 MR. MEZEI: That\u2019s a big challenge; isn\u2019t it?", "18307 But if you look at a number of municipalities that have appeared in front of you who complained at how difficult it is to deal with Industry Canada, you know, you look at a company the size of Bell, they have, you know, I keep joking they have 10,000 regulatory lawyers. They know how to deal with all these things, but a small municipality who wants to deploy their own network, they don\u2019t.", "18308 And that\u2019s why I see NBN as being someone who will help deploy this, and it will actually do all the work of dealing with the government to get, you know, access to that 500 million, access to the funds from that, and NCF and the provinces as well. Because you know the provinces have -- because the Canadian government has lacked in leadership or has not been forthcoming early enough, provinces filled in the gaps and they strung their own fibres. And you\u2019ve heard that fibre is not really available, even though it\u2019s there.", "18309 NBN might be the organization that goes to the provincial governments and say, \u201clook, you know, we have people who are willing to use your fibre, and we have the solution to make it safe. We use different VLANs, we use different fibre strands or whatever but we can make it work.\u201d Same thing with what\u2019s been raised, dealing with hydros. Railways also, by the way, have fibre.", "18310 So that could be the champion that does all the work of the red tape on behalf of the ISPs and also combining -- being able -- and I know there\u2019s stacking rules but if you\u2019re able to combine funding from different parties, then you come out with a solution to serve -- I call it Saint-Profond-des-Creux, it\u2019s you know sort of a little village in Qu\u00e9bec that doesn\u2019t exist but it\u2019s out in the boondocks.", "18311 If you want to serve Saint-Profond-des-Creux, you need to find the backhaul and possibly, you know, get it from the government or possibly get it from someone else. You need to find an ISP or a builder who will actually install the stuff. ", "18312 So this NBN can be the resource that helps a municipality to get it done. And you know, the government seems to be more red-tapish in terms of, yes, you qualify; here\u2019s your money; go away and leave us alone. Whereas NBN, especially if it\u2019s a PPP, can be involved in helping move these things forward.", "18313 The goal is really to give broadband to the home, you know, not broadband to the press release.", "18314 And so that\u2019s why I seek a crown corporation being more independent from government in being able to -- its job. And you can give it a very strong mandate to do the job.", "18315 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And you sort of started to go down this road, so I\u2019ll bring you back to it, and it\u2019s with respect to the funding. I mean you mentioned P-3. So we\u2019re talking about companies being involved; we\u2019re talking about obviously governments being involved, and so forth.", "18316 Do you have any thoughts on how much funding should come from what body? I mean we have $500 million announced in the recent federal budget to go towards broadband. There\u2019s provincial initiatives underway as well. Service providers are investing. Some people have suggested a levy to be charged to internet rate payers to help fund builds.", "18317 Where should we be drawing all of this money from and to what degree should it come from one pocket versus another?", "18318 MR. MEZEI: I would say, as a citizen, draw from all of them because you\u2019re going to need it, because 500 million is not going to be enough. And for instance, in the case of the North, whether you launch another satellite or stretch a string of fibre, this would have to be a totally separate project funded by the government.", "18319 I don\u2019t think that ISPs should be funding that because that\u2019s really sort of a nation-building one.", "18320 But closer in the South, you have the NCF right now for telephone. That could be shifted, and it\u2019s been mentioned a number of times over, to help deploy broadband. You have the 500 million. Why not combine them?", "18321 And so when Saint-Profond-des-Creux wants their broadband, instead of getting 20 million from the government only, it might draw only 5 million from the government, 5 million from the NCF, and maybe 10 million from the province.", "18322 And I think the NBN company would be able to do these negotiations based on where that town is and a town in Ontario may have access to provincial funding that\u2019s not available in another province and vice versa.", "18323 So I don\u2019t think you can have a cookie-cutter approach to this, and you need an organization that has the knowledge to be able to basically manipulate through all this government opportunities and government, you know, difficulties as well.", "18324 So I can\u2019t give you a specific, you know, 50 percent there, 50 percent there. It could be the province -- for instance, in the project the province is more than willing to offer its fibre as backhaul. So the province ends up solving the backhaul and the rest of the funding only affects the last mile. In other cases, you know, the 500 million from the federal might go to the backhaul as well.", "18325 So I don\u2019t think you can or should fix specific targets as to percentage of fundings.", "18326 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just one final question before I hand you back over to my colleagues. And maybe you can only answer this question as an individual Canadian. But we\u2019ve seen studies, people when they\u2019re surveyed are very supportive of rates being similar across the country; they\u2019re very supportive of affordability measures; they\u2019re very supportive of increased speeds and more reliable service, but people also rank their priorities and sometimes we don\u2019t get a clear picture of that in some of the surveys that are done.", "18327 So if it\u2019s federal money that goes towards this it either means that that money doesn\u2019t go towards something else, national defense, building schools, whatever, or it means taxes go up. If service providers are providing funding that means they\u2019re not spending it somewhere else in their network, they\u2019re not returning profits to their shareholders, or they\u2019re increasing what they have to charge the end user.", "18328 So on that scale of priorities, where does access to broadband fit?", "18329 MR. MEZEI: If I look at the original call for the 134, notice of consultation, full participation in digital economy, one can argue that it\u2019s a national strategy to deploy broadband in order to deploy the economy.", "18330 As such, you could argue that it is a priority for the government, and I\u2019d say here government, federal, provincial and municipal, to deploy broadband, because that\u2019s how you grow your economy.", "18331 And as a cyclist, I\u2019ve gone through -- as a matter of fact, you\u2019ve seen the mayor from Sainte-Andr\u00e9 a few days ago. I\u2019ve seen that town lose their d\u00e9panneur. As a matter of fact, last year the Caisse populaire was for sale, the building. I\u2019ve seen the same in Ontario, Glen Robertson near the Quebec border, and they lost their d\u00e9panneur, and now the bar is a d\u00e9panneur, but they\u2019re for sale, because there\u2019s no other businesses in town, they\u2019ve all gone.", "18332 I\u2019ve seen this myself from a small footprint that I do on my bike over the years, and there needs to be action to provide economic growth in rural Canada. And right now there\u2019s a big opportunity because with digital, with broadband, anyone in Canada could come out with the next Google. And, you know, if you build it they may come but if you don\u2019t build it they will not come. So it\u2019s a risk the government has to take. ", "18333 And I think it\u2019s a priority, because if you look at the States -- if you look at the stock market in the States, the big companies they\u2019re all digital companies. This is where the growth is happening, and if Canada doesn\u2019t jump in then -- you know, you\u2019re going to have Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, maybe Winnipeg and Calgary and the rest is going to be just farmers begging to have access so they can plug their modern farming equipment in.", "18334 It\u2019s a national need, and so I think the government -- and the 500 million is great. Australia, the NBN 1.0, they set out -- ambitious project -- 30 billion. Five hundred (500) million compared to 30 billion. So which economies in the world are going to succeed in a digital age? And this is a question the government needs to ask.", "18335 And, you know, I\u2019ve seen the jaw dropping speed -- speech -- sorry -- from the Chairman of last week, and my jaw did drop, and he framed the problem very well, we need a digital strategy. And if the government is convinced that the digital economy needs broadband to grow that would be step one. That\u2019s a problem.", "18336 I don\u2019t know if that answers your question. I just ---", "18337 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: No, that\u2019s very helpful. And you\u2019ve cited building the railroad a couple of times today.", "18338 MR. MEZEI: Yeah.", "18339 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Another example would be building the TransCanada, which took about two decades to accomplish. So we may not be done yet but it does take some time to do these initiatives.", "18340 MR. MEZEI: I would say this very quickly, admitting the need, or admitting the problem is a big step in solving the problem.", "18341 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Thank you very much. Those are my questions.", "18342 THE CHAIRPERSON: I never thought our policies would be a 12-step program but I guess ---", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "18343 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- you\u2019ve opened that door.", "18344 It\u2019s also delightful to hear Quebec English spoken at our hearings, things like d\u00e9panneur instead of convenience stores but -- I understand autoroute is also widely used in English in Quebec. So it\u2019s a delightful m\u00e9tissage.", "18345 Just one question for you and it goes to page 3, and I guess it also builds on a question of language. You said that -- the fourth bullet there you say that Canadians have access to a network that carries packets quickly and efficiently. While you were putting down adverbs I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t add \u201cneutrally\u201d.", "18346 MR. MEZEI: Well, I know there\u2019s an ITMP hearing coming up. And yes, I probably edited the word out because I don\u2019t want to get into, you know, two hearings at the same time. But essentially, yes. And, you know, I had 27 too in the text but I removed it because I figured it would be maybe a little too obvious.", "18347 But essentially yes, the role of the internet is to deliver packets and it\u2019s up to the users of the internet to use it and exchange information. And the type of information -- and this is the beauty of the internet, is nobody -- you don\u2019t need to ask permission to send something to someone. Whatever that thing is, whether it\u2019s video or a document, you don\u2019t need permission. You don\u2019t need permission to start a new application. And this is where innovation really thrives. ", "18348 And if you start to define what\u2019s needed versus what\u2019s want you get into dangerous territory. And that\u2019s why when I saw the debate start with, you know, the incumbent saying that five/one is perfectly for email and stuff, email and stuff is not going to grow the economy.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "18349 MR. MEZEI: Innovating and finding a new application is what\u2019s going to grow the economy and to do that you need more than five/one.", "18350 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. Those are my questions. Wouldn\u2019t want to ask -- say anything that would cause more jaws to drop and cause injury to you. So appreciate it. Thank you very much.", "18351 MR. MEZEI: Thank you very much.", "18352 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: Madame la secr\u00e9taire?", "18353 THE SECRETARY: I would now ask Cybera to come to the presentation table.", "18354 When you\u2019re ready, please introduce yourself and your colleagues, and you have 10 minutes for your presentation.", "PRESENTATION ", "18355 DR. CARRA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Commissioners.", "18356 THE CHAIRPERSON: Are you getting product placement from Apple at least revenues?", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "18357 DR. CARRA: I\u2019ll turn it this way.", "18358 THE CHAIRPERSON: It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.", "18359 DR. CARRA: I\u2019ll begin by introducing our team. I\u2019m Barb Carra, Vice-President Policy and Strategic Initiatives. Beside me is Robin Winsor, our President and CEO of Cybera. And finally we have Alyssa Moore, our Policy and Strategy Analyst.", "18360 Over the past 20 years, Cybera has managed Alberta's advanced Research and Education Network. Our organization is strategically positioned as Alberta\u2019s technology neutral expert agency for the purpose of driving innovation for the economic benefit of the province.", "18361 One of Cybera's core roles is the expansion and operation of Alberta\u2019s Research Education Network called CyberaNet. This is the dedicated network for unmetered, public-sector traffic used by Alberta\u2019s schools, post-secondary institutions and business incubators.", "18362 Over the past two years, we have expanded our network to connect more academic researchers, industries, incubators, and government-funded partners than ever before. We now have 78 member institutions and our network connects over 600,000 end users.", "18363 We receive both provincial and federal funding to spearhead technology pilot projects that improve efficiencies and increase the competitiveness of Canadian institutions and businesses, but more and more our members are asking us for better, faster access to network and coordinated computing solutions. Broadband is being viewed as essential infrastructure and a driver of innovation, especially as the internet of things gives rise to new products, business models and new companies.", "18364 Based on our technology neutral, unbiased expertise, we are regularly consulted by academic institutions, local and provincial governments, and economic development authorities to help guide and advocate for critical technology infrastructure investments.", "18365 The conversation is shifting though. All across Alberta, small towns and larger municipalities are calling for connectivity to operate more efficiently, launch innovation opportunities, minimize the digital divide, and simply bring access to citizens who are underserved. They\u2019re asking for direction and they\u2019re asking for leadership", "18366 As such, the importance of this review cannot be understated. It represents a critical turning point for Canada's digital economy and communications landscape.", "18367 So I\u2019m going to pass it over to my colleague, Alyssa Moore, will now provide a synopsis of our written submission.", "18368 MS. MOORE: In our written submissions we state that broadband should be considered a basic telecommunications service, and should be affordable and accessible to all Canadians. ", "18369 To ensure that Canada is able to take the lead in tomorrow's marketplace of ideas and services, regulation is required to build and support our digital infrastructure. The reality is at that the present and in the future of communications in Canada is and will be conducted via an Internet connection.", "18370 Currently, not all Canadians have the affordable broadband connections required to use common Internet-enabled services and resources at a satisfactory level. It is a question of both price and availability.", "18371 The interventions made by private citizens directly on the notice of consultation, indirectly through various public interest groups, and the compelling presentations made by ACORN earlier in the hearing, reflect Canadians\u2019 frustration with their inability to meaningfully participate in the digital economy. ", "18372 This is especially true for Canadians living in rural and remote regions where barriers include poor availability due to lack of access infrastructure, poor quality due to lack of bandwidth and capacity, and poor pricing due to lack of competition or geographic remoteness.", "18373 When you ask the average Canadian what a reasonable data cap is or what speed they think is necessary to conduct basic activities online, few have the technical knowledge to pinpoint a number. They can, however, tell you when they are billed for exceeding their data caps with regular Internet usage or experience difficulty engaging with services involved in fulfilling common social and economic activities, including distance education, government services, teleconferencing, using cloud services, and uploading or downloading content.", "18374 To ensure that Canada is competitive in the global digital economy, the Commission should set both ambitious aspirational targets and mandate a level of basic broadband service. ", "18375 In our written submissions we said, \u201cAll Canadians will need the capability to transmit gigabits per second of data and process terabytes of information.\u201d While this scenario will not be the case tomorrow, we maintain that this is the future our communications infrastructure must be prepared to handle. New infrastructure builds must anticipate and accommodate future needs. This means scalability, flexibility, and shareability of networks.", "18376 Early in the hearing Commissioner Menzies stated that it will be helpful for the Commission to think in terms of the \u201cbasic, the no less than\u201d and \u201cideally as much as.\u201d ", "18377 It is our position that at the minimum a subsidy eligible basic broadband service should aim to match the FCC's National Broadband Plan target of 25 megabits per second down and three up. Ideally, Canadians would have affordable access to a symmetric gigabit connection.", "18378 Upload speeds must be taken into consideration because Canadians, and soon their numerous connected devices, are not only passive consumers of online content and services, but also active producers and participants. At the current 1 megabit per second standard, uploading a 10-minute iPhone video would take approximately 3 hours.", "18379 Data caps are a real concern for many Canadians. The Commission heard from ACORN and multiple small municipalities that users are limiting or censoring their Internet use for fear of exceeding their data caps. Ideally, all connections would be uncapped.", "18380 It is clear that market forces are not well suited to extend the infrastructure required to deliver a quality, affordable, basic service that is satisfactory for Canadians\u2019 Internet usage needs in many areas of the country. It is the nature of for-profit service providers to seek out profitable population centres and to actively avoid regions where it does not make business sense to operate. ", "18381 This is understandable from a business perspective, but has resulted in a manifestation of the digital divide known as \u201cthe donut hole\u201d or \u201ctimbit\u201d problem where a service provider hollows out the profitable business centre of a town, but does not extend their services to the less profitable premises on the edge of town and beyond.", "18382 Some interveners have submitted that it is the role of the government, rather than the CRTC, to fund the provision of broadband services where the market has failed. We agree that municipalities, provinces, territories, and the federal government have an important funding, granting, and planning role. For example, we support Bell's proposal to earmark a portion of federal spectrum auction revenues to finance broadband infrastructure deployment. However, the CRTC with its regulatory powers has the ability to take the lead by defining broadband as a basic service supported by a subsidy regime and signal to governments the importance of investment in broadband infrastructure.", "18383 And my colleague, Robin Winsor, would now like to speak to the Chairman's recent remarks on strategies to address gaps in connectivity.", "18384 MR. WINSOR: In addressing the Chairman\u2019s question as to gaps in connectivity, Cybera takes a holistic approach.", "18385 From the ground up, the layers of technology start with in-the-ground conduits carrying copper and fibre, to above ground services on utility poles, all the way up to the often underutilized fibre assets associated with optical groundwire on electrical transmission systems. ", "18386 Over the air connectivity starts at public Wi-Fi hotspots, fixed area wireless and cellular networks, all the way up to satellites 35,000 kilometres over the equator in geosynchronous orbit. Soon to be joined in this network of networks will be the low earth orbit satellites constantly flying by only a few hundred kilometres directly overhead.", "18387 This last element will surely be a key element in the technological side of filling the gaps, assuming the business and regulatory models allow it to do so. ", "18388 It's worth noting that the cost of launching one of these new low earth orbit systems, while certainly high at several billion dollars, is less than what the Government of Canada has already recouped from spectrum options.", "18389 But technology is not the only source of gaps in connectivity. Indeed, it may not be one at all if the new technologies discussed earlier by OneWeb come to fruition. ", "18390 The other elements are economics and expertise. Let's address those first and come back to technology later on. ", "18391 Often the technology is easy. It\u2019s changing the tone from a model of scarcity to a model of abundance that is difficult.", "18392 We have found that in many largely rural municipalities, elected officials need no convincing as to the value of broadband. The connectivity gap here is that they do not know how to get connected and are unlikely to be able to source the needed expertise locally. Without an economic incentive, the community will not be served by a TSP and so if it is to be served, it must arrange for both the expertise and the funds to connect itself. This is an area where the CRTC can help by making funds available through a subsidy program.", "18393 By allowing public organizations, in addition to ILECs, to access the subsidy funds you can empower communities to take care of themselves. In some cases, this may be a town council, a library, a band council or other not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to serve the public interest. ", "18394 Suitably funded, and especially when combined with the levers of control afforded by decision making authority over land use and rights of way, these bodies will be able to arrange backhaul and oversee the installation of appropriate distribution infrastructure.", "18395 CRTC cannot provide the expertise directly but you can empower a wider range of organizations through access to the subsidy. This may be the single most important step the Commission can take to close the gaps. Sometimes though there will be side effects.", "18396 The goal of telecom policy ought to be the empowerment of Canadians through ubiquitous access, not the protection of Canadian telecom providers. If a regulatory structure significantly improves access for the population but in doing so displaces an established Canadian business, then that is the right thing to do. Protectionism at the cost of connectivity cannot be justified.", "18397 This will come to the fore as global providers develop the technological reach to provide service into all parts of our country. While some companies, such as OneWeb, have said that they intend to work through TSPs as a wholesaler, what will the CRTC's stance be if SpaceX or another global provider were to provide service directly to every rural Canadian home?", "18398 The Chairman has asked who is in the best position to implement these strategies.", "18399 We would like to see the CRTC use its position of influence, if not its authority, to make all levels of government aware of the importance of broadband connectivity and to help change the lexicon. Too often we hear of government investment in infrastructure only to learn that the funds are going to bridges and roads. ", "18400 These create short-term employment, to be sure, but to truly build our 21st century digital economy, investment in infrastructure has to mean investment in digital networks. ", "18401 Leadership is needed. And while it ought to come from the government of the day, if it does not, then it should come from the CRTC.", "18402 Clearly, the CRTC has a major role to play, but we would like to see a coordinated approach between the various regulatory bodies to ensure the best use of fibre capable facilities, such as pipelines and high voltage transmission systems. ", "18403 Can the CRTC work with provincial regulators to improve access to underutilized assets and to require the installation of fibre, or at least the conduit for later use in open access networks as a condition of public access -- or of access to public lands?", "18404 Can the CRTC give guidance to cities and encourage them to work cooperatively with public interest groups trying to extend the infrastructure? While many municipalities, such as the City of Calgary, do indeed work cooperatively to build out municipal fibre for the public interest, many others still see it as a revenue opportunity and charge the same rate to schools and colleges as they do to for-profit telcos.", "18405 This would be a step in the right direction towards a National Broadband Strategy that affords all Canadians affordable access to an ever expanding terrestrial, aerial and orbital network.", "18406 Thank you for your time and we are happy to take questions.", "18407 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. I\u2019m not sure if it was wise referring to bits, bites and Timbits just before the lunch break, but we\u2019ll soldier on.", "18408 The Vice-Chair will start us off.", "18409 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Your written submission -- your oral submission was good too. Your written submission was -- I think I wrote it down -- very thorough, thoughtful, visionary and exhausting in the daunting challenge that it placed in front of us in terms of that. But I enjoyed it. And it did paint an image of the future. And it also inspired the thought, okay, so where do we begin in terms of that? Not that it hasn\u2019t already begun. And thanks for your thoughts on the broadband strategy and coordinating.", "18410 I have one question from that, which I should get out of the way. When you refer to the various regulatory bodies, in the previous conversation railways were brought up and now you mention pipelines, and last week we learned about hydro and -- or more about hydro, and that sort of stuff. Do you have a list or would you be willing to provide us with one of -- just of what you know of where fibre connectivity may be associated with different transportation and other corridors in the country?", "18411 MR. WINSOR: We\u2019d certainly be happy to work up the lists that we do have and provide those to the Commission. ", "18412 For example, we are currently working with utility providers in Alberta governed by the Alberta Utilities Commission through the Alberta Electric System Operators who have specified, for example, that all of the new high voltage transmission lines within the province carry a optical ground wire. So that is a 48 fibre bundle in the electrical protection at the top of the towers. Only two strands of which are actually required for their operation of the electrical system, leaving 46 as they use the entertaining term a \u201cstranded asset.\u201d We would like to get at those strands of the stranded asset and think it should be deployed in the public interest.", "18413 So we\u2019re in those discussions just now and we\u2019d be happy to share that information with the Commission.", "18414 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. I think our undertaking date is May the 5", "th", ", if you\u2019ll take it as an undertaking.", "18415 ", " UNDERTAKING ", "18416 DR. CARRA: I would just ask that if we get a few extra days would be useful for us to put that information together.", "18417 THE CHAIRPERSON: How many -- what\u2019s a few extra days?", "18418 DR. CARRA: If we could -- to the following Monday. Is that the 8", "th", "? I don\u2019t know. Sorry. 9", "th", "?", "18419 THE CHAIRPERSON: 9", "th", "?", "18420 DR. CARRA: Thank you.", "18421 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. So the 9", "th", "?", "18422 DR. CARRA: If we could get until after the -- it\u2019d be great.", "18423 THE CHAIRPERSON: Sure.", "18424 DR. CARRA: We have a board meeting that\u2019s going to take up our time.", "18425 THE CHAIRPERSON: I think since you\u2019re late in the proceeding that seems fair.", "18426 DR. CARRA: Thank you. ", "18427 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I\u2019m going to start with your outlining of the need for symmetrical download and upload speeds. We\u2019ve discussed that a bit with industry and they find it very daunting and haven\u2019t been able to put a price on it, but certainly referred to as extremely expensive.", "18428 Can you point us to other jurisdictions where -- with similar infrastructure where symmetrical high speeds are available?", "18429 MS. MOORE: So I don\u2019t even think that I need to point towards another jurisdiction actually. We had Axia FibreNet in a few days ago in front of you and they are deploying symmetrical fibre services to rural communities in Alberta. So that\u2019s definitely something that could be looked into. And I\u2019m not sure if they put that on the record, but I\u2019m aware that\u2019s happening.", "18430 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Do you know what the speeds are?", "18431 MS. MOORE: I am not aware, but it\u2019s certainly information that would be available through Axia\u2019s website, if I\u2019m not mistaken. But I can undertake to try and find that out as well.", "18432 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want to give you another undertaking. It\u2019s -- you just -- you provided the first breadcrumb and we\u2019ll follow it ---", "18433 MS. MOORE: But I believe it\u2019s somewhere in the neighbourhood of 50/50, if I remember correctly.", "18434 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "18435 MS. MOORE: It\u2019s not insignificant.", "18436 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.", "18437 So you also referred to the Connecting Canadians target. I think -- I\u2019m not -- it\u2019s a chicken and egg. I think that emerged from our 2011 target. Yeah, anyway, and we\u2019re moving forward with another target. Would you agree that it would be wise for some synchronicity in those targets in terms of that?", "18438 DR. CARRA: I was just going to say I think, yeah, absolutely. I think it\u2019s really important we see better coordination across all these initiatives that come out there. We often hear about opportunities through Digital 150 or the things that come out from the federal government, at least at the provincial level. And then when you chat with our provincial level folks, there\u2019s a disconnect between understanding how that\u2019s happening at that level, and then how to make use of that at the provincial level, and then even further down the stack with our municipal partners.", "18439 So I think if there was a more holistic and coordinated approach around these different initiatives, including Connecting Canadians and ever -- whatever future strategies come out, it would be really useful.", "18440 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: True. How do you interact with municipalities?", "18441 DR. CARRA: We work really closely with the big cities. So City of Edmonton, City of Calgary on, you know, fibre initiatives within the cities, mostly to connect our public sector members. Finding out a, either how can we leverage the fibre they\u2019re investing in their infrastructure as a not-for-profit user, but also, with the City of Edmonton we\u2019ve actually been working on building an actual fibre and putting fibre in the ground as a partner with the City of Edmonton to connect some of the institutions that haven\u2019t been able to make appropriate use of SuperNet or other sources in the environment to get better capacity at an affordable rate.", "18442 We also work with the smaller municipalities on strategy around how do they improve their broadband capacity in their communities, looking at different models for moving forward and how can they get better access to the bigger centres for shared initiatives.", "18443 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Is there a lot -- that\u2019s just reminded me of another thing. There\u2019s municipal fibre everywhere too, right, that is used exclusively.", "18444 MR. WINSOR: There\u2019s a considerable amount of municipal fibre. At a meeting some time ago when we first looked at the City of Calgary\u2019s municipal fibre map, I mistakenly thought I was looking at a street map of the city. It\u2019s very dense. And City of Calgary has taken the attitude that this is to be deployed in the public interest. They are not trying to make money off it. They regard it very much as part of the City\u2019s infrastructure, much as the roads and everything else. So they\u2019re absolutely terrific partners in making sure that we can connect all the various parts of the city.", "18445 Some other jurisdictions do treat that as something that they would like to recoup the cost on. But our argument tends to be you built it for your own purposes or you laid it at a time when you had the road dug up anyway. That makes it available and it\u2019s just part of using the city\u2019s infrastructure. Unless we\u2019re about to go to toll roads everywhere and so on and charge for every bridge and tunnel, we shouldn\u2019t do the same for municipal fibre.", "18446 So guidance from CRTC that whenever public institutions dig up the ground that they put in the capabilities of the fibre. Because the fibre is not expensive. It\u2019s in placing it that\u2019s the problem.", "18447 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Does the City provide service providers access to its fibre network?", "18448 MR. WINSOR: They do.", "18449 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "18450 MR. WINSOR: They ---", "18451 DR. CARRA: I was just going to say the cities tend to operate under different business models though. And that\u2019s an educational piece as much as it\u2019s sometimes changing attitude toward how can we better improve those relationships.", "18452 Honestly, the City of Calgary is very progressive in their business model and view opportunities as partnerships in terms of improving public sector connectivity. You know, some of the other cities haven\u2019t quite come as far down that business model approach and still are more proprietary over the investment in the ground. And it\u2019s a harder business model sometimes to crack.", "18453 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. When we talk about a target of -- you talk about a target of 25. Is -- and you sort of talked about the Timbit or the donut hole -- sorry to bring that up before lunch again, but the -- isn\u2019t there a risk that that just makes that divide larger? I mean, if you said 25, all of a sudden that the ISPs -- again, you\u2019d just see -- you would likely just see a repetition of the previous economic pattern. And concern people might raise is that that's just going to grow that divide and result in more social tension and more depopulation of towns and municipalities and that regional districts that don't have that level of connectivity. Could you address that, how we would get around that, or mitigate?", "18454 MR. WINSOR: I'm not sure that you can mitigate that consequence of setting reasonable targets and having people feel that they are disenfranchised when they don't get that service. The pressure, however, from the public to build will grow as the targets rise and as the imbalance becomes ever more apparent.", "18455 Although it's not something that we really need to add a lot of pressure to just now. Rural users are already feeling greatly disadvantaged relative to the people who are either in the cities or in the middle of small towns, where quite often there is service. There is a big difference between the Timbit and the donut. Again, apologies.", "18456 But raising the target should not be something that you hold back on just because it's going to make those who aren't getting what they should more dissatisfied. If anything, it'll help to add the weight of the public voice to saying we must build this, and as innovative new technologies come along that will add pressure to the providers to bring it in.", "18457 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you.", "18458 In your written submission, you suggest that we regulate in terms of the following: speed, competitive access, oversight, affordability, and latency.", "18459 So first of all, what should be the latency standard we set should we choose to set one?", "18460 MR. WINSOR: Less than or equal to 64 milliseconds.", "18461 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sorry?", "18462 MR. WINSOR: Less than or equal to 64 milliseconds.", "18463 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Sixty-four (64)? Thanks.", "18464 And you also -- you mentioned in your updated and in your presentation here in terms of, I think you said ideally there would -- data caps would become a thing of the past, but I don't think they will real -- right away.", "18465 So where would we start in terms of what you would consider to be a minimum capacity for a standard?", "18466 MR. WINSOR: We firmly believe those data caps should go. We operate the Research and Education Network, which is not the Internet but still connects a great deal of researchers, universities. And there's a counterpart to Cybera in each of the provinces, some large, some small, but -- and then our federal counterpart's CANARIE. That Research and Education Network runs without camps because that's how you get people to use it most effectively.", "18467 Because of the fact that our service levels are designed to give maximum use of the network, what we do when we do have to do any sort of metering at all -- and we've collected a lot of users together to form Internet buying groups, aggregating demand and moving it forward.", "18468 So if a schoolboard wants a 50-megabit or 100-megabit service, we'll make sure that they get that, but we put no immediate prevention on bursts and we don't cap the actual amount moved. Because in our view, if we say that we're going to provide a 50-megabit or 100-megabit service, then you should always get a least 50 or 100 megabit. That would be the floor.", "18469 And then if people want to burst to a gigabit, as long as they're not stepping on somebody else at that very moment, that's great because we'd like to fill the pipe. And when the pipe fills, we get a bigger pipe and we handle the economics from there.", "18470 That leads to unfettered use of the resource. The last thing we want is somebody saying, well, I'm near my limit; I better not do this or that. That's absolutely anathema to the research mentality, and I believe the same is true of innovators wherever they may be. They're not necessarily on campus. They can be on farms, in homes, you name it. The camps need to go.", "18471 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, but we've heard several intervenors, including most recently Mr. Bragg, mention that, I mean, they use that to manage their capacity, right. And certainly, they could increase the capacity because, I mean, if there are no -- we take them at their word on that, that if they're not managing their capacity people get a much less pleasurable experience with their Internet connection. And then they have to invest in the capacity and they have to recoup that investment and everyone's Internet bills go up, or they lay some people off, or something or other happens.", "18472 So are you aware of that difficulty in that sense, and how you -- I mean, there's one thing is creating the system. The other thing is, I mean, as many have mentioned previously, the ", "Telecom Act", " says it has to be affordable. So help me with that.", "18473 MS. MOORE: So we're certainly aware of data caps as a method of management. However, it's an artificial limiter to impose upon end users.", "18474 Bits are not a limited resource. There are other methods of managing capacity, other traffic management methods that do not encompass data caps. Because data caps disincentive use across the entire billing period, where what really is required to happen is disincentivizing use at peak periods where congestion is happening and capacity is being breached.", "18475 So it's -- we just find that it's an incredibly artificial method of managing traffic and there are better ways to do it.", "18476 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "18477 In your submissions there, you noted that we regulate price in the Northwestel serving area, and you encouraged us to do more of that. But you also sort of insist that we regulate for competitor access, which we do, and I found that -- I was trying to square the two.", "18478 Because if there is a competitive environment in terms of that, doesn't that regulate price? By giving -- I mean, if you have choice and you have competition, that should regulate the price, and at least from a self-serving point of view, people can blame price on their service provider and not on the CRTC. But more broadly, it just seems to be odd. That usually you would regulate price because of the lack of competitor -- competitive pressure.", "18479 So how do you want us to do both across that?", "18480 MR. WINSOR: If economic theory were to be believed, then once we've got sufficient competition you wouldn't need to regulate. But I think a big part of the challenge before the CRTC on an ongoing basis is getting real competition. We have not seen the limited number of large carriers effectively producing the competition that we would like to see.", "18481 As an example, when we first looked at Internet pricing in Alberta, not even way up North, we saw that some post secondary's were paying 200 times the American rate. As soon as we aggregated that demand and setup a truly competitive system, where there was a large amount of demand and there was the opportunity for one carrier or another to displace the others from the various major universities and colleges, the price dropped by a factor of 10 overnight.", "18482 That suggests that the competitive system was not working very well before.", "18483 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: True, but it might suggest that by you taking the action you did the competitive system worked.", "18484 MR. WINSOR: Yes, but it needed help ---", "18485 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah.", "18486 MR. WINSOR: --- and we hope that you will help it also.", "18487 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, but ingenuity was involved. Okay, I understand where you're coming from.", "18488 Explain why service-based competition is better than facility-based competition, which you make that point. But facilities-based competition has long been the policy of the Government of Canada. So why is it wrong?", "18489 MR. WINSOR: We think this gets back to the questions, again, of scarcity and abundance. The capacity of fibre trunks is tremendous. On a single pair of fibres, you can run 88\u2011100 gigabit circuits. A bundle will typically have 144 fibres. So the ability once you can get access to a fibre trunk is tremendous.", "18490 Now, history is filled with people who said nobody will ever need more than X. Bill Gates said nobody\u2019s ever going to need more than 650 -- 640 kilobits of memory. The initial market for computers was three for the world. ", "18491 Those -- I don\u2019t want to be one of the people saying nobody\u2019s ever going to need more than this and be laughed at 10 years from now or maybe 5; things are changing faster. We have to build futureproof.", "18492 But there is tremendous capacity on a fibre trunk and to have four or five of them deployed exactly in parallel with each other seems terribly wasteful in a country with sparse population and costs that are generally agreed to be too high. ", "18493 There\u2019s fibre in various places that we\u2019re not using, such as the optical ground wires. We have -- I have a photograph that I like to show people of myself standing next to five fibre trunks all in the same ditch outside a small town in Alberta. ", "18494 Clearly you don\u2019t want to have all your eggs in one basket. There has to be redundancy and resiliency in the system, but duplicating infrastructure everywhere is problematic. ", "18495 It\u2019s also problematic within the cities. If you look at City of Calgary they\u2019re desperately trying to make sure that all the carriers don\u2019t dig up the same road time, after time, after time, to put parallel resources in.", "18496 And even though the city\u2019s infrastructure is repaired to a required standard, you know that that roadway is going to crumble many, many years before it would otherwise if it had only been dug up once then we could at least have shared a conduit, if not the actual fibre. ", "18497 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. ", "18498 And maybe this segues into your quoting of Tim Woo in your submission. The view that it\u2019s obvious in his view that broadband is a public utility. ", "18499 So how do you see that image as different from a largely private enterprise network regulated in the public interest by people like us?", "18500 MR. WINSOR: Apparently not a popular one to answer. ", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "18501 MR. WINSOR: The idea of public utility is, I think, basic and it comes through in all the statements that we see from you at the CRTC. ", "18502 It\u2019s more and more how people think of access to broadband and whether it\u2019s from a tightly regulated corporation that is following the rules in the public interest or whether it is actually built as a utility without a for-profit motive is somewhat immaterial, as long as the regulation and regulatory environment is strong. ", "18503 But we\u2019ve certainly seen that it is not in the nature of corporations without strong regulation to behave in the public interest. ", "18504 They have their shareholders, they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re supposed to do, but this is too vital a resource to leave to simple competitive pressures from very large corporations and we\u2019re strongly in favour of strong regulation. ", "18505 DR. CARRA: I would add to that just a little bit. ", "18506 In Alberta at least every time we go to a provincial meeting and we talk about the fibre opportunities in the province, we constantly have to re-educate to some extent to and make clear that there are these models in the ground for these reasons.", "18507 But there are also these other approaches and resources that they think if these things come online then we don\u2019t need fibre in the ground anymore. ", "18508 We sometimes get that question. Oh if you access satellites or satellites come online we\u2019re not going to need the SuperNet anymore or we\u2019re not going to need this.", "18509 And painting that complete picture from ground all the way up we find that all these models have a role in the space creating that complete picture.", "18510 So while the SuperNet might not go everywhere and you need wireless -- or you know the end points to connect to the communities and you need satellite to service the underserviced areas.", "18511 They tend to not realize that there\u2019s all these pieces that build the complete picture and they tend to just focus on one.", "18512 And I think a big part of that is educating that all these different approaches have a role if they\u2019re coordinated better and more properly. ", "18513 So from SuperNet to private sector, you know, fibre deployments to satellites coming online, they\u2019re all going to build that system, including if we can access the transmission fibre or every time they put a pipeline in the ground let\u2019s lay the conduit for more fibre. Why not? ", "18514 It\u2019ll -- every pipeline that goes through every small community across this country can bring fibre to the small communities. ", "18515 Like those are opportunities that we\u2019re not tapping into and I think would paint a better picture for Canada. ", "18516 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: That might be a sales pitch somebody uses for pipelines at some time. ", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "18517 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I don\u2019t blame you. But I\u2019m not that regulator. The -- sort of seguing onto again to looking at other jurisdictions, we often get examples -- and I will pick on you mildly here, to look at and I know that you\u2019re sensitive to Canada\u2019s geographical challenges. ", "18518 You used an example in paragraph 55 of investment and return on investment by the U.K. Government and I tend to react when I look at those -- and you can dispossess me of why -- of this impulse. ", "18519 I look at that and I understand that the entire United Kingdom fits into 40 percent of Alberta and it has 16 times as many people.", "18520 And I -- you know, when we go through this and I look at that and I\u2019m trying to say how is that supposed to make any sense to me; right?", "18521 Where if somebody says why can\u2019t we be like Singapore or Estonia or something. I mean Calgary is the size of Singapore; right?", "18522 Point me to a model that I can relate to or use -- relate this model to me, if you would, please?", "18523 MR. WINSOR: Pretty clearly the -- you\u2019re absolutely correct about the U.K. being a very different situation. ", "18524 Although I would point out as a Scotsman, who\u2019s been in Canada for 34 years, that Scotland\u2019s about the same size as England and its only got one tenth of the population. So the ratios are about the same between Scotland in England as Canada and the States.", "18525 But anyway, that little aside, we have Hadrian\u2019s Wall to keep the English out. ", "18526 The analog that we tend to go to is Australia. Unfortunate as the previous presentation pointed out, that by going back and forth politically they haven\u2019t built out their national broadband network in the way that they would have hoped to.", "18527 But population density, the fact that a lot of it is concentrated along the coast, those are reasonable analogs to the Canadian situation.", "18528 But we are unique. We have a massive geography. We have tiny population density compared to those other places. ", "18529 So yes we point out what\u2019s happening in the U.K., we point out what\u2019s happening in others, because Canadians will compare themselves to their friends in the U.K. or in the States, or in Australia. ", "18530 They speak more to the aspirations for connectivity then they do the absolute economics of Canada, which is after all quite special.", "18531 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you. Because I\u2019m -- feel free to call me Magnus(Ph) if you want, but the ---", "18532 MR. WINSOR: I have been tempted.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "18533 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The -- where it comes in is with the economics there. I mean the cost per capita and the return and that sort of stuff, but thank you for addressing it and being patient with me anyway.", "18534 Now you speak fairly generally about subsidies and I just want to be clear where you\u2019re talking about where you think subsidies should apply and whether you\u2019re differentiating there between subsidies and some like -- some of -- and funding. ", "18535 And some of the discussions we\u2019ve had recently have begun to focus more -- and more recently have focused more on the need to fund transport and I -- so are you talking subsidy and funds separately or all together?", "18536 MS. MOORE: I think we\u2019re talking separately. So when we -- when we say \u201csubsidy\u201d we mean an industry subsidy analogous to the national contribution fund.", "18537 And when we say funding or granting, we are talking about provincial, or municipal, or territorial, federal government funding or granting.", "18538 And so in Alberta the example has come up time and time again of the SuperNet, that is a transport, for the most, part that is funded in part by the Provincial Government, where a subsidy, I think, we\u2019ve discussed would apply to more the last mile. ", "18539 If that can be coordinate certainly that is the goal here in terms of a national broadband plan, but there\u2019s a place for all of these contribution mechanisms.", "18540 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Do you think that -- do you agree with others who may have heard today too that transport is the preferred target for funding?", "18541 MS. MOORE: We\u2019re going to say no, because again, there\u2019s been lots said about the SuperNet, and there seems to be this rosy view that Alberta is covered and that there is nobody struggling in Alberta, and we\u2019re this wonderful utopia with the SuperNet, but that\u2019s not the case.", "18542 Yes, we have the transport into the points of presence and the meet-me\u2019s and the communities, but that, in many cases, does not -- or has not translated into service levels for the end users for the last mile. So there is certainly need for the last mile to be subsidized and funded as well.", "18543 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I\u2019m slightly saddened to hear that Alberta is not utopia. ", "18544 But perhaps for the benefit of others ---", "18545 MS. MOORE: It\u2019s close.", "18546 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- the -- I mean, the broadband map, the connectivity map that\u2019s out certainly shows Alberta more geographically covered than any other jurisdiction, although I expect PEI probably looks pretty good if you could pick it out, but the -- no? Okay.", "18547 MS. MOORE: Which is wonderful ---", "18548 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: See, I shouldn\u2019t make assumptions. But help -- for others, explain why that look at Alberta is not what they may assume it to be.", "18549 MS. MOORE: So I think Dr. McNally from the University of Alberta spoke to the Van Horne Institute\u2019s a little bit earlier in the hearing. And so Van Horne hosts a meeting a couple of times a year called the Digital Futures, and that\u2019s where we pull together a bunch of community leaders, we\u2019ve got reeves and mayors of small towns, and interested parties who really want to get community broadband or at least get their constituents served by TSPs because it\u2019s not happening at least to sufficient service levels. ", "18550 So where we see in this broadband map all these hexagons are covered in Alberta and in many cases those are people who are only getting 1.5 megabit per second speeds from a wisp and in the best case scenario when the connects aren\u2019t saturated by numerous end users. So a lot of those numbers are best case scenarios and don\u2019t reflect the actual service levels obtained by people in their homes. ", "18551 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I just have a couple more questions I think. But I think the larger one that comes together with this as we go through and sort of when you talk about -- you create a number of funding options you put out in front us and -- like the universal service fund in the States for instance.", "18552 Now, a Canadian equivalent to that I think would be about $1.5 billion a year roughly. I think, they -- maybe a little less than that but roughly there. And I was trying to figure out the affordability of that and I was thinking 14 -- okay, 14 million households, 1.5 billion, that\u2019s about $100 a year, right. So -- or a little more than that. ", "18553 And I was trying to figure that again how we come out of this when we\u2019ve got all these affordability issues in front of us trying to explain at the end of the day to Canadians we\u2019ve created this new fund, and we\u2019re very visionary, and your internet bill is going to go up after taxes by $10 a month. I was going to ask where do you think they\u2019d hold the parade for us but it was more like how do we manage that interface. ", "18554 I mean, how do we manage these -- and your ambitions are laudable and that sort of stuff, but we do have these other obligations in terms of that. So what are our options, suggesting -- I mean, apart from coordination and that sort of stuff. If you put yourself in our shoes for a minute and where do we begin to solve that problem?", "18555 MR. WINSOR: I think one of the things that you\u2019ve been hearing through the course of the hearings has been that Canadians care deeply about getting connected. And if you told everybody in the country that they were going to pay $10 more many in the city might not be terribly happy but I don\u2019t think they would argue a lot in terms of the value they\u2019re receiving. ", "18556 If in doing so, they could talk not only to their friends in the city but also that situation meant that they could also connect cleanly and affectively to all their cousins in the countryside as well, then I think that we would say that we had done a very, very good job and I would be happy to be out in the parade.", "18557 The importance of this is it\u2019s hard to underestimate just how important this is. The Chairman in his mid-hearing remarks pointed out that this is a chance to get it right. It matters. It matters a lot. It doesn\u2019t just matter to those of us who are kind of the geeks that care more about the technology. It\u2019s an everyday part of life. And don\u2019t underestimate how much people care about getting that connectivity.", "18558 So if the cost to build out and fix a lot of the connectivity problems that we have just now was one and a half billion that added certain amounts, what is the cost for an interchange in the city that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. ", "18559 I mean, when infrastructure is talked about by our new federal government, I keep on waiting for them to say \u201cand this means large investment in digital infrastructure\u201d but it tends to mean physical infrastructure. And sure, if some of that physical infrastructure is crumbling than that is somewhere where we have to spend money on public safety, but these networks are also public safety aspects.", "18560 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I\u2019m reminded of the extension of the Dempster Highway to Tuktoyaktuk in terms of choices.", "18561 Last thing is we have all of these issues in front of us that we\u2019ve identified. How would we triage them? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re not capable of multi-tasking. But if this is an emergency room and all these problems have arrived in it, who gets to see the doctor first? ", "18562 MR. WINSOR: I suspect my colleague\u2019s going to want jump in on this one as well. But I think one of the first places that you can do is empower community broadband. ", "18563 There\u2019s so many small communities that we talk to in Alberta who are ready to do something to get better connectivity and simply cannot attract the attention of the incumbents at the levels that they want. They want to do community broadband. They don\u2019t know how. They haven\u2019t got the funds. They need help. ", "18564 Folks like Van Horne Institute who are trying to establish some sort of a playbook that says this is how you go about it are certainly helping but guidance from the CRTC, access to subsidies to help them build out and achieve community broadband is one of the things that I think that you can do first to stop the bleeding in that triage situation. ", "18565 I think you should be looking on the longer term very, very closely at what\u2019s happening with the new technologies, especially the lower earth orbiting satellites. Obviously that\u2019s a bit further out and the launches are only starting next year but it\u2019s going to be a big part of the picture if you do this again a few years from now. ", "18566 So somewhere between those two, but it\u2019s certainly starts with helping the community broadband efforts.", "18567 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you very much. I enjoyed your intervention and your presentation.", "18568 I\u2019ll turn it back over to others now.", "18569 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "18570 Commissioner Vennard?", "18571 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Hello. I enjoyed your presentation too, as well as your written submission.", "18572 I just wanted to make a couple of comments that I think are really quite important and then pose a question to you.", "18573 The first comment that I want to make is just with respect to the SuperNet. And the SuperNet never was designed to deliver connectivity to peoples\u2019 homes it was a provincial initiative to deliver one point of presence to 424 rural and remote communities not to every home.", "18574 So if the people are not getting -- and I know that there are all sorts of issues -- I\u2019m the Commissioner for Alberta, so I know there are all sorts of issues with respect to getting every single person in every single community, but that never was something that the SuperNet itself and the province took on.", "18575 So I think it really speaks to something that you wrote about all through your submission, and we\u2019ve heard it before, certainly in -- as our hearings have progressed, and that\u2019s the idea of the structural separation from the services. ", "18576 Now, there\u2019s obviously got to be some structure to get out to a home too. But it also falls in that same kind of category there, so -- I did work on the SuperNet right from the beginning, right -- way back in 2000, and it was a project that was ahead of its time, and it failed on many levels and wildly succeeded on many other levels too. So I don\u2019t think we can really classify it as something that was a resounding success, but neither was it a dismal failure, it's somewhere in the middle. And it's very, very right for lessons learned, because some elements of it I think worked really well, some less so.", "18577 So having said that, I just wanted to sort of put that on there for the record that it, you know, I didn\u2019t want that to be sort of the last word on SuperNet, that it -- that the people weren\u2019t happy with it. One of the issues with it is the connectivity fees that actually get onto the SuperNet, which is something that we don\u2019t regulate, and that\u2019s something that has to be negotiated. ", "18578 In your written submission you identified many of these sort of areas, and as I say, there was a lot of lessons learned from the SuperNet, that\u2019s for sure. ", "18579 Now I just want to pose a question to you, we\u2019ve heard from Axia earlier on in the week, and they had the idea of the new basic infrastructure, which is basically to take future connectivity and sort of take it out of this -- this major playing field that everybody is kind of playing in right now, put is somewhere else for those people who wish to participate in it. So that was -- that was that idea. Then we know the SuperNet, we\u2019ve heard about the SuperNet and I know all of you know a lot about it. ", "18580 And then on paragraph 25 of your written submission, you talk a bit about private and public partnerships. And I presume that would have something to do with the optical ground wire, perhaps the development and deployment of that within that communication space. ", "18581 So my question for you is given that there is three sort of basic things -- and I would have put in the Vaxination submission too, because it was -- it was really, really interesting but it\u2019s not the Alberta context -- how -- what do you think were -- how would you cobble together something if you were going to say, design something for -- and use a different province, use Quebec, use Ontario, don\u2019t use Alberta -- how would our situation -- what would you put together and suggest?", "18582 MR. WINSOR: Thank you. And by the way, I agree, we certainly want -- we don\u2019t want to paint the SuperNet as a -- as a failure per se, there's a lot of frustration that it\u2019s not as good as it could be, but that\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not better than not having it at all.", "18583 So now we\u2019re building a SuperNet-like construct in another province or territory.", "18584 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm.", "18585 MR. WINSOR: One of the building principles behind the SuperNet was to use the trunk area, the base area network, where there already was fibre from carriers such as Bell or Telus, and then to put fibre extensions in to form the complete network in the extended area network.", "18586 One of the shortcomings was that the Crown didn\u2019t end up with any rights to that base area of fibre at the end of the contract. So come 2018, June of 2018, when those SuperNet contracts expire, there will be a lot of stranded little pieces if we don\u2019t find another replacement for the base. And the province is currently issuing RFPs to replace that.", "18587 Where there is fibre that\u2019s been built with public dollars, we believe that that fibre should be accessible and part of building a public access network. And in many cases, that goes hand in hand with the electrical transmission system. I think it\u2019s an asset that hasn\u2019t been used. ", "18588 We\u2019ve heard others talking about putting fibre on poles. I'm not talking about poles within the distribution system. We\u2019re talking here about the actual fibre bundle in the transmission system. And at least in Alberta -- and I'm assuming the same in this fictional province that I\u2019m not wiring up -- there is a transmission charge on every electrical customer\u2019s bill for the transmission charge to build that out. With access to that to form your trunk lines, that actually gets you a long way to starting to build your new SuperNet. ", "18589 Additionally, because at least from Alberta, that was built out with the rebuild of a lot of the transmission system. With policy changes it\u2019s possible to say that wherever we carry the electrical transmission and distribution system, we can carry fibre as we build, that's not going to happen tomorrow.", "18590 Commissioner Menzies pointed about triaging this, it\u2019s a long view, but all of that system does get built out and refreshed over time. And the cost to add the optical ground wire is relatively small compare to the cost of building other systems.", "18591 So as I build out these other systems, would I do it as a public/private partnership? M'hm. I would certainly want to know that at the end of that PPP, the assets would revert to the Crown and we would have something at the end of the day, not something that vaporizes, because people do build dependency on these systems. They want to know that those schools, those hospitals and indeed those homes, are connected and will stay connected regardless. ", "18592 Effectively, SuperNet is now too big to fail and is a bit of a worry given the model that was put in place at the start, because we need it and this new fictional province will need it to. ", "18593 So using whatever\u2019s there that's been paid for by the taxpayer, effectively any -- a patchwork, not a patchwork, a tapestry -- better than a patchwork -- that ties it all together is the way to go.", "18594 Is that a start?", "18595 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. So in your mind -- I don\u2019t know if you -- did you hear the presentation from Eastlink this morning?", "18596 MR. WINSOR: I heard the last part of it.", "18597 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, and the estimate there -- it was just -- it was just an estimate that he was kind of throwing out, would be that it would cost billions and billions and billions of dollars to connect the country. And in your mind, would it be a fair thing to say that we should start to look at what's already there and utilize what's there before rolling out something that\u2019s new ---", "18598 MR. WINSOR: We should ---", "18599 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- everywhere?", "18600 MR. WINSOR: We should absolutely use whatever is there. Again, we feel that as long as the infrastructure has the resiliency and can be treated as critical infrastructure, which the electrical transmission system is, then that's a great place to start. But facilities-based competition, if it\u2019s billions and billions for one to do it, it\u2019s many more billions for all the others to do it right alongside, and it\u2019s unnecessary. ", "18601 We also have as, you know, again I\u2019ll come back to -- the satellite situation is changing rapidly ---", "18602 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm.", "18603 MR. WINSOR: --- and when it does, it will not be a fixed bill that we\u2019ll deal with for 10 years. The solutions that are being put up there will only stay in orbit for one and a half to two years. They're sitting just above the space station, they're going to be coming down -- well not quite as fast as they're being launched, but it\u2019s a constant refresh. So if a satellite has a couple years\u2019 life, the one that goes up six months, a year later after the first one, will have better and better technology. ", "18604 So these are solutions that all put together in a strategy that says we\u2019re going to have this for the short-term, this for the medium, this for the long, a national broadband strategy, will actually give us a much better picture at lower cost than just building it all and doing it again every 10 years.", "18605 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah. So would it be fair to say that a guiding principle for us of a broadband strategy would be to utilize existing infrastructure, locate when possible existing infrastructure?", "18606 DR. CARRA: Yeah, I think so. I mean -- I\u2019ll just go back to Alberta for the sake of the argument, but I mean we know that each telco provider has, you know, pipes between Calgary and Edmonton for example, right alongside the SuperNet.", "18607 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm.", "18608 DR. CARRA: I think if some of those -- and I don\u2019t want to carve off their -- their investment, but you know, if you could carve off some of that and turn it into supporting that open infrastructure size, so every time something new goes in, some of it\u2019s private, some of it\u2019s open, but it creates that whole picture. I think you can almost build a system that\u2019s a little bit more flexible and has some more play and movement in it. ", "18609 Municipal -- municipalities, you know, as we look at sort of that structural separation model in our submission, are looking at how you can do that. And some of it they carve off as private, it\u2019s secure, nobody touches it except for themselves, it's for, you know, 911 Emergency Response Units, and then some of it they sell and wholesale and lease to people like us, you know. And if we can use what's in the ground, but create an environment that's more flexible like this type of model, I think it would go a long way to help relieve the pressure in terms of getting access to communities.", "18610 So a lot of those little tiny communities that are ready to go, they want to do something, they're sitting there, they're having working groups, they're trying to put models together, they're trying to come up with plans in how they would build it and pay for it and, you know, deploy it within their communities. But then they're also trying to figure out how to connect it to the backhaul.", "18611 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm.", "18612 DR. CARRA: How can we get from our small town to the next place so we can actually access services? It\u2019s one thing to wire up the community, but it\u2019s another thing to actually have it access something.", "18613 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm.", "18614 DR. CARRA: And there's those breaks and points, and I think if we can start breaking those apart and tackling them in little places it would help relieve the pressure overall in terms of building the big picture.", "18615 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you have any ideas or thoughts on how we could deal with the donut hole problem that we have been hearing a lot about? How do we get to those ---?", "18616 MR. WINSOR: The community broadband will solve a lot of that. The community is, after all, not trying to make shareholders happy; they're trying to make the residents of their community happy, and they're not going to build only to the profitable centre; they will reach all of their ratepayers when they can.", "18617 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: In your view, do you think that the community pretty much needs to have a champion for -- to put that together?", "18618 DR. CARRA: They do. I mean, a lot of them do need guidance, leadership, instruction on how to do this. They want it, they see the benefit, they look to old, or other of the small communities that have tackled this thing as great examples and seeing these little communities take off, and the students and the colleges thrive. But they don't know how to get there themselves, and so they need a lot of that information and guidance.", "18619 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Yeah, we've heard a lot of that through our hearings too, where people are very dedicated and committed to what it is that they're doing.", "18620 DR. CARRA: Yeah, we just came out of a Smart Cities Intelligence Conference in Alberta too that was hosted not too long ago. And that was the underpinning to the entire conference, was how can we get connectivity so cities can start being more innovative with open data, open technologies, looking at wiring up, and increasing efficiencies even within municipal, you know, operations.", "18621 And but -- it all came back to connectivity. It's the underlying theme these days in every conversation about how we move forward.", "18622 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Do you see the Commission as having a role in something like that?", "18623 MR. WINSOR: Yes, we do. The two main problems that those communities have is access to expertise and access to funds. And at the moment, they cannot readily draw on subsidies to help them buy the expertise and build out their infrastructure.", "18624 They need help. Whether that's directly from the province or the territory or through subsidy funds that are made available by CRTC, they need some help to do it. They have the will; they do not have the means.", "18625 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Thank you, those are all my questions.", "18626 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, and those are the questions for the panel and legal counsel as well. So thank you very much for having participated and I'm sure you'll participate in the next phases as well.", "18627 Just -- and pay attention -- we're starting at 8:30 tomorrow morning.", "--- Upon adjourning at 1:17 p.m. ", "REPORTERS", "Sean Prouse", "Mathieu Bastien-Marcil", "Lucie Morin-Brock", "Ren\u00e9e Vaive", "Lyne Charbonneau", "Karen Pare", "Ian Schryber", "Krista Campbell", "Kathy Poirier", "Karen Noganosh", "Mathieu Philippe", "Date modified: ", "2016-04-27"]},

Eastlink, when we talked about the nature of the problem in front of us, talked about tens of billions of dollars. Others have talked about a billion to get caught up quickly and the world is changing very quickly.", "19102 And when I was thinking about this, $500 million, $100 million a year over five years to try to get 5 and 1 to people five years from now, some people would say that's -- that the speed -- that the way the necessity of internet is increasing as more and more government services are exclusively on it and the education system that that's inefficient.", "19103 What is your view on that? What is $100 million a year, given to size of the problem we're looking at, going to do to get Canadians fully connected in five years?", "19107 MR. B\u00c9LAND: And I\u2019ll just add that the -- in a sense, we're technological optimists here. So if you just let it alone, we would be confident that technology would take care of the job within a fairly short period of time, particularly with the evolution of wireless -- fixed and mobile wireless technologies and satellite technologies.", "19108 What the \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d program and the new 500 million of the federal government does really is accelerate that job rather than just letting technology take care of it. Even if we're confident that that will happen, it accelerates the job a bit.", "19109 And that's why we're so insistent with our recommendation about renewing that program -- maybe tweaked but renewing it because you can do that fast. And in terms of the amount of money, if you just look in round numbers, you know, the last chapter of \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d was roughly 300 million and it connected roughly 300,000 homes. That's $1,000 a home. So $500 million of new money at $1,000 a home, that's a lot of connections.", "19110 And even if the next wave is a little harder to get to than the last wave, maybe it's not 1,000, maybe it's 2,000, that's still an awful lot of money, an awful lot of people that you can connect quickly if you renew the existing model rather than spending two years studying a new model.", "19111 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It's really the timeframe of the spend that caught my eye more than the amount.", "19112 Another question, many people have asked us to implement subsidies and funds ourselves and by the end of the first week, we were talking $2 a month on people\u2019s internet bills. At the end of the second week, it was more like five and yesterday, they're estimating around 10.", "19113 What is the tolerance among your customers for increases or additional fees on their internet bills to participate in bringing more service to Canadians?", "19114 MS. BROUILLETTE: You mean like taxing all Canadians to make sure that everybody can access?", "19115 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You might use that word but ---", "19116 MS. BROUILLETTE: Yes. I think -- I think it's a risky place to look at. We should be careful and I think that the way the program has been built so far, because the way it's done, we have to also talk about price point in the new deployment and I think that so far it worked pretty well.", "19117 So I wouldn\u2019t go there shortly and I just would tweak, as Dennis mentioned, the applicable forum to make sure that maybe the pacing of deployment is faster if needed, but I think it's a risky path to take.", "19119 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Vennard?", "19120 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: I would like to follow up on what Vice-Chair Menzies was just talking about and that is the tweaking of the \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d program.", "19121 You mentioned that you had a different vision for it than what Bell proposed. And you mentioned an analysis grid and then we kind of circled back to that and then sort of touched on it again.", "19122 Could you explain -- or I'd like to put some edges around that. What would be on that analysis grid?", "19123 MR. B\u00c9LAND: We don\u2019t actually know in detail because that's Industry Canada\u2019s internal assessment grid for the program.", "19124 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm, but if you would do that ---", "19125 MR. B\u00c9LAND: We have ---", "19126 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: --- what would you put on it?", "19127 MR. B\u00c9LAND: Well, we have -- first of all, we have some pretty good indications with their detailed document that they provided to -- a public document that guides the parties that would like to submit projects for subsidies.", "19128 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm.", "19129 MR. B\u00c9LAND: And it's admittedly complex, but a lot of procurement -- in a sense, it's almost a procurement program. A lot of government procurement is complex.", "19130 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: M'hm.", "19131 MR. B\u00c9LAND: So the -- part of it is you need to define clearly what you're buying, what you're subsidizing, in this case. So you're talking about the speeds, and the retail price, and the data cap, and any other pertinent factors.", "19132 But in terms of the analysis grid, you're looking at things like how many homes will be covered, because again, one technology might cover more than another. You're looking at things like the evolution path of the technology. There has to be a sense in that grid that if someone is proposing a technology that factually, you know, based on the understanding of the experts in Innovation Canada that factually looks to have a better technology evolution path in another technology, you win points for that.", "19133 Another issue that was raised by some participants at this hearing is the notion that there should be some sense of additional points for a player that has a demonstrated past success in deploying networks. So it's the compilation of these factors that forms your analysis grid for the program.", "19134 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: So that would be the technical factors, the track record of the people that will be deploying it.", "19135 What about the -- and of course, price would fit in to it -- characteristics of the community? Do you see this analysis grid as having a public input into it as well? Because really, if we're looking at an analysis grid, what we're doing is saying this is the way we're going to make decisions, whoever this \"we\" is that is making the decisions.", "19136 MR. B\u00c9LAND: Again, our view is the model is there. Again, it works very well. I think the public input is happening right now. You're hearing, over the past three weeks, some of the factors that parties believe may not be sufficiently considered. And I think you've just had that phase. You can make your recommendations to Innovation Canada.", "19137 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: But we've heard differing perspectives, too, and also some different facts. Where people will look at even something like our mapping and say, well, it says that we're covered but we're not. So there is -- there's, you know, sort of room for improvement in mapping and different pieces of information too, upon which very important decisions will be made.", "19138 MR. B\u00c9LAND: Yeah, on the mapping point, as we mentioned earlier, there -- it appears there may be place for some improvement in that interchange to allow communities to question their status in the map, yes.", "19139 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, so that -- with that kind of tweaking, then, you would be reasonably happy with what there is already?", "19140 MR. B\u00c9LAND: Yes.", "19141 COMMISSIONER VENNARD: Okay, thank you.", "19142 Those are all my questions.", "--- Upon recessing at 10:25 a.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 10:42 a.m.", "19146 THE CHAIRPERSON: Order, please.", "19147 It would appear that our hearing room is less empty than it normally is on the last day of the hearing, but that's all good.", "19149 THE SECRETARY: Thank you.", "19150 We will now hear the presentation of OpenMedia. Please introduce yourself and your colleagues, and you have 10 minutes for your presentation.", "PRESENTATION", "19151 MR. TABISH: Good morning.", "19152 Before we begin, OpenMedia wishes to acknowledge the unceded Algonquin territory upon whose land we stand today for this important hearing.", "19153 Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, thank you for having us here today.", "19154 My name is Josh Tabish and I am the Campaigns Director for OpenMedia, a community-based organization that sees the Internet as a place equally accessible to everyone that empowers people to build a more connected and collaborative world.", "19155 I am joined today by OpenMedia's Digital Rights Specialist, Ms. Laura Tribe to my left; and our Policy Consultant, Dr. David Ellis, to my right.", "19156 I'd like to thank the CRTC staff, especially Madame Secretary Jade Roy for all her help so far, and I would also like to appreciate OpenMedia's inspiring community, many of whom you can in the audience behind me.", "19157 Finally, I would like to thank our amazing staff back home at OpenMedia HQ, who have made a number of sacrifices to help us be here today.", "19158 Before I begin our presentation, I'd like to hand the floor -- or as we begin our presentation -- sorry -- I'd love to hand the floor over to my colleague, Laura.", "19159 MS. TRIBE: Since 2008, OpenMedia has engaged hundreds of thousands of Canadians to identify citizen-driven priorities for a more equitable digital future. Through this process, we have created two crowdsourced telecom reports, which propose common-sense telecom policies to remedy our dysfunctional Internet market.", "19160 In the present proceeding, nearly 45,000 members of OpenMedia's community have endorsed an open letter asking that basic service in Canada must be defined to include affordable, world-class broadband Internet for 100 percent of the population. Several thousand more provided unique testimonials.", "19161 These citizens' voices constitute what we believe was the largest source of public participation in this proceeding, and we urge the Commission to use their voices as a compass when making your final determinations.", "19162 As Heidi Daehler from Montreal, Quebec, said:", "19163 \"Internet access has become a basic tool necessary for most people. Please do what you can to help it be accessible to all. Thank you.\"", "19164 Or as Hugo Vaillancourt, from North West River, Newfoundland, put it:", "19165 \"Do we want Canada to keep making the headlines about how we're one of the industrialized countries that pays the most for the worst Internet? Or do we want to be number one? It's all a matter of vision, in the end.\"", "19166 After reviewing our community's contributions and placing them on the public record,", "19167 OpenMedia consulted with Dr. Ellis to develop a strategy consistent with the grassroots priorities identified. We are here to ensure 100 percent of Canadians have both fixed and mobile broadband access to the Internet that is affordable, high quality and offered by a wide range of service providers.", "19168 A handful of parties in this proceeding claim there is no problem. Yet scores of intervenors such as the Affordable Access Coalition, Media Access Canada, and the Eastern Ontario Warden's Caucus and Rural Network, have all convincingly demonstrated that Canada's digital divide crosses urban-rural boundaries.", "19169 Put simply: This is not just a rural problem, or a problem of the North. This is a national problem and it calls for a national solution.", "19170 As powerful, courageous testimony from ACORN members and disabilities stakeholders reminds us, Canada's digital divide doesn't just prevent marginalized groups from accessing the Internet. This divide actually perpetuates and -- worse yet -- accentuates problems of inequality. This gap between digital-haves and digital-have-nots is a glaring problem the Commission must address.", "19171 And now, I turn the floor over to David, to outline some forward-looking considerations for the Internet in Canada.", "19172 DR. ELLIS: Thanks, Laura.", "19173 I'd like to make a brief comment about four topics, and we have slides today.", "19174 First of all, whatever the outcome of this proceeding, there should be no further public support for outdated legacy networks. Cable's market lead over DSL is an old story, but we decided to raise this issue today after hearing SaskTel suggest on Monday that their 5/1 platform is perfectly adequate for their customers' needs, and I think we heard much the same story just now from Quebecor.", "19175 We're concerned some carriers will fight to keep DSL running even at the expense of losing more customers to cable. DSL is now over 10 years old and can no longer meet the needs of Canadian consumers.", "19176 I apologize; this one is a little hard to read. I'll explain it in our discussion later, perhaps.", "19177 Our second point here is that we believe that the most significant price issue in Canada's ISP market is the gradual disappearance of low-cost plans. In early markets, where broadband is a luxury product, service providers provide a wide range of prices to gain market share.", "19178 As penetration rises, however, broadband becomes a necessity and demand, as the economists say, becomes inelastic to price. In other words, consumers will keep buying even as prices rise. Then providers no longer need to offer low-cost plans -- exactly what has happened in Canada and exactly why adoption is not a proxy for affordability.", "19179 Third, we believe that the CRTC must keep careful track of customer demand and encourage investment in network growth to meet that demand. Cisco estimates that over the 2014-2019 period Canada\u2019s IP traffic will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 22 percent. Canada\u2019s actual internet traffic, which is a large proportion of all IP traffic, is itself growing at a compound annual growth rate of 27 percent. This growth is reflected in the number of networked devices used by Canadians, which will double over this period from 185 million to 382 million.", "19180 Finally, the results from the Commission\u2019s two broadband surveys point to a critical, but little-discussed issue, the information deficit that afflicts end-users.", "19181 In the main survey, 50 percent of respondents say they have no idea what they\u2019re paying for. I believe that figure greatly under-represents the real problem. Other research suggest that as many as 80 percent of broadband customers are in the dark about their own service speeds. This information challenge extends to all aspects of the subscriber relationship with ISPs, which make little effort to help their customers understand how they can get the best out of their internet access or what it would take to improve their service and save money.", "19182 I urge the Commission to consider carefully what this information deficit means for claims by the incumbents that their customers are satisfied with under-performing 5/1 service or that there\u2019s no demand for higher speeds. This is another indication of the need for the Commission to play a much greater role in assessing what consumers need and whether ISPs are meeting current demand.", "19183 I hope we\u2019ll have time to discuss these issues further. I\u2019ll hand the floor back to Laura in the meantime.", "19184 MR. TABISH: Or to Josh.", "19185 DR. ELLIS: Or to Josh, if you prefer.", "19186 MR. TABISH: Commissioners, evidence over the past three weeks confirms that market forces alone continue to be inadequate to provide reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality, accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada. Indeed, Canadians continue to pay some of the highest prices in the industrialized world for what\u2019s widely recognized as middle of the road service.", "19187 Mr. Chairman, on April 19", "th", " you asked presenters to focus on the task of figuring out what to do. You posed three important questions to us which we would now like to address. ", "19188 Your first question, Mr. Chairman: Where are there gaps in access to connectivity? As we just heard, low cost options have disappeared in Canada. As the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project pointed out, nearly one in five households have no residential internet connection, and nearly one in three have no mobile phone. Unserved and underserved areas exist all across Canada.", "19189 To demonstrate this, we created a short documentary detailing the gaps of Bowen Island -- the gaps in access to Bowen Island, a small community just off the coast of Vancouver. The full video can be found at unblockcanada.ca, and we would love to screen it for people in the room with your permission, Mr. Chairman, at the end of our speech.", "19190 Your second question: Given those gaps, what are the best strategies in order to close or eliminate them? First, mandate that all Canadian carriers offer a reasonably priced 5/5 basic broadband plan with minimum speed guarantees. Second, ensure policy is based on real-world performance measurements. And finally, create a sustainable funding mechanism drawn from the large operators to encourage both fixed and mobile broadband development with open access rules.", "19191 Which brings us to your third question, Mr. Chairman: Who is in the best position to implement those strategies? Right now, the answer is you, the CRTC in coordination with others.", "19192 The Commission has the mandate, and as you\u2019ve said yourself, this may very well be our last best chance to get this right, and we agree. And our fellow intervenors and nearly 45,000 OpenMedia community members who have spoken out through our campaign to put this issue -- sorry -- who have spoken out through our campaign have put this issue on the table and made your path very clear.", "19193 And I will make you a promise, if you get this right and plant a bold flag for Canada\u2019s internet, the OpenMedia community will do everything in its power to drag the federal government, kicking and screaming if necessary, into a coordinated national broadband strategy that will build on your vision and ensure every Canadian has access to broadband internet services.", "19194 Now, as we approach the end of this proceeding, a theme has clearly emerged that we can\u2019t afford to overlook. The internet\u2019s importance for markets and the digital economy is only part of the story. This hearing is about something a bit bigger. ", "19195 At OpenMedia, we believe the internet is crucial infrastructure for democracy.", "19196 As we\u2019ve heard for weeks, government consultation, access to education, and public services, to name a few, are increasingly happening online. ", "19197 Citizen engagement online is a lot more than sending emails and online banking, despite what some parties may tell you, and we need forward looking standards that reflect that. ", "19198 The OpenMedia community is calling for faster, cheaper internet for 100 percent of Canadians.", "19199 The question may arise, is our vision for Canada\u2019s digital future too good to be true? No, absolutely not. Democratic necessities are never too good to be true, they\u2019re just hard to get.", "19200 You asked us to bring the voices of Canadians and we did so, and we sincerely hope that you listen to them. We know it won\u2019t be easy, and we know this is not going to happen overnight, but it\u2019s time for bold action.", "19201 Thank you for your time today, and we're happy to answer any questions you may have.", "19202 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "19203 First of all, with respect to your video, you know, we\u2019ve got to be equitable to everyone in allotted time, so it\u2019s publicly available and it\u2019s probably now been posted through our Twitter link, your full submission, and you\u2019ve got your link in there so people can go and watch it obviously after they\u2019ve heard your presentation.", "19204 MR. TABISH: Of course.", "19205 THE CHAIRPERSON: We wouldn\u2019t want that happening, let alone it might take down our local Wi-Fi.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "19206 THE CHAIRPERSON: And my second comment is, you know, kicking and screaming is not my normal ", "modus operandi", ", and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more goodwill out there then having to drag anybody into something, so let\u2019s be positive about this.", "19207 I\u2019ll put you in the hands of Commissioner MacDonald to start us off.", "19208 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Good morning, and thank you for being here today all the way from Vancouver.", "19209 I did have a chance to view your video last night, and I prepared my questions but I\u2019m going to change things around, and I\u2019d like to have a conversation about -- or ask the questions in the context of what I viewed on the video. ", "19210 Because although the viewpoint was very clear -- I mean, obviously that was part of a larger conversation that you were having with the residents of Bowen Island, and in the interest of time I\u2019m sure part of those conversations ended up on the cutting room floor.", "19211 So I\u2019d like to understand exactly what services and speeds are available to the residents of the island today.", "19212 MR. TABASH: Absolutely. And I\u2019ll just preface my answers with saying I don\u2019t want to be seen as speaking on behalf of the residents -- or rather, the municipality of Bowen Island, I will only be speaking to you what I have heard and what I\u2019ve been told, so I don\u2019t want to put words in anybody\u2019s mouth.", "19213 The services available to Bowen Island are a TELUS DSL network and a Shaw cable network that is fed by a microwave transmission tower, which I think the -- if I remember this correctly, it was something like -- it was under a gig for the tower that then gets split between all the households. The tower doesn\u2019t receive very much bandwidth.", "19214 The second piece that\u2019s most frustrating for the residents of Bowen Island is that a fibre line transport facilities owned by TELUS travels undersea from Vancouver over Bowen Island, cuts right through the middle of it using their public rights-of-way, goes back under water and terminates on the Sunshine Coast.", "19215 And so the question has been for residents of Bowen Island can\u2019t we get access to that, and those discussions, as I understand it, have not been terribly productive between the residents and TELUS.", "19216 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And, to the best of your knowledge, what has been the response or the rationale that TELUS has provided? ", "19217 Is it it would be too expensive to break out that fibre that\u2019s crossing the island or it would be too expensive to build the last mile facilities on the island? Where\u2019s the stumbling block?", "19218 MR. TABISH: That question is best answered by the Bowen Island\u2019s Connectivity Working Group. I would say that I know that Telus and Bell have both sent representatives since my time on the island to appear before them. But the status of those negotiations is not clear to me.", "19219 I know that the municipality was debating asking about access to that transport infrastructure. Unfortunately, because of the forbearance decision in 2015-326, I think that\u2019s going to be a bit hard for them. They may be able to come to some type of private arrangement if that\u2019s what the municipality wants to pursue. But as I understand it, both Shaw and Telus have made commitments to work with them, but I don\u2019t know the status of that since I appeared a few weeks ago.", "19220 MR. MacDONALD: We heard from other service providers, and I believe it might have been SaskTel, that when there are situations where they can\u2019t make a business case work to build into a community that they will work with the community in question and perhaps do a bit of a cost share between themselves, between area residents or between the municipality. To your knowledge, have the conversations between Telus and the residents on Bowen Island progressed that far yet?", "19221 MR. TABISH: Since my visit was so recent, I think it was about three weeks or four weeks ago, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve gotten that far in their discussions.", "19222 In general, OpenMedia is supportive of approaches that leverage the knowledge and institutional strength of local intermediaries like the municipal government to find solutions. You\u2019ve heard on the record of the proceeding, the Eastern Ontario Regional Network and Stratford, Ontario and others who have cobbled together these networks that have been very powerful. So I wonder if that might be an option for them.", "19223 But in terms of cost sharing, as in like if everyone chips in 1,000 bucks we can get fibre to your house, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve gotten to that point yet. Our kind of more preferred approach is to leverage those local institutions and drive that in the public interest.", "19224 MR. MacDONALD: In your video, and it looked like you were in a bit of a town hall setting having a conversation with multiple residents, you outline different things they could do. They could contact the CRTC. They could engage their local MP or essentially they could look at building the network themselves. And you were having a conversation with one gentleman. And what was the reaction to the \u201cyou can build it, you can build your own last mile network as other regions and municipalities have done?\u201d", "19225 MR. TABISH: It was a mixture of curiosity and incredible excitement. The idea that communities across Canada are stepping up to fill -- to bridge the digital divide and to meet the requirements of their constituents in a way that is guided by the public interest and suited to their social and economic needs is a very exciting one. And it\u2019s not one that I think many municipalities realize they have available to them.", "19226 My colleague Robin Winsor from Cybera yesterday was talking about -- or it may have been Barb, sorry. But from Cybera they were talking about barriers to this knowledge, to expertise, to what their rights are. I mean, one question that I was asked was as simple as do we even have a right to do this? Is this okay under the CRTC\u2019s rules? ", "19227 And so there\u2019s a gap in knowledge there that I think the Commission could work to help address by working with, as Chairman Blais pointed out, a kind of more coordinated strategy that leverages various levels of government to put options on the table that improve the health of our ecosystem.", "19228 But I think to answer your question, to give you a shorter answer, they were very excited by the idea. But they started asking of course then, how does it cost? And what\u2019s the price per foot? And, you know, I\u2019m the advocate. I\u2019m not the engineer. So that\u2019s their next step.", "19229 MR. MacDONALD: We\u2019ll leave those conversations to the engineers.", "19230 And you started to touch on it, but what can -- setting aside funding for right now because that\u2019s a conversation we\u2019ll get into later, what do you think the CRTC could actually do to help get that information out there in a public forum, make our rules more clear, help these parties engage with other communities that are out there doing this already? What role can we play in that relationship?", "19231 MR. TABISH: I think that -- a while back I started a research project with my colleague Cynthia who is now at PIAC. We did a quick research project and we were looking at what research on municipal networks and the rights of municipalities to build municipal networks exist. And I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you phone the CRTC and see if they\u2019ve got a starter pack, you know?\u201d And I know you won\u2019t have a starter pack, but you see the point I\u2019m making. You know, what are our rights as a municipality?", "19232 And we didn\u2019t get -- we had a hard time identifying a resource that quite fit the bill. And so I think looking at, for example, consultations with EORN, with Stratford, with the City of Coquitlam, with the SuperNet in Alberta to look at what are the ranges of options available in consultation with these regional municipal governments and find out just what\u2019s out there and what the options are, to then distribute those in consultation with these stakeholders. I think it\u2019s about coordination and communication. And I -- and helping bridge that gap. ", "19233 But a good starting point is what can they do? A resource like that from the CRTC would be very powerful.", "19234 MR. MacDONALD: In your original submission you had letters from many thousands of individuals. And in the letter, just to read one line, \u201cThe U.S. recently defined broadband 25 megs down, 3 megs up. Our targets should be at least this ambitious.\u201d So 25 down, 3 up. And then today you\u2019re recommending a five and five service. So I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s changed?", "19235 MR. TABISH: I\u2019m going to start to answer that question and then I\u2019m going to offer opportunities for David or Laura to jump in.", "19236 So we\u2019re arguing for both. We\u2019re arguing for a basic 5/5 symmetric package that\u2019s reasonably priced now, and we\u2019re arguing for aspirational targets for 2020. And the reason is, in our interrogatories we -- and in both our interrogatories and in our survey of M-Lab data on real world network performance we came to 5/5 because it\u2019s what the -- it\u2019s what the carriers can do nationally now. It\u2019s well within their capabilities to do 5/5 symmetric. Both the interrogatories and the network data available suggest that.", "19237 And the challenge here is that the low cost options have disappeared. And we need a reasonably priced low cost option that is uniform across the country to give some reassurance to the businesses, to the individuals that, you know, live their lives here in Canada, that there\u2019s a basic quality level guarantee across the board from coast to coast to coast. So it\u2019s us trying to be reasonable is the 5/5, and to be helpful.", "19238 The ambitious speed targets, that\u2019s the second stage. Get a baseline now and bring relief as fast as we can because we could do 5/5 tomorrow. We can\u2019t do 25/3 or 25/15 tomorrow so this is kind of the first step and I\u2019ll offer Laura or David if you want to add anything to that.", "19239 DR. ELLIS: Commissioner, let me add a comment to what Josh has just said about the assumptions that we would like to see behind either an aspirational target or the other target for a basic service like 5/5. ", "19240 And without overstating the point, I think I\u2019d like to say that the assumptions that go with revising targets are every bit as important as the targets themselves. So first of all, there has been a good deal of talk about advertised versus measured speeds. And we would -- we feel very strongly that any monitoring and enforcement of speeds in the future is based on a measurement rather than on advertised speeds or anything that's less adequate.", "19241 The second thing is that these speeds have to allow for annual growth, something that I touched on in our opening remarks.", "19242 The third thing is that -- and I don't if we're going to have a further conversation about data caps -- but we also feel very strongly that any attempt to include data caps with -- into the calculation of whether targets have been reached, in other words, whether a policy is successful, I think is going to be self-defeating.", "19243 And I think the last thing is that that these targets are intended to send a signal that symmetric bandwidth is extremely important. One of my big problems with the 5/1 configuration is that it assumes that the uplink is of no real interest to Canadians and we don't need symmetric bandwidth and may not for a very long time.", "19244 Well, there's a whole series of things going on in the industry now, not the least of which is Cloud computing, which I think tells us that we have to work a lot harder and faster to get to symmetric or near symmetric access networks.", "19245 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So what would you say to a company like SaskTel, for example, who were here and they were very much of the belief that 1 meg up was adequate? I don't even believe they offered a service that provided more than 1 meg up.", "19246 DR. ELLIS: Any support.", "19247 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So what would your comments be to that company and others that share that belief that 1 meg is adequate?", "19248 DR. ELLIS: Well, my comment, Commissioner MacDonald, is -- and I happened to be in the room for that presentation, and we were here this morning for Quebecor. I think this is, first of all, an entirely self-serving position. It has little or nothing to do with what the incumbent ISPs think that their customers actually need.", "19249 They've -- they base their business plans on making bandwidth a scarce resource, which of course, goes along with their use of data caps. And the idea that this is -- that this somehow reflects consumer needs, I think is a little disingenuous.", "19250 The other thing is that -- and I confess that I am baffled that an incumbent like SaskTel, or for that matter, Quebecor, would be planning its own future on the basis of this kind of networked apology, when it seems so obvious to many of us that it's going to be entirely -- well, I would venture to say it's entirely inadequate already, and certainly will be very soon for most Canadians.", "19251 And this is apart from the whole issue of trying to have some vision to apply to the development of networks, which I think has been entirely missing from the incumbent's plans.", "19252 MS. TRIBE: I would just add to that that I think one of things we would say to SaskTel is we need better. And we can't just be basing our service on the minimums that we can provide now. Those aren't meeting the needs of Canadians.", "19253 Advertised speeds are different from a lot of the speeds that people are actually receiving, and beyond that, we're asking for a minimum that brings all Canadians online, gives them the services they need, and then above that, we're saying we need a vision. We need to look for future proof technologies and we need to be looking for something that's going to continue to meet the basic needs and all of the additional needs that Canadians have in the future.", "19254 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So not to dwell on SaskTel, but just as a follow-up. A couple of their packages don't even provide 1 meg up, and they said that they still receive a significant amount of uptake from customers purchasing speeds that are below 1 meg up.", "19255 So why are people buying that?", "19256 DR. ELLIS: Well, Commissioner, I think that there are a couple of reasons for that, the most obvious of which is price. And I noticed with great interest that SaskTel, in particular on Monday, kept talking about how their consumers like to -- tend to opt for slower packages down at the low end without ever mentioning the idea that price might be a barrier for buying into speeds at the higher end.", "19257 And the other thing that strikes me about that is that -- and this is something that I touched on in the last slide during our presentation -- I believe very strongly that we have a serious digital literacy problem in Canada that we share with other countries, like the United States. And when I say serious, I mean one that affects the majority of mainstream ISP customers.", "19258 And the net effect of this, I think -- and to return to your particular question -- is that the vast majority of ISP customers are in absolutely no position to judge what they're going to get by more bandwidth. I mean, first of all, they don't know what bandwidth is. They have a vague idea of what speed is.", "19259 They don't know what a gigabyte is, they don't know why they've caps, they don't know why they run over. It's almost impossible for the average customer to make rational choices about what their ISP is offering. Apart from the fact that, of course, what data caps are designed to do is to upsell customers from the cheaper packages with low caps to more expensive ones wherever they can.", "19260 MR. TABISH: So yeah, if I were to just summarize quickly. The question to SaskTel, and others, might be do they want to be Internet service providers of the 21", "st", " century or not. Because we've heard scores and scores of intervenors saying 5/1 isn't adequate, 5/1 isn't adequate. And so I'd put the question back to them.", "19261 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Just before I move on, the 5/5 target, should that be universal across the country, or do we need to look at the various geographies and the challenges they face in obtaining service and set different targets based on the geographic realities of the country?", "19262 MR. TABISH: I think the -- so the answer is ideally, yes, coast to coast to coast. And what we see here before the Commission in creating a 5/5 symmetric basic package is a tremendous incentive for the management of these companies to invest in more advanced network technologies and new offerings to ensure quality and to ensure a different experience for Canadians.", "19263 We see it as not interfering with market forces but encouraging our providers to do better. And again, as I said, our evidence that we've surveyed suggests they can do it.", "19264 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Who should pay for it?", "19265 MR. TABISH: The question of who should pay has come up quite a bit, and I think, you know, every level of government has a role to play. So a subsidy -- a sustainable subsidy regime developed by the Commission has a big role to play. Increased funding from the Federal Government, from Cabinet has a big role to play. There are other granting agencies throughout the country who have money to give out for these things.", "19266 So I think the answer is everyone has a role to play and we need to get together and make sure we're having the same conversation, which the Chairman alluded to in his speech last week.", "19267 And I'll invite Laura or David to add anything they want to that.", "19268 DR. ELLIS: I'd just like to add, Commissioner MacDonald, that the -- one of the issues I think in getting a number of different levels of government and the private sector cooperating in trying to get Canada caught up is coordination. And -- I mean, I think that while there's a major role for the CRTC to play on a number of fronts that have been discussed in this proceeding, it's not equipped to do it alone and it will have to partner up with sister agencies and other institutions that have resources, again, including the private sector.", "19269 But I don't believe that coordination is getting enough attention. So for example, we just heard from Quebecor a great deal of discussion about the $500 million, and Commissioner Menzies asked, I believe, whether that was adequate when it's spaced over five years.", "19270 Well, in addition to my sense that that's not adequate the other problem is, is this is just money that's being kind of tossed out with the best wishes in the world but there's very little way that we can judge whether this money is going to be well spent. And I say that on the basis of the way that $200 or $300 billion was spent by the previous government.", "19271 It's very difficult to assess whether the money was well spent and whether it could have been better spent if there was better coordination, not to mention that -- a little something called the National Broadband Strategy.", "19272 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So I take the point that money perhaps could be spent better and leveraged better, but if we continue talking just about government funding for a minute, if there needs to be more money directed from governments of all levels that means either they can raise taxes or they can cut that funding from other programs.", "19273 So to jump back to Bowen Island, where does internet rank in the priorities of those residents? Because if the funding goes to build broadband infrastructure maybe that means they don\u2019t get the new school down the road. So where\u2019s the priority?", "19274 MR. TABISH: This question comes up quite a bit, what is the cost of implementing these strategies, and, as I said on CBC Radio this morning, I think a great question in response is what is the cost of leaving Canadians behind.", "19275 Broadband services are a priority for Canadians. You\u2019ve heard that for three weeks from all sorts of passionate intervenors.", "19276 Where does it sit for the community of Bowen Island? It\u2019s pretty high up on the list right now. People are looking at having to move back to the mainland, which faces an extremely high housing affordability crisis. People are looking at having to change jobs. They\u2019re worried about youth leaving in the summer. They\u2019re worried about tourism because of course the usage demands are much higher in the summer than they are at other times of the year.", "19277 This is a huge concern for Canadians, and, as we said, the low cost options have disappeared and so we\u2019re going to need to exercise some pretty exciting regulatory imagination across all levels of government to think about what the cost is of leaving Canadians behind and how we can bridge that.", "19278 Commissioner Menzies has mentioned that, you know, we\u2019re hearing figures as high as, you know, billions and multiple billions of dollars and, you know, we can run the military for three years on these sums of money. That\u2019s true, but if you spend this money on broadband development you get to reap the benefits for the next 25 to 50 years in the global marketplace.", "19279 There\u2019s a big question of investment here in our digital future, and it\u2019s a question of political will at this point.", "19280 And as I promised to the Commission, using admittedly aggressive language, we\u2019re going to be there. If you guys chart this strategy, you plant the flag, we\u2019ve got your backs. ", "19281 DR. ELLIS: May I add something to that?", "19282 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Yes, of course.", "19283 DR. ELLIS: I think that you\u2019ve got -- or perhaps I should say we have got a two-pronged problem here. There is the basic fiscal problem which you\u2019ve raised, which of course is a serious one, we\u2019re talking about a lot of money and it\u2019s got to come from somewhere and not many people -- or a lot of people won\u2019t be happy to see that money diverted from other programs, as was just mentioned.", "19284 But I think that there\u2019s -- not to sound overly pessimistic, but I think that there\u2019s another problem on top of that which has to do with the political sell. And I say that because I believe that in the long run if we added -- I know the price has been going up day by day at this hearing. If we added X number of dollars to everybody\u2019s monthly bill -- I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s at now, $10 or something -- that we would -- I can\u2019t prove it, but I think we\u2019re convinced that we would save a lot of money in the long-run instead of going from patchwork quilt to patchwork quilt. That five or 10 years from now over the longer term that Josh was referring to we\u2019ll save money. But that\u2019s very difficult to sell to subscribers or taxpayers, and it\u2019s difficult for two reasons.", "19285 Taking my $10 now, you\u2019re going to take less five years from now doesn\u2019t cut a lot of ice. But even worse than that, I go back to my hobby horse about the information deficit. If you tell people \u201cLook, we know from the development of cloud computing that, you know, we\u2019re going to need to spend this money\u201d people don\u2019t know what cloud computing means, they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s being spent on.", "19286 And I say this -- by the way -- if you\u2019ll indulge me, Mr. Chairman, just to illustrate what I mean. I teach liberal arts undergraduates how the internet works, and I can tell you after years and years of doing this that these 20-somethings who think they\u2019re digital natives who are majoring in communication studies are as baffled as everybody else. They don\u2019t know what a megabit per second is until I beat it into them for weeks. ", "19287 And so I extrapolate from that interesting classroom issue to the larger picture and I\u2019m pessimistic about being able to tell Canadians \u201cLook, if we take your money there\u2019ll be a great future for cloud computing\u201d whatever that is.", "19288 MS. TRIBE: I just wanted to add one thing to that. But you\u2019re sort of framing this as though it\u2019s just an expense, but we would put forward the argument that this is actually an investment, and rolling out this high quality services across Canada provides the residents of Bowen Island, and numerous other communities, more opportunities and the investment will be repaid in the long-run.", "19289 And so in some of these expenses that we\u2019re treating like a trade-off that\u2019s when you\u2019re just pouring money out the door, and that\u2019s not how we view this investment.", "19290 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: I\u2019ve spent 10 years of my life selling broadband, so I was selling the benefits of it, so I don\u2019t need to be sold on the benefits, I get that. And people in this hearing have been very clear about the benefits and they\u2019ve been very free with those opinions. What there\u2019s been a little bit more reluctance to do is to pull out their wallet and say \u201cYes, I\u2019m ready to have my bill go up by $10 a month.\u201d", "19291 So if that is what needs to happen to build out the network, and knowing what the benefits would be, how do we balance that need for the extra $10 a month on everyone\u2019s bill to build out the network with the affordability concerns that you also raise?", "19292 MR. TABISH: So step one is the near-term solution, which is the mandated basic package that will help bring quality and a reasonably priced option to all Canadians. That\u2019s the short-term goal. ", "19293 The long-term goal is a structural one. The fact that prices are going to go up in the near-term is a sign that we need, as others have said, more service-based competition and choice of providers in the market.", "19294 And so our proposals detailed in our submission balance both the near-term fix, which is get much needed relief in quality and price as soon as possible, and the long-term fix, which is ensure that any infrastructure that\u2019s built out has great open access provisions in it; make sure that any provider can sell on that; make sure that municipal and non-profit actors are empowered to join the market and sell services. That\u2019s how we fix the problem is by fostering choice and diversity of offerings and innovation.", "19295 So our proposals attempt to address that question both in the near-term and in the long-term and we think that\u2019s the elegance of it.", "19296 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: When you were inviting your members to come here today, you outlined five things that you wanted to accomplish, make sure that Canada no longer has slower broadband speeds, addressing, to use your words, oppressive data caps, the most expensive packages in the industrialized world, huge digital divide and the market being controlled by -- 90 percent controlled by big telecom. So I think we\u2019ve covered off much of that in the conversation so far, but I want to get back to oppressive data caps.", "19297 What should a data cap be on a basic package and is that something that should be mandated? Should there be a mandated minimum data cap on a basic package?", "19298 MR. TABISH: So on the basic package question there shouldn\u2019t be data caps.", "19299 There\u2019s a number of other criteria that we feel the basic package needs to have -- and we can talk about those later -- things like it needs to be access to the full real internet, it can\u2019t be, for example, the incumbents version of free basics from Facebook. That would be a disaster. So there\u2019s quality constraints that we have and criteria we suggest around that.", "19300 But to come back to the question of data caps, data caps harm low income users disproportionately, because where do you find data caps, on cheap packages. Data caps have lost their utility as a network congestion management practice. That rationale doesn\u2019t cut it anymore and people are recognizing that through the course of this hearing. They\u2019re at this point a pricing tool, which doesn\u2019t quite jive with the principles set out in the ITMP framework.", "19301 The basic package needs to allow unfettered access to the Internet and oppressive data caps would hurt that. So if a provider said -- say you believed us and you decided you were going to do this basic package. The providers could come back and say, okay, we\u2019ll do the basic package but we\u2019re giving it a five gig cap. Well, how does that help Canadians?", "19302 Data caps broadly need to be phased out. We\u2019ve heard other people say this. If you look at OECD data, data caps are non-standard in OECD countries. You don\u2019t see them on wireline networks. And there\u2019s some other interesting insights from the Open Technology Institute\u2019s recent Artificial Scarcity Report that we cite.", "19303 So I would start there and I\u2019ll invite my colleagues to finish my answer -- or our answer.", "19304 DR. ELLIS: Well, I think that Josh has covered most of the important points. But I really want to emphasize the harm to exactly the market segment that we\u2019re trying to provide relief to, which is low income households, and for several reasons.", "19305 One is that low income households do not need any more complication or confusion about what they\u2019re buying and what they\u2019re getting for their money. And what they certainly don\u2019t want or need is a plan that will punish them financially if they use the Internet too much, which is a phrase I hope will disappear over the next couple of years as though there\u2019s something about using the Internet too much. And I\u2019m accepting, of course, anything that\u2019s straightforward abuse of network resources. It\u2019s a concept that just doesn\u2019t belong in this kind of conversation.", "19306 And I\u2019ve noted over the last three or four years that one of the things that the incumbent ISPs have done is that they have priced their low-end packages in a way that charges those subscribers more money per megabit per second and applies higher penalties at the low end than for faster packages.", "19307 So what I deduce from all of this is that the very Canadians that we would be setting out to help would be harmed by this. And this is not even to speak of what is discussed at some length in the Open Technology Institute report. The psychological disincentives that subscribers have if they are -- if they have data caps -- and by the way, I think this is very important because when we heard the group this morning say that only a certain number of customers actually get up to their cap, that people have lots of capacity because we can see what people are using, there are lost opportunities there that that ISP is not measuring. There are people are not doing thing online that they would have if they didn\u2019t have a cap.", "19308 MR. TABISH: And finally, data caps are especially important to keep in mind in an environment that is as vertically -- in a market environment that is as vertically integrated as Canada\u2019s is. There are tremendous incentives for the big telecom providers to use data caps as a means of protecting legacy services, like cable TV, to prevent people from streaming too much.", "19309 And, you know, we\u2019ve heard in other proceedings that Canadians are tired of bloated, outdated cable packages. And the Commission has taken really commendable steps towards that. And so we hope they do the same on this issue of data caps because the two are more related than they might seem off the top.", "19310 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: At my home I\u2019m on municipal water services. If I use more water I pay more. I have natural gas. If I use more natural gas I pay more. Why is the Internet different than that with respect to unlimited packages?", "19311 MS. TRIBE: Yes, I understand your point. But there is not a limit on the number of bits and bytes that we can have coming through. When we\u2019re looking at maximum capacity on the networks, I think that\u2019s what data caps were originally introduced to address. And as David and Josh have both pointed out, that\u2019s just not working right now. That\u2019s not what they\u2019re being used for anymore.", "19312 And there are fixed resources in the amount of natural gas that we have and the amount of fresh water that we have available in a way that just doesn\u2019t apply to the Internet. So I would argue that they\u2019re different.", "19313 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Just a couple of just final questions and then I\u2019ll hand it back over to my colleagues.", "19314 Okay. We\u2019ve got this 5/5 package. It\u2019s an unlimited service. How do we determine what a fair price is? Is it in relation to other countries? Is it a percentage of income? Cost to deliver the service?", "19315 MR. TABISH: That is a very good question. And it\u2019s one we admittedly struggled with a bit. But I think if we\u2019re going to talk about principles here, we see again -- sorry to sound repetitive, but we see a lack of low-cost options in the market. One of the charts we supply shows that the bottom range is considerably higher or the entry point price in the market is considerably higher than of comparable jurisdictions. And so the price for this package needs to be significantly below the going rate.", "19316 So if we -- we heard I think it was the Eastern Ontario Warden\u2019s Caucus talk about how prices have clustered around $50 depending on which region you\u2019re in. It needs to be significantly lower than that, say 30 or less. But I know the Commission has a variety of techniques and tricks and tools to arrive at that conclusion. And so that\u2019s where we would turn it over to you.", "19317 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: So if it\u2019s 30 bucks a month, does that eliminate the need for any other further subsidies for low-income individuals? Or is it 30 plus subsidy?", "19318 MR. TABISH: We think the approaches are complementary and that there could be space for both in the market. I don\u2019t want to be seen on the record of this proceeding as saying anything that underscores -- or sorry, undermines my colleagues in the Affordable Access Coalition and their proposal. We think their proposal is very well suited to their constituents and their -- who they represent. We think our proposal brings much needed relief and quality in price as fast as possible to as many people as possible. And so those approaches can be complementary. Put simply, it\u2019s a both and, from our perspective.", "19319 DR. ELLIS: Commissioner, could I just add to that a comment about eligibility. Just to reassure the Commission that, ever mindful of your resource constraints, we didn\u2019t imagine that this was the kind of program that the CRTC should tackle on its own just to take the eligibility issue by itself. This is something that your counterparts in Washington have -- are currently doing a great deal of work on for their -- the modernization of their Lifeline program, as you know.", "19320 And it\u2019s a big, complicated and expensive program to run. And I would imagine that the Commission would want to partner with other agencies, for example, Statistics Canada, to begin to get a, you know, a good picture of how you might frame the issue of eligibility in terms of household income and that kind of thing.", "19321 COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: Okay. Thank you. Those are my questions.", "19322 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.", "19323 Vice-Chair Menzies?", "19324 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thanks.", "19325 Two or three questions. In terms of getting to where you want to go, given that we can\u2019t -- well, we could try to get there all at once, but I asked this yesterday, if we were to triage the problems in terms of like the north filling the gap, remote First Nations affordability and capacity, where would we start?", "19326 MR. TABISH: You would start, I believe, by asking the people who know best. And those are the people on the ground.", "19327 We\u2019ve heard a lot about the -- what the model could -- well, we\u2019ve heard a bit about what the model could be for ---", "19328 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: To be fair, that\u2019s what this is.", "19329 MR. TABISH: This is true. This is true. Sorry, this is true. No disrespect intended.", "19330 But in the situation where we\u2019ve mandated it as a basic service and now we\u2019re looking at a world build out, say we mandate a world build out fund that\u2019s drawn from the big operators and we\u2019re going, okay, where do we point first? One of the things that we\u2019ve heard is what should the -- or that\u2019s been asked a bit is what should the distribution mechanism look like? Should it be, you know, NCF 2.0? Or are there other options available to us?", "19331 I think the thing that we worry about is that that decision-making power would become too centralized if it were NCF 2.0. We think there\u2019s a role for intermediary organizations and communities to play in the allocation of that funds. I know that takes us down a rabbit hole and is really complicated, but I worry that it would be too concentrated in the hands of the incumbents to make those decisions.", "19332 I think the more -- an approach that supports the public interest is one that leverages the knowledge of folks on the ground, and whether it's Bowen Island, or it's rural Ontario, or it's Nova Scotia, these groups have a lot to say about that question in particular.", "19333 And so we would hope the actual governance of that fund outside of this hearing, that the actual governance of that fund leverages that -- those smarts.", "19334 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, this -- I mentioned this yesterday and it comes up from time to time in terms of how Canada compares internationally. And in your opening remarks, I think you -- I mean, we can all be prone to hyperbole from time to time but you mentioned that we have one of the worst?", "19335 MR. TABISH: I've never been accused of that, actually.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "19336 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, I imagine not, nor have I. We can keep that between us.", "19337 The -- in terms of fair comparisons between countries, it always come up. And it's, perhaps -- I didn't wish to be unkind to Cybera yesterday, but when you get an example from England and I've looked at other connectivity lists, and here's the top 10 countries in the world. And because I get bored sometimes, I add up the square kilometres of all those countries and discover that I can fit them all into British Columbia.", "19338 And so what is -- the question being, this is a very, very large country with significant challenges around that. So in the course of your research, what would you recommend to us that we -- what are the fairest comparisons that we could look at in terms of performance in other countries?", "19339 MR. TABISH: I'll answer your ---", "19340 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Or the most -- fairest isn't the right word, the most relevant ---", "19341 MR. TABISH: Right, right.", "19342 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: --- comparisons in terms of ---?", "19343 MR. TABISH: And your point about comparing geographies is well taken. It's not always a fair comparison.", "19344 I'll start -- my first answer to your question is let's not look elsewhere too quickly. Let's look in our own backyard.", "19345 We see amazing work being done by the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, which is adapting, not only their socio and economic needs but their geographic needs, using a variety of technologies that are quite impressive. And we see other examples across Canada, the SuperNet being another example.", "19346 We have a lot to learn about our own geography within our own borders and what the solutions are. As my colleague, Dwayne Winseck, said many weeks ago now, geography is a factor but it's not a crutch, and it's being used as a crutch by certain operators and parties.", "19347 But if I were to directly answer your question and look at a comparable jurisdiction. Scandinavian countries that have embraced open access policies, the type that this Commission has very -- has put forward, that we approve of and applaud, countries that have embraced those policies to ensure a wide range of providers on infrastructure that isn't unnecessarily duplicated, and who faced -- like Sweden -- faced some of a similar geographic problems Canada does, we think there's a lot of insight to be learned there.", "19348 I know a lot is said of the EU laggard problem, but the lessons from the EU are on a case-by\u2011case basis, not looking at the whole. And when you look at countries like Sweden, for example, or others, Scandinavian countries, Canada can learn a lot.", "19349 And I'll invite others to add to that.", "19350 DR. ELLIS: I think that the point about geography is certainly well taken, although it does overlook a couple of very important facts, one of which is that most of the Canadian population is in a very small area of the country. So those who are opposed to international comparisons tend to skew the comparisons by taking, you know, density across the whole country, and of course, even if you confine it to the border, there's still an issue of a country like the United Kingdom, which came up in the discussion yesterday.", "19351 But I think that in addition to that, there is a -- I think there's an issue if the comparisons are made strictly in terms of the outcome or the cost, I think there are also useful comparisons to be made in terms of what policies were initiated by governments, like South Korea, for example. And again, yes, extremely dense, probably more so than the United Kingdom. What policies were put in place by the government that had good policy outcomes? And obviously, density and cost and so on are a factor in that, but they're not the only factors.", "19352 And the one other thing that I would say is that especially because there are some folks who just don't want to hear about the, you know, the OACD, comparisons of speed and price, and so on. And I would suggest that some measurement, some comparisons are a lot better than none. They still provide guidance.", "19353 And if, to take the example of the OACD, since they have been doing their measurements for, I don't know what it is now, perhaps 8 or 10 years, there are trends that you can see, you can make comparisons from year to year, that I think are quite meaningful. Perhaps in some cases, more meaningful than just country-to\u2011country comparisons.", "19354 MS. TRIBE: I just wanted to add to build on David's point. It's important to look to other countries, and try and find examples and lessons that we can learn. And we do keep coming back to geography as this challenge that Canada faces, and I think this might be one issue where just need to lead and we need to figure out what works for us. And there might not be a solution elsewhere that we can completely compare ourselves to in terms of finding ways to move forward.", "19355 So I think this might be one case where we should embrace the fact that we're a pretty unique country. Josh has given lots of examples of ways that we're starting to work with that and around that for our own benefit, and I think that this could be a chance where, hopefully soon, other countries are actually looking to us for what they can do.", "19356 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "19357 I might be accused of being the one who asked how much does this cost, from time to time. And your answer regarding what is the cost of leaving Canadians behind is a question too, but that doesn't mean it's not a good question.", "19358 So what is the cost of leaving Canadians behind and what is the cost comparison of this and the cost to that?", "19359 MR. TABISH: I don't think you can put a price tag on leaving Canadians behind, which I know isn't the most helpful answer. But if we think about the experience of staying in touch with our friends and family, going back to school to skill up for jobs training, which is a major concern given the current economic climate, you know, access to information. I mean, the list goes on.", "19360 As somebody -- myself, speaking very personally for a second -- who grew up in a really small community, and my Internet connection was my connection to the outside world, I don't really want to put a price on that. Because that's what -- that was the start of what brought me here before you today, in my personal journey.", "19361 On the question of what will it cost, we answered this question or attempted to answer this question in our 2011 or '13 report, Connecting -- sorry, Casting an Open Net. We put a price on -- we put the price at 2.2 billion at the time.", "19362 I think that number needs to be revised, based on what I've heard throughout the course of this proceeding. And when I've looked at national broadband strategies and what the price tags on them are, I think that number is probably low.", "19363 But that number came from a consultation between our community and experts who regularly appear before you. People like Tamir Israel of CIPPIC and Christopher Parsons, and others.", "19364 So I don't have the magic number, but it's definitely in the -- it's in the billions and that's where federal support is going to be crucial.", "19365 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, it sounds like it's not -- and we had an odd synchronicity this morning between Quebecor and Bell. And your number is not that far off Bell's. So anyway, thank you very much.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "19366 MR. TABISH: That's terrifying for me.", "19367 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yeah, I know. I don't want to cause you a night's sleep on that, so -- anyway, thank you very much. Have a safe trip home.", "19368 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner Molnar?", "19369 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Good morning, barely morning.", "19370 I was pleased that you brought up the information deficit. Certainly, before and since this hearing occurred, I have been a bit concerned about literacy, and since this hearing occurred, I've also been concerned about the information deficity for what I would call community champions, and you mentioned it a little bit. So I want to talk to you about both of those.", "19371 You make the point that consumers really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting for speeds. I think we have an indication then when people are underserved they know that but they don\u2019t really know when they\u2019re overserved, and you make that point. They continue to sort of upgrade their services, and so on, not knowing really what they\u2019re getting or if they require it.", "19372 And I don\u2019t disagree with you at all, but I wonder, as it regards how to address that issue, I mean, first there is educating and informing Canadians about what -- you know, how the internet works, and what are their needs and so on, and I\u2019d like to get your sense as to who all should be playing in that field.", "19373 MS. TRIBE: I\u2019ll start us off. But I think that ---", "19374 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Yeah, let\u2019s talk about that first.", "19375 MS. TRIBE: --- we\u2019ll all have some answers on that one and some thoughts.", "19376 I think that the digital literacy is a huge concern, and I think that definitely is part of the CRTC\u2019s mandate to address.", "19377 I think, you know, when it comes to telecoms, it\u2019s complicated. The way that the systems work, the way that we\u2019re billed, are very complicated. What we have access to is very complex. ", "19378 And, you know, you\u2019re filled with a room of people who are either quite frustrated or quite excited about what\u2019s to come, or are experts in this field, but there are a number of people that are not here that don\u2019t know what access they have, what they\u2019re getting, what their package says. It\u2019s a lot of numbers. And they don\u2019t know how many megabytes they have to upload or download or what that means to them.", "19379 I would argue that the biggest challenge right now -- which I\u2019m sure David has a nice anecdote for you in his own experiences -- is that it is impossible to even find that information from our internet service providers right now. So even if you are trying to find out how much information you\u2019re using, how much you need, it\u2019s very difficult to find out what your package actually provides you with, and what you\u2019re using, and how that compares.", "19380 So I think there is a huge requirement for the service providers to actually be more transparent and open about what that -- what the services they\u2019re providing and what you\u2019re actually using and your needs are.", "19381 I would add that I also think that there is a roll for a larger education piece from the Commission that would both require them to do that but also provide those pieces to the public as well.", "19382 And I\u2019ll let David answer because I think David has some thoughts on this literacy piece as well.", "19383 MR. TABISH: My answer is short for once. I heard at some point in this hearing, and I don\u2019t remember who asked it so forgive me, but one of the Commissioner\u2019s asked literacy -- digital literacy is a problem of -- is a problem that could very easily be addressed -- or not easily, but is a problem that could be addressed by the education system, welfare services, social assistance, there\u2019s a variety of actors who have a role to play in that, and so, you know, speaking informally for a sec, who are we to barge in on that, or what role do we play.", "19384 And I think the insight there is those agencies, even educational institutions, are not experts on telecommunications, but you folks are, and they could use your help.", "19385 And I\u2019ll pass it over to David.", "19386 DR. ELLIS: I couldn\u2019t agree more, especially after the experiences that I\u2019ve had in the last 10 or 11 years in my teaching role.", "19387 But I would say something -- would like to say something about the role that the CRTC might play in this. And I appreciate that this is yet another responsibility that we sound like we\u2019d like to heap onto all the others. Your resources are limited. Staff expertise is limited. We\u2019re trying very hard not to make your job even harder.", "19388 But I think there\u2019s some things that the Commission can do in the short-term, short of, you know, launching an extension school out the back door. And if I may not be forgiven for saying something that may sound critical of the Commission, I think that a better job could be done of the current communication strategy with Canadians and the publication strategy. ", "19389 There has been a great deal more communication over the last three or four years, which is absolutely terrific, but there is some ways in which I think the Commission in trying to help Canadians understand what\u2019s going on better doesn\u2019t have a very clear sense of its audience.", "19390 And I\u2019ll take an example that we were discussing yesterday. If you look, say, in one of your communications monitoring reports, like the one from last fall, you will see text boxes that provide -- this is after, you know, you\u2019ve slogged through maybe 140 pages, what is a broadcasting distribution undertaking. Well, you know, my sense is that if you\u2019ve managed to read through that much of the CMR you probably don\u2019t need that kind of help, but there are other concepts, whether they have to do with broadcasting or telecommunications, that are not clear to Canadians and that some real effort could be put into trying to help them figure out what\u2019s going on.", "19391 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Okay. Well, I do think the information deficit is a very, very important issue, and I think -- you know, I will accept that our monitoring report has some acronyms in there, but I really think that Canadians -- you know, there\u2019s important issues about privacy, about security, about safe use and understanding, you know, as you pointed out here, what size of plan do I need, and so on. ", "19392 So, you know, we\u2019ll take away defining BDU but I really think there\u2019s really big issues around this and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been discussed, frankly, enough at this hearing.", "19393 Because once you empower Canadians I think a lot of this -- a lot of the rest could be possibly solved by the market. And I say that -- I\u2019ve been on this Commission for I guess as long as -- longer than anyone, and I\u2019ve gone through a number of hearings dealing with issues trying to enable greater competition in the market, and some of that\u2019s worked. And if I look at some of the players that are in the market and the tools they\u2019re providing and -- you know, I guess I\u2019ll just, you know, put the little hand out here to TekSavvy. I looked on their website and they have a really good tool to try and help a consumer find what kind of package they need based on how they use the internet and so on.", "19394 So do you think there\u2019s any possibility that we could focus on -- you know, focus priorities not just closing the gaps but rather than imposing some sort of basic pricing plan across the entire industry, helping to educate and inform consumers, enable and encourage competition, and let the market do that instead of us imposing pricing plans on the market? ", "19395 MR. TABISH: Well, in regard to your comments about the need for bridging that digital literacy gap and the role industry can play on that, to use the vernacular plus-one, that\u2019s great and we appreciate that a lot.", "19396 There\u2019s no doubt that industry could do better to inform their customers of how the stuff all works because it\u2019s complicated.", "19397 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Sorry, if I left you with the impression that I felt -- I did sort of challenge industry through this hearing as to whether or not they could lead it and, you know, I guess we all heard the answer they gave us.", "19398 MR. TABISH: Right.", "19399 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: So I was not suggesting that this be solely in the hands of industry.", "19400 MR. TABISH: Okay. I understand.", "19401 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: What I was suggesting is that if we were able to provide consumers with the knowledge to be empowered and informed and we focused our attention on creating a competitive market where there\u2019s choices, is that not a better solution or could that not be a solution.", "19402 MR. TABISH: Do you want to jump in?", "19403 MS. TRIBE: Sure. I\u2019ll go first. You can probably finish up.", "19404 I think that the digital literacy piece is a critical first step for that. And so your question is after that market forces would be sufficient, I think that\u2019s implying that the only reason market forces have been insufficient so far is because of a lack of digital literacy, and we just haven\u2019t seen that. So it would definitely help. ", "19405 I think that it would be a big step but it would help push consumers to put added pressure onto their service providers to increase the competition, but we haven\u2019t seen it work yet, and I think that it\u2019s unfair to imply that all of the pressure and responsibility for failed market forces around consumers for their lack of knowledge at this point.", "19406 So while we definitely think that that digital literacy piece is critical for the first step, we think that there is definitely a large role for the Commission to play in providing that immediate access in the meantime as well. So it's both.", "19407 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And if I could. I think it's unfair for you to say that I said that I'm going to blame this on consumers, because that is not at all what I said.", "19408 MS. TRIBE: No, sorry, I know. I apologize.", "19409 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: You gave that ---", "19410 MS. TRIBE: That's not what you meant.", "19411 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- statistics that said 80 percent are in the dark about their own service speeds.", "19412 So ---", "19413 MR. TABISH: We -- sorry, we understand ---", "19414 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: --- I do want to ---", "19415 MR. TABISH: We understand the distinction you were making there. We weren't meaning to put words in your mouth.", "19416 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: M'hm.", "19417 MR. TABISH: I apologize.", "19418 DR. ELLIS: I think also, Commissioner Molnar, that it might be useful to keep in mind that it's not really in the incumbents' DNA to be forthcoming with information.", "19419 One of the most startling things that came out of the experiment I did a few months ago, when 40 students did -- graded reports, ISP profiles. They had to assess their own service and then compare it to two competitive offers.", "19420 The single most compelling and shared observation that came out of that was that it is almost impossible to get a straightforward piece of information from the website, from the phone, or from a chat session, from any of the incumbents about anything to do with their service, unless it involves today's big discount -- sign up now so you don't lose out. This was a source of tremendous frustration.", "19421 And I'm pointing this out because I -- I mean, we've heard what the licensee said to you about this. It's disappointing, but I don't think that they're going to be pitching in and helping you out a great deal on this matter.", "19422 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: And that's very fair, and that's why I asked -- you know, there is a parallel focus here -- empower consumers and enable competition.", "19423 MR. TABISH: And we agree, and I just -- just to finish that thought.", "19424 One example that I gave in the video, which Commissioner MacDonald saw and mentioned, that community monitoring programs. So the initiative from CIRA around their Internet performance tool and helping empower communities to use open source -- open data technologies to understand what's going on, how does this stuff actually work, they've been doing tremendous work around that. And I applaud them for that as well as Professor McKelvey, who spoke at the beginning of this hearing, who helped push that forward.", "19425 That's the kind of initiative that the Commission could help bring to people, and that could be as easy as sharing it on your Twitter feeds and helping folks that way. We think that that -- if there was institutional support from experts like yourselves and this institution to help bring that to a wider audience, we would applaud that. That would be great.", "19426 And so there's people doing great work to bridge that literacy gap, and support for that is, I think, badly needed, as you've identified.", "19427 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: I have just one more question, as it regards data caps. And again, like I said, I've been around a long time. I know what was promised, and what they are, and we've identified that.", "19428 But particularly on satellite, where there truly is a high cost to capacity. And we've heard, you know, today, the environment is they do math, right. You can do speeds, you can do caps, you're trying to share this capacity as equitably as you can.", "19429 Would you say there may be a role for caps in certain situations, such as there where you truly have high cost constrained capacity?", "19430 MR. TABISH: So we were hoping you wouldn't ask that question. And my answer is a begrudging yes, not towards you but towards the question, of course.", "19431 Until that -- that technology has limitations, and until we get higher throughput satellites, low orbit satellites, we could understand that need. But it is definitely a problem that -- that scarcity of bandwidth is a huge problem for the North and will become an increasingly huge problem as more exploration happens, more people move into these communities, and usage becomes higher.", "19432 So yes, I -- like I guess my answer is, yeah, I guess. If that makes sense.", "19433 COMMISSIONER MOLNAR: Thanks. That's all I have.", "19434 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, but it doesn't always come out in the transcript but it did sound very reluctant.", "19435 Just a few last questions, and first of all, you know, you seem to be walking on eggs when you're commenting on our communication strategy. We're not that thin skinned. And it's something that, you know, we -- I certainly see it as a shared responsibility. So we have our part to do and so if there's any constructive ideas, very much appreciate it.", "19436 The reality is, this is the sort of thing that keeps me up at night, because you know, there's 450 commissioners and staff, so that means 1 of us for every 76,000 Canadians, or about. If -- and we do a lot. We use various corridors of communication. So we tend to use our Facebook for families and individuals and less complicated language. And then we're accused of being too simplistic.", "19437 And then when we use Twitter, we're accused of, oh, you know, only going to a certain group of people. And then I get up early and do a lot of radio -- there's a lot of radio stations in this country and I do a lot of those and early morning shows. And when we do faxes and our notices of public hearing, we're accused of being dinosaurs.", "19438 Anyway, there's ---", "19439 DR. ELLIS: I'm going to restore my Facebook account, then Mr. Chairman.", "19440 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah, so -- but we are conscious that there's various groups of people we try to communicate to, and one solution doesn't fit all, and we're always looking for constructive ideas. And so we welcome that.", "19441 DR. ELLIS: Thank you.", "19442 MR. TABISH: And we recognize that. We try to give you guy's credit for that where we can.", "19443 You are doing a much better job than previous -- this Commission is doing a much better job than the Commission has done in the past to engage Canadians. The stuff around Let's Talk TV has been great, and it's a constant struggle.", "19444 And when I was hearing your list, we actually have a lot in common, because we get the same thing from our community.", "19445 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right, and if we weren't criticized we wouldn't try to do better.", "19446 MR. TABISH: Exactly.", "19447 THE CHAIRPERSON: Help me understand what, in your view, is affordable?", "19448 Another one of those questions that you didn't want me to ask?", "19449 DR. ELLIS: We're all passing the buck.", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "19450 MR. TABISH: Yeah.", "19451 As we've heard for three weeks, the status quo is not affordable. This ---", "19452 THE CHAIRPERSON: So what's the status quo, then?", "19453 MR. TABISH: The present range of offerings in the market skews quite high for what Canadians feel they should be paying, and there's a number of indicators of this.", "19454 We've heard from disabilities groups. A powerful testimony from ACORN, MCC, others, they've given their -- they've talked to us about how affordability is hitting them. We've heard from more, let's call them typical users, about how affordability is impacting them.", "19455 What I think the answer is we see huge variation regionally. As you move across the country, you see the prices change quite a bit, whether you're in Halifax, or B.C., or Ontario, or Quebec, or the North.", "19456 And you know, what we want to see -- and that is why we've pushed this basic package. We want to try to bring some -- we want to try to draw a straight line through that scatterplot and find a base level that gives Canadians and Canadian businesses reassurance that no matter where they are in the country, where they want to operate, there is going to be something there for them. This could be new Canadians, this could be old Canadians, this could be whoever.", "19457 And so what we're trying to identify is a national floor for what affordability looks like, and what we're saying is that has to be lower than the cluster that we see. Because as David pointed out, and I'll ask him to comment more on this, but -- if he's willing -- but what we see is a lack of those low cost options. It's just the variation there is not high enough. So we need to see that bridge gapped descriptively in the market. Yeah.", "19458 DR. ELLIS: Mr. Chairman, I would just add to that, the item that Josh was just mentioning about the disappearance of low cost options. This is a pretty well established pattern that I just mentioned for a few seconds in the opening presentation. Whereby as broadband penetration increases and it becomes more and more like an essential service, the providers are able to charge higher and higher prices and they don\u2019t need to depend on a wide range of prices to keep market share away from their competitors. ", "19459 So there\u2019s no doubt that part of the problem that we\u2019re facing is that quite apart from how you look at eligible Canadians or Canadians that are being disadvantaged, there is a serious structural problem in that the low-cost options have disappeared. And this is a phenomenon that I understand is quite well known to economists.", "19460 But I think that there\u2019s another side to this as well to go back to Commissioner Molnar\u2019s point about the information deficit. Affordability, to me, has to do with being able to make, not necessarily rational, but well-founded or informed decisions. Should I take plan A or should I take plan B? And it\u2019s very often difficult for the average consumer to realize that if they take the cheaper option and just behave the way they\u2019ve always behaved online, they\u2019re going to end up paying more because they\u2019re going to go over their cap and the $50 service turns into a $100 service.", "19461 And I mean, I don\u2019t want to flog this horse too much, but I think there\u2019s something in what Commissioner Molnar has said that would be helpful. Of course, not to the exclusion of all of the other things that need to be done.", "19462 THE CHAIRPERSON: Would you be open to -- I noticed you put the point that there\u2019s very important regional distinctions. But would you agree that there may be actual objective geography technology reasons why affordability may be defined differently in different parts of the country? And the most extreme case perhaps is in the north. Would you agree with that?", "19463 MR. TABISH: So I think, as others have said, the north is definitely a special case. It has a variety of factors that distinguish it.", "19464 I think the question of, in the remaining provinces, where what should the expectation be around affordability. And I think there\u2019s a significant structural problem. I think insufficient choice in the market is what\u2019s rendering this issue. And we see this too, I should say, in the wireless sector it\u2019s very pronounced. The way the price varies.", "19465 And so, you know, our call in the big picture is to move towards a service-based model. We -- for example, I\u2019m sure the Commissioners are aware that we\u2019ve been a bit stuck on this whole mandating MVNO thing for a while now. And ---", "19466 THE CHAIRPERSON: I may have seen that.", "19467 MR. TABISH: And because the -- we -- the lesson in the wireless sector is -- for end users is companies that are expected to come in and build their own facilities it hasn\u2019t worked so well. ", "19468 And so what we\u2019re hoping to see is new national providers that can fill those niches, can fill the need for those low-cost options. MVNOs are very well positioned to do that.", "19469 And the metaphor extends, of course, to the wireline sector. Open access on networks would allow for new national providers to come in.", "19470 I make this point occasionally in interviews but, for example, rollover billing would be a startling revelation in Canada for end users. And that\u2019s exactly the type of thing something like Ting or Google\u2019s Project Fi or FreedomPop or a public wireless are itching to do.", "19471 And so I think the answer is, to get at affordability we need greater choice. That\u2019s what Canadians want. And I think a national strategy to do that is the best way to address that so that there is some equalling out --", "19472 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "19473 MR. TABISH: -- across the existing infrastructure.", "19474 THE CHAIRPERSON: But I did hear you admit that maybe in satellite delivered communities that might be an exceptional case.", "19475 MR. TABISH: Yeah, the competition factor there is pretty huge.", "19476 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "19477 MR. TABISH: And so we definitely need public interest regulation to ensure that their needs are still met, but it\u2019s a special case.", "19478 THE CHAIRPERSON: I\u2019m always afraid when we start doing international comparisons we go down rabbit holes. I mean, sometimes people come to this hearing with experts with -- that say, well, you know, this foreign jurisdiction does it this way and then we end up having to have a little inquiry as to well, how different or not different is the regulatory regime in that country or not. And just to build on what the Vice-Chair was asking you, I mean, you answered, you know, Scandinavia might be a comparable. Does your Scandinavia include Norway and Iceland?", "19479 MR. TABISH: Allow me to rephrase my answer.", "19480 If we look at -- and thank you for that opportunity. Where we look at -- so okay. So when we look around the world we see markets that have embraced open access are selling faster services at lower prices and quality is higher and people are happy. And there\u2019s some examples in Asia. Japan -- I don\u2019t know if they mandated access to fibre but they had open access provisions early in their history of deploying fibre. The same thing can be seen across kind of old Europe. That is where we see -- those are the -- that\u2019s the model we\u2019re looking for.", "19481 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right.", "19482 MR. TABISH: Yeah.", "19483 THE CHAIRPERSON: From a pure objective analysis, I saw your table, the OECD table there. To my knowledge, that just does retail price; is that correct?", "19484 DR. ELLIS: Yes, that\u2019s my understanding.", "19485 THE CHAIRPERSON: So it doesn\u2019t really take into consideration implicit or explicit subsidies that may otherwise affect what the retail price is; does it?", "19486 DR. ELLIS: I think that\u2019s true. And of course, if wholesale prices are high in one jurisdiction and low in another, that skews the comparison.", "19487 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. So if you were going to do a -- and I\u2019m not suggesting that this is an avenue because it does seem like a bit of a rabbit hole, but scientifically, if you\u2019re going to compare you got to compare the whole thing. And there\u2019s a lot of things -- like if you pay less because somehow there\u2019s a government subsidy or regulatory subsidy, it\u2019s like comparing apples to watermelons; is it not?", "19488 MR. TABISH: There\u2019s an insight there that is helpful though, which is that as Professor Winseck pointed out, the subsidy that Canadians are paying for broadband development is actually quite low. And one of the questions in the present proceeding is should we do something to help that. And so I see that opportunity -- I think that insight is useful for our discussion.", "19489 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Thank you very much for your presentation. Those are our questions.", "19490 And I do want to thank you. You do bring people to our hearing and that\u2019s a very good thing. And ---", "19491 MR. TABISH: On the last day especially, it\u2019s a ---", "19492 THE CHAIRPERSON: No, well, not just for that. I mean, I think you do bring a generational change to those that attend our hearing. And I think that can nothing be but positive for the work we do. Doesn\u2019t mean we agree with everything, but it certainly is a positive. So thank you very much for ---", "19493 MR. TABISH: Thank you very much. We appreciate your time and questions.", "19494 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. In the hope of trying to finish the last presenter, Madam Secretary, could you ask the next intervenor to come forward?", "19495 THE SECRETARY: I will now ask the Canadian Network Operators Consortium to come to the presentation table.", "19496 THE CHAIRPERSON: So welcome. Just so you know, what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll hear your presentation and I think I\u2019m -- we\u2019ll do at least a short health break right after that, at the very least, if that\u2019s okay with you. So please identify your panel and we\u2019re listening to you.", "PRESENTATION", "19497 MR. SANDIFORD: Try this one.", "19498 MR. TACIT: Yeah, mine isn\u2019t ---", "19499 MR. SANDIFORD: Use this one, Chris.", "19500 MR. TACIT: So I guess I can actually say good afternoon as the notes require me to do.", "19501 Mr. Chair and Commissioners, my name is Christian Tacit. I\u2019m counsel to CNOC. Seated to my right is William Sandiford, Chair of the Board and President of CNOC, and seated to his right is Christopher Hickey, CNOC\u2019s Director of Industry Affairs. Seated to my left is Lynne Hamilton, Government Relations Consultant to CNOC and National Chair of Equal Voice.", "19502 Mr. Sandiford will start our opening statement.", "19503 MR. SANDIFORD: Thank you, Chris.", "19504 Mr. Chair, in the statement that you made on April 18", "th", " you challenged participants in this proceeding to address a number of specific issues.", "19505 The first one is where there are gaps in broadband connectivity. These gaps can relate to geographic access, technological attributes, economic access and affordability and digital literacy.", "19506 You also challenged us to consider strategies for closing these gaps and to identify the parties best placed to assist with each area. ", "19507 We are structuring our submission today to address these issues.", "19508 As someone who has led a company involved in the rollout of broadband infrastructure in rural areas, I find the opportunities presented by this proceeding to be very promising.", "19509 Mr. Hickey will take it from here.", "19510 MR. HICKEY: Thank you, Bill.", "19511 In my part of the presentation, I am going to identify gaps in broadband access connectivity according to the four categories identified by the Chair. I will then put forward some approaches for closing the gaps.", "19512 No one disagrees that broadband access is fundamentally important to the lives of Canadians. However, we believe that setting appropriate speed targets is crucial to the elimination of connectivity gaps.", "19513 We have listened carefully to the evidence in this proceeding and are of the view that a minimum speed target of 10/3 megabits per second is required in order to enable participation in the digital life of Canada now and over the next few years.", "19514 A 10/3 speed target will also ensure that any access facilities that are subsidized as a means of meeting the target speed requirement would be capable of scaling to provide greater speeds. We do not want to see a situation where subsidized facilities, such as pure copper, become obsolete requiring duplicate investments later on. From a practical perspective, this means prioritising the rollout of FTTN and FTTP, followed by fixed wireless and lastly, satellite.", "19515 But even more is required. In order for the applications of today and tomorrow to function as intended, targets should also exist for other attributes such as availability, latency, jitter, packet loss and data caps. ", "19516 Getting a handle on these targets for these attributes is more difficult since doing so depends on complex technical considerations. As a result, we do not believe the record of this proceeding is sufficiently well developed to determine specific targets at this time. However, we believe that the Commission should confirm that setting targets for these QoS measures is important. It should then use the regulatory tools at its disposal, such as CISC or the ability to appoint an inquiry officer, to study these technical issues further and make specific evidence-based determinations.", "19517 The Commission\u2019s initiative to develop maps showing connectivity gaps is a very important tool for narrowing the gaps. ", "19518 We urge the Commission to supplement this work through the mapping of available transport facilities on a nation-wide basis in order to ensure that the lack of discoverability of transport facilities does not become an unnecessary roadblock to the competitive rollout of broadband connectivity in Canada.", "19519 We also recommend a review of the forbearance regime related to transport facilities. This would remove any roadblocks to connectivity that may be present as a result of excessive pricing of such facilities due to insufficient competition.", "19520 Finally, we reiterate the request we have made in this proceeding for a transport subsidy applicable to the operating territory of Northwestel that is accessible to all carriers. The mechanism should subsidize the transport costs in Northwestel\u2019s territory that exceed comparable costs for transport facilities in Southern Canada. This subsidy mechanism would replace all other Commission approved subsidies in this territory. ", "19521 It is only through the deployment of such subsidies that CNOC members, such as Iristel and its affiliate Ice Wireless, which have built their Northern infrastructure without any subsidies, will be able to continue to bring the benefits of competition to the Canadian North.", "19522 We believe that the best way to remove economic barriers to connectivity is through competition. It is competition that leads to lower pricing and service innovations that benefit consumers. This means that the Commission must remain vigilant and ensure that the framework for regulated wholesale high-speed access and related services remains robust.", "19523 As such, access to the subsidized facilities used to provide broadband internet services should be available to competitors on a mandated wholesale basis. However, in order to not burden small service providers with the complexity of wholesale obligations and regulations, this requirement would only apply to service providers that serve a number of locations over a specific threshold using their own access facilities.", "19524 Affordability of broadband service is an important issue and one that needs to be addressed. Many CNOC members are contributing to the increased affordability of services. They do so by offering services at prices that are significantly lower than those of the incumbents every day. However, we do not think that the broader affordability problem can be solved through Commission intervention without the creation of significant economic distortion in retail markets.", "19525 For this reason, we do not believe that a contribution levy or a skinny internet package are the appropriate vehicles for addressing affordability concerns. On this note, it would not be economically feasible for independent ISPs to offer a skinny internet package under the existing pricing of underlying regulated wholesale facilities. The appropriate authority and expertise for addressing affordability issues rests with provincial and territorial governments that deliver social assistance programs.", "19526 We do have two further recommendations for promoting competition without creating unwanted economic distortions.", "19527 First, we believe that the construction of broadband networks in unserved and underserved areas should not be funded by a levy that applies to the closed system of TSPs that the Commission does or can regulate. Instead these projects should be funded by the federal government with appropriate input from the Commission, as Lynne will discuss in a few minutes.", "19528 Second, we are asking that the Commission replace the current contribution threshold with an across the board exemption for the first $10 million in contribution eligible revenues for all TSPs. This approach will place TSPs of all sizes on equal footing with respect to the obligation to contribute to the National Contribution Fund. This modification should apply without regard to whether the Commission decides to apply the contribution regime to broadband services as well. We also think that it is time for the threshold to be increased to $15 million and that it should be further reviewed every five years.", "19529 Making broadband a basic service to ensure ubiquitous availability of connectivity is one important step towards promoting digital literacy. After all, if connectivity is not available, the need for digital literacy becomes largely moot. In addition, the Commission could have an important role in promoting digital literacy objectives by encouraging public discourse and promoting relevant resources more readily available.", "19530 Fundamentally though, we believe that the delivery of programs aimed at increasing digital literacy is the responsibility of provincial and territorial governments. Such programs are best delivered locally, for example, in schools, community centres and retirement homes.", "19531 I will now turn the presentation over to Ms. Hamilton.", "19532 MS. HAMILTON: Thank you, Christopher.", "19533 A national broadband strategy cannot develop in a vacuum. We believe that to be successful the federal government, the Commission, industry and other interested parties need to collaborate. ", "19534 I am going to spend a few minutes discussing how various stakeholders could work together and what they bring to the table in terms of closing the broadband access gaps.", "19535 The federal government has the responsibility, resources and the authority to develop a national broadband strategy. That strategy must include a program to fund the rollout of broadband facilities in unserved and underserviced parts of Canada. The government also has the taxing power necessary to spread the very significant funding required for such a program across the entire Canadian tax base over a number of years.", "19536 First Nations, provincial governments and municipalities also have the capacity to make contributions to programs designed to improve broadband infrastructure and to deliver digital literacy and skills training.", "19537 For its part, the Commission has significant means at its disposal to collect, analyze and obtain public input on the data that\u2019s critical for the formation, by the Federal Government, of a comprehensive national broadband funding program. The Commission\u2019s regulatory arsenal for performing these tasks include the ability to solicit submissions, issue RFIs, appoint Inquiry Officers and hold public hearings.", "19538 The Commission also has the ability to create and oversee an entity similar to the Canadian Telecommunications Contribution Consortium to implement, at arm\u2019s length, an evidence-based funding model for large scale and regional projects. Now subject to the appropriate legislative amendments, the Commission could be tasked to do this. Other orders of government could also choose to contribute funding for these types of projects that benefit their particular jurisdictions.", "19539 ISPs can apply their expertise, capital and other resources to deploy and improve broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved parts of Canada, but in order to do this, we need the support for this type of national broadband infrastructure program. CNOC members are very conscious of the need for affordable and innovative services to be delivered to Canadians every day. It\u2019s why we exist.", "19540 We urge the Commission and the Federal Government to begin a dialog on how they can work together to create this kind of program. Input from other stakeholders such as provincial, territorial and municipal governments, as well as First Nations, will be crucial to the success of this approach.", "19541 I\u2019ll now pass it back to Mr. Tacit.", "19542 MR. TACIT: Thank you, Lynne.", "19543 This concludes our presentation. Thank you for your attention. We\u2019ll be pleased to answer your questions.", "19544 THE CHAIRPERSON: Great, thank you. ", "19545 I\u2019m told that we only need seven minutes, so let\u2019s take a 12-minute -- so we will be back at 12:37 for the question period, if that\u2019s okay?", "--- Upon recessing at 12:30 p.m.", "--- Upon resuming at 12:39 p.m.", "19546 THE SECRETARY: Please take your seats.", "19547 LE PR\u00c9SIDENT: \u00c0 l\u2019ordre, s'il vous pla\u00eet.", "19548 Thanks for that break. And Commissioner -- Vice-Chair Menzies will be asking you questions to start us off.", "19549 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Good morning.", "19550 MR. TACIT: Good morning.", "19551 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I thought we\u2019d start with your presentation from today. In terms of the 10 and 3 target, you -- I\u2019d like you just to unpack that a little more as to why that -- how you came to that number and -- yes. And you can address also in there in terms of the upload. It\u2019s been raised -- it\u2019s been -- in response to questions, it\u2019s been indicated from others that that\u2019s a challenge.", "19552 MR. TACIT: Sure, we\u2019ll ask Mr. Hickey to start.", "19553 MR. HICKEY: Thank you, Chris. So with respect to the 10 itself, the -- we\u2019re not of -- we\u2019re not of the view that 5 today is sufficient. And so in interrogatories and questions we were reviewing and it came through that to ensure that any subsidized facilities aren\u2019t deployed. There was a Bell interrogatory response that said that would require 10 meg to ensure things like copper and straight copper aren\u2019t been deployed.", "19554 And so we looked at that and effectively said, okay, it needs to be more than 5, if we have to do a base minimum, that falls also within our category of the services have to be upgradable to be able to meet faster speeds in the future, then that becomes basically a 10-meg floor, to our understanding.", "19555 And the 3 megabit itself was due to basically building in some overhead. And so today you get 5/1 services that are in many ways 5/800. And when you look at, you know, video relay service requirements that require 1/3, and videoconferencing and things like that that are going to continue to increase, we want to make sure we build in a little bit of overhead so your 10/2 isn't 10/1, and then not sufficient to actually meet the uploading requirements for the applications currently in the markets and will be introduced as we move forward down this path.", "19556 MR. TACIT: And I just want to add one thing to that, and that is we recognize that the programs we\u2019re talking about, regardless of whose estimates you believe that have been before you, involves a tremendous amount of money. And what we don\u2019t want to do is have a program -- and especially given the nature of regulatory lag and the difficulty of getting government funding -- where we have a partial solution, and then in two to three years we find that it really hasn\u2019t solved the problem and we\u2019re right back at square one. We want to be a little more forward-looking than that.", "19557 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, I prefer the term regulatory latency.", "---(LAUGHTER)", "19558 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: But just a bit more, please, on why -- I mean lots of people have come here and said 5 covers all the basic needs that people have, they can have streaming video. I mean it was indicated by many folks that it\u2019s more data caps than speed, they can get access to basic government services and all that sort of thing. And I -- why did you -- why do you see 5 as insufficient? Why are they wrong, in other words?", "19559 MR. HICKEY: Well in many ways I think it comes back to what Chris was talking about. So if we accepted that it was 5, and we deploy subsidies and everything to meet this 5 targets, and we\u2019re all striving towards this 5 targets, and 2020 comes and we\u2019ve checked that box. Then the next time we have this hearing it\u2019s going to say, \u201cWell now it\u2019s 25, now it\u2019s 50.\u201d And all the infrastructure we put in place to get us to 5, now we have to upgrade that and then go forward.", "19560 So it\u2019s more from a forward-looking approach that says that, you know, in searching ways for multi-household use, there's a couple better uses for things like 10 compared to 5, but it\u2019s really from a forward-looking approach to ensure that we\u2019re not being wasteful towards our approach when we have to use things like subsidies to meet a goal.", "19561 MR. TACIT: From a technological perspective too there's an inflection point at 5, and that is that\u2019s where you go from -- for example, if you're in the copper world, from pure copper to FTTN and then FTTP, once you go there you can do 10, you can do 25, you can do 50. And if you\u2019ve got FTTP you can do 100. ", "19562 So the point is, do we want to incent people to take subsidies to build basic copper loops? Is that what we want to do in the 21", "st", " century by setting a target of 5? So we can have a program that would be very successful at doing that, but then what happens the year after?", "19563 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. I guess that opens the door to what would be the point in setting 10 when -- I said is funding 5? But we can get into that a little bit later in -- and when we talk about some -- some other things.", "19564 In that paragraph 13 of your oral remarks it says, \u201cFrom a practical perspective, this means prioritizing the rollout of FTTN and FTTP followed by fixed wireless and lastly, satellite.\u201d So where to? Just to give me some idea of where you're talking about when you say the rollout of fibre. Is that -- are those progressive, fibre first, then at the end of that road comes fixed wireless, and at the end of that road it's all aerial, satellite?", "19565 MR. TACIT: So the notion there is that if there's an area that can be built out practically, economically using fibre, that\u2019s the technology that\u2019s preferable because it\u2019s the most robust, it\u2019s the most -- it\u2019s the one that will give you the most long-term benefits. ", "19566 Fibre essentially has capacity only limited by the electronics that you put on the ends of it. And as the electronics improve and the productivity of those electronics improve, as we\u2019ve seen it\u2019s happened over the last few decades, you're going to get more and more capacity. ", "19567 If in a spot -- if in an area its nature is such that it is not practicable to put in fibre, then you would go to fixed wireless. And only as a last resort would one use -- would one rely on satellite. So it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a model that prefers certain solutions over others because of the funding component. You're trying to get the best leverage for the funds you spend.", "19568 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. You can correct me, but the way I see it is a upload speed of 3 more or less requires fibre, so you're setting that. So you're setting a target that\u2019s going to incent fibre builds, but then you're also going to be at the end of that road having fixed wireless providers and satellite providers unable to meet that standard. ", "19569 So would you foresee a technology-agnostic series of targets in that regard? Or would you be afraid that that would, you know, if you said 10 and 3 for -- 10 and 3 generally in areas where only fixed wireless can be provided 10 and 1 or satellite 5 and 1, what are we talking about here?", "19570 MR. HICKEY: Yeah, I think our approach is, effectively, we\u2019re going to have to face the realities that we face difficult and change in circumstances in different areas across the country. ", "19571 And in our intervention we had talked about the fact that we may need to look at the reality that we\u2019ll have to set a specific target in places that are very remote and hard to reach, and a separate target in places that don\u2019t share those characteristics. ", "19572 And our point there is that, effectively, yes, if you have an area that\u2019s more accessible and can meet FTTP deployments, we want to make sure whatever goal we set is high enough to be ambitious for that deployment. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can necessarily say that, in this very remote place that is impossible to get FTTP to, has to have those same exact service characteristics as those more accessible locations. ", "19573 And so there you may say, due to that, we have to make sure they\u2019re connected and give them the best connectivity possible. But in this area, due to these constraints, that may look different than this area where those constraints don\u2019t exist.", "19574 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: In terms of -- in paragraph 15 of your oral remarks, it\u2019s -- you list these other attributes: availability, latency, jitter, packet loss and data caps. And I\u2019m a little surprised that you said that this is difficult -- getting a handle on targets for these attributes is more difficult because it -- others have been able to give us a ballpark number on, for instance, latency. Data caps, at least a couple of parties have said there just shouldn\u2019t be any. And others have said like 25, things like that.", "19575 So with all your expertise and speaking of regulatory latency, why this big process in here as opposed to at least giving us something that we could call an interim position or a preliminary view on these things?", "19576 MR. HICKEY: I think that\u2019s fair. I think where we came from this is following up on the last question was that we may be facing a solution that includes various technologies, satellites, fixed wireless and FTTP and wireline solutions. And so with that, you know, we want to make sure that whatever target we set is also achievable by all facilities or you need distinct targets there. And I think that\u2019s where the -- this target should apply needs to be strongly considered to make sure whatever target\u2019s set, if it\u2019s a uniform target, can be met by everyone.", "19577 I mean, oftentimes we look at the basic of, you know, what\u2019s required to support VoIP or video conferencing. And if you take that as a bare bones, you know yes, we can propose 100 to 150 milliseconds of latency, less than 30 milliseconds of jitter, and packet loss less than 1 percent. But before we just -- I guess our thought was before we blindly just say that should be it, we need to make sure that setting those can be also achieved by the various technologies that will have to play a role in achieving the solution to the issue that we\u2019re facing.", "19578 MR. TACIT: I think the other thing is we did have some evidence on the record of the proceeding that showed that these things are problematic to pin down, that they\u2019re somewhat depend on the types of services you want to provide. And also, that some of them can be affected by end user equipment and behaviour. So they\u2019re not quite as straightforward.", "19579 So in terms of getting a more precise handle on them, I think we do need a further process. I remember we posed interrogatories to all of the incumbents on what they thought these things were and we couldn\u2019t get a straight answer. And, you know, we queried our own members and had trouble coming to any kind of consensus on it.", "19580 So that told me this is an area that requires some further investigation. I don\u2019t have an objection to some interim targets based on what\u2019s here. But I think that if we want to get, again, a longer term solution, we need to do a little bit more work in this area.", "19581 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So there are areas like that where we could at least state aspirations to be checked against reality?", "19582 MR. TACIT: Sure.", "19583 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. Okay. ", "19584 When you talk about the -- in paragraph 17 the maps, and you say \u201cthe mapping of available transport facilities on a nation-wide basis in order to ensure the lack of discoverability of transport facilities does not become an unnecessary roadblock,\u201d that issue came up at some point. A little bit of a blur now, but the -- there was some acceptance by one of the larger companies that that wasn\u2019t so much an issue getting that information out. But there were also issues regarding confidentiality and security that people don\u2019t necessarily want to publicize where their fibre\u2019s running for those who are inclined to mischief and more nefarious ambitions.", "19585 MR. TACIT: So a simple solution to that would be that those maps would only be accessible to those who are registered with the Commission as carriers providing certain types of services. There is already that sort of check for certain types of data that\u2019s out there right now. And I don\u2019t see why that -- those concerns which are quite legitimate couldn\u2019t be addressed in that way. I mean, I\u2019m not suggesting we just post this on the website or anything.", "19586 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Good. Just wanted to make that clear.", "19587 The review of the forbearance regime, is that similar to the ask that came from the joint task force?", "19588 MR. TACIT: It\u2019s similar to the ask that came from TekSavvy, I know, because they were --", "19589 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay.", "19590 MR. TACIT: -- first to talk about this.", "19591 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. I believe it\u2019s the same -- we\u2019re discussing the same issue there. Somebody can correct me later I\u2019m sure if that\u2019s not the case.", "19592 Moving forward, affordability. Looking at paragraph 22. You say your members advanced the cause of affordability, more or less, because they offer prices that are significantly lower than those of the incumbents. How much lower? How do your prices compare with the incumbent\u2019s?", "19593 MR. TACIT: It\u2019s actually in Exhibit 4, I think.", "19594 MR. HICKEY: Yeah, I won\u2019t pull out a couple, but in the -- I\u2019ll pull out just a couple from the Commission\u2019s exhibit that I put forward on this proceeding.", "19595 The -- if you take a [", "sic", "] area like Toronto and you\u2019re looking at the 5/1 that was detailed in the exhibits, you have our member TekSavvy 24.95 for 150 gig. You have Execulink at 29.995 for 100 gig. You have Distributel for 36.95 for unlimited. You have Bell at 42.95 with a question mark because the data cap isn\u2019t listed. And you have Rogers at 54.99 for 60 gig. And so if you look at TekSavvy to Rogers, you\u2019re looking at a substantial difference.", "19596 Though it doesn\u2019t just stop in purely urban areas like Toronto. If you go to Halifax it lists, for example, TekSavvy is a 41.95 products versus -- for unlimited at versus Bell 76.45 products for unlimited, also for 5 to 1 services.", "19597 So you see that across the board in many ways. And the -- we think that is significant savings and everyday pricing. So these are also just not promotional. That\u2019s everyday website pricing.", "19598 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right. So I was thinking about that in terms of some of the folks we saw a couple weeks ago from the ACORN group and that sort of stuff. Some had -- were talking and their Internet prices were much higher than those were available. And in some of the places they were from your members have service. ", "19599 So is that a market -- just a, what do you call it, a discoverability issue? Is that -- because it seems to me that some of the groups that work with these people in their troubles, it would be useful to them if they could direct them to people who -- at least a list. I mean, it can\u2019t be agents on your behalf, but they could at least direct people to a list of more affordable service providers.", "19600 MR. TACIT: So that\u2019s certainly true and maybe there is a way that we could do that. Certainly, you know, one thing that could be done so as to make it commercially neutral, for example, is the Commission could have links based on its resell -- some of its resellers lists to the various sites of competitors, and then let people just look through that. Promote it as a separate list from the registration list to say these are -- if you\u2019re interested in any of the companies that are on our list, here are the websites and people can find. So in terms of discoverability, that's just one thought that comes to mind.", "19601 But the other is just the ongoing role of competition to help push out this pricing, you know, nationwide. And you've been doing great work as a Commission on that, and we're getting there, but that's really one of the major steps that needs to be pursued.", "19602 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You're the second person today who said we're doing great work. That makes me happy. Thank you.", "19603 The -- I don't want -- I don't think I want to get into this point, but I do want to confirm in paragraph 23 when you're talking about a skinny Internet package is not reasonable. That would have to do with wholesale rates; is that what you're saying there?", "19604 MR. TACIT: I think for a whole host of reasons. Wholesale rates is just one. The other is we think that that would -- could potentially lead to a need for sort of service providers to start trying to cross-subsidize and increasing prices for other packages. We just don't think that that's an efficient way to address affordability.", "19605 When you look at affordability, you have to consider that affordability has as much to do with people's income as it does with the prices of the goods and services they buy. A single mother in Toronto holding down two jobs, two part time jobs with a couple of kids, may not be able to afford a $30 or $40 package. Somebody with a family of four in Northern Ontario, whose cost of living may be higher but who have much lower housing costs, for example, and have a full time job, may be able to afford it.", "19606 So to have this broad spread solution to affordability is very economically inefficient, in addition to having a real problem based on current wholesale rates. So it's both of those reasons that lead us down this path.", "19607 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Cybera suggested to us yesterday that we should be engaged in regulating retail rates.", "19608 MR. TACIT: I think that ship is past, and rightly so. I think if we're going to have a competitive retail market, we need to have a competitive retail market.", "19609 I think the Commission's been wise to focus on access issues and to make wholesale access reasonable and as open as possible with all of the various balancing considerations that are brought to bear with that.", "19610 And we accept that and we participate in that exercise on an ongoing basis, as you know. But I think if you're going to make that choice, you know, unless there's a particular area where you've got a monopoly situation, you know, really retail forbearance is the way to go generally.", "19611 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, when you suggest in paragraph 27 that the threshold be increased from $10 million to $15 million in terms of that. I think you need to justify that. That's -- I mean, if we're all in this together, right, we should all be in this together. And that's a big jump.", "19612 MR. HICKEY: So to clarify, are you talking the changing from a threshold to an exemption, or the 15 -- the jump from 10 to 15?", "19613 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: The jump from 10 to 15.", "19614 MR. HICKEY: So, you know, when we set out to do this, we had looked at -- and so I just want to clarify where this comes from a little bit.", "19615 So when we have a small and growing service provider that today passes the $10 million threshold and starts to pay into contribution, we don't have a ramp up process. It's you were $9.99 million one year, and now you're over 10 and you're in the system. And that's not a bad thing. It's not the issue of our members not looking to contribute.", "19616 But with a couple examples from the RFI that was given. You know, a competitor that just breaches 11 million and has 3 million of intercarrier expenses or terminal equipment revenues, will owe 44,000 on those revenues, which for a growing service provider could mean a salary, could mean a piece of equipment, or another important need that wasn't there one year and is there the next. So that's one of our concerns with the contribution regime as it is, it's the just the no ramp up.", "19617 So when we were looking at it, we went back to 20 -- 2,745 and we said, well, what was the original $10 million threshold established based on. So at that time, it was effectively administrative efficiency and to ensure that providers can earn enough revenues before being required to contribute.", "19618 And if you do the math, at that time the sufficient revenues was basically .032 percent of the total telecom revenues in the market. So in 2000, it was 31 billion of total telecom revenues, and at 10 million of a threshold that would be .032 percent was considered sufficient revenues before you start to contribute.", "19619 So all we did was we took that and we scaled it. We said today, the market's 45.9 billion, .032 percent of that market brings us to 15 million. You can get a similar outcome if you use inflation that's occurred; 31.72 percent is your inflation from 2000 to 20 -- current period, and that would get you a little less at around 13 million. But you can do those types of measures to kind of scale up what was considered at that time and making it modern based on the changing conditions.", "19620 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, thank you.", "19621 Ms. Hamilton, I think this is probably for you, in terms of your remarks.", "19622 I need you to sort of take us through the steps as to how this might happen in terms of what you outline here. You know, something more specifically in terms of, I mean, who leads this process? What is industry's involvement? Is it similar to what Roger's outlined? A sort of national advisory panel for a couple of years and -- to get everyone coordinated and not to drag things out and end up just sort of disappearing into a single point of light eventually.", "19623 But how do we advance that? How quickly does that happen? Who chairs the first meeting? That sort of thing.", "19624 MS. HAMILTON: Essentially, we see it functioning very similarly to the Canadian Telecommunications Contribution Consortium, where you would have industry players at the table. You'd also bring governments in...", "19625 Basically, it's a discussion that needs to happen first between you and the Federal Government. How do you want to move forward? How do we put the structure in place so that essentially a lot of the technical stuff is ironed out?", "19626 And then essentially this is just a neutral third party arm's length funding organization that is fairly neutral in terms of it's taking it out of government, necessarily. So those decisions that can sometimes be made in minister's offices and other places, and just take it to the CRTC at an arm's length level, where they would be making funding decisions based on technology and based on just the economics of it. They would be pretty much down to price at that point. And based on need.", "19627 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Right.", "19628 Just so we're not talking at cross-purposes.", "19629 This is all part of the development of a national broadband strategy that we're talking about? And I just kind of want to make sure that -- I mean, obviously, all these -- some of the others have discussed, and you mention it too.", "19630 I mean, we have us, the Federal Government, provincial governments in some cases, civic, municipal governments, and I would think industry. And I think it would probably -- or as some have suggested, let me put it that way, that it would be most -- would be very useful to have industrial leaders within that sort of thing.", "19631 So is that sort of Roger's-Bell-style, the sort of models they throw out, or are you talking about something significantly different?", "19632 MS. HAMILTON: This would be more CRTC-driven at an arm's length level, where they would have input, as would the governments at the onset. When they were putting the project together, taking more a full-scale approach as opposed to, okay, so what are we going to be in for, how much money are we going to be looking at, who is going to be putting money into the pot, who is going to look after this.", "19633 Like having that conversation right now, we couldn't be at a more pivotal time, where this government is, where you guys are, to bring the partners together to have a discussion led by the CRTC and figure out how we need to move forward. Industry will come to the table. We're ready, willing, able. We've got the partners that are ready to jump in.", "19634 You've got a funding pocket of money for about $500 million on the table right now. How do they want to move forward with that? Have that conversation first, and then basically, once it comes down to the actual nuts and bolts of who's going to disseminate that money, it'll largely just come down to technology and price.", "19635 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, that would need -- that would require some significant partnership in a sense with -- might not be the right word but with industry, because for an organisation such as ours to lead, I mean our historical relationship as you are aware, with parliament is not one in which we tell them what to do. ", "19636 So it would need some -- we can advise, we can make suggestions, but they are parliament and we are not, in that sense.", "19637 So, okay I guess that would ---", "19638 MS. HAMILTON: Through their legislative authorities they\u2019re going to have to disseminate the power for you to be able to do this. You are absolutely correct.", "19639 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Yes, okay, thanks. ", "19640 MR. TACIT: So if I could just clarify a couple of things there? ", "19641 First in terms of the steps, I think what\u2019s envisioned is first have a dialog between the government and the CRTC and see if the government\u2019s willing to play ball and do this with you, because you\u2019re right they would have to drive it.", "19642 And it has certainly been the case before that this Commission has made recommendations to government on how it should proceed on things -- even the current, you know, internet speed targets were CRTC targets and you\u2019ve suggested legislative changes that are desirable from time to time; many of which have been adopted over the course of time. ", "19643 So you\u2019re quite right. I mean it\u2019s not perhaps a completely equal role in that sense, but if you drive it in terms of recommendations and the government does come to the table, and then you get input from the other stakeholders into that process, so it\u2019s well defined transparent, clear, then the administration becomes neutral I think you\u2019ve got a pretty good model for moving forward.", "19644 Now your concern might be well this is going to take such a long time, what are we going to do?", "19645 Reality is you could start this dialog or recommendation tomorrow if you wanted to. It\u2019s not out of the realm of practice for this commission to make some recommendations or rulings from the bench. It did so, for example, in the previous CCTS review in 2011.", "19646 So to start the dialog you could start it right away. It will take some time no matter what. It will take some time even if the government acts on its own to spend this 500 million, to put in a program to do that.", "19647 It will -- it\u2019s not going to happen tomorrow anyway. We\u2019re just thinking that a coordinated approach during that period is better than an each going their own way approach.", "19648 So in other words let\u2019s converge you two as quickly as possible, get you working together, get the input from other stakeholders and move ahead.", "19649 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay thank you for that. My concern was that the sound of one hand clapping is not very loud --", "--- (LAUGHTER)", "19650 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: -- when you get through that stuff, so. ", "19651 We touched on this before, but slightly when we were talking about fibre and fixed wireless and satellite. ", "19652 What do you think -- obviously if you want 10 and 3, unless OneWeb is right, that\u2019s not going to happen for satellite and satellite served communities who -- which in general are struggling. They\u2019re sort of on the edge, geographically and in other ways, of society. Many of them anyway. Too many of them.", "19653 What would be an appropriate standard for satellite?", "19654 MR. TACIT: Well the standard for satellite may be lower and it will be whatever makes the satellite function without crippling it, I suppose, and you have to be realistic about that and we can\u2019t make policy based on speculative technology. ", "19655 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It is not good when the satellite (inaudible).", "19656 MR. TACIT: No I agree with that. ", "19657 So, you know, it can\u2019t be -- they can\u2019t be unrealistic targets. So I -- we\u2019ve already conceded that at least for a time that may be the case, but in terms of making even that capacity ---", "19658 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Five in one?", "19659 MR. TACIT: Perhaps that\u2019s useable. I\u2019m hoping that they would -- the satellite people would agree with that target. If not I think they should really have to demonstrate technologically why that\u2019s not appropriate. ", "19660 The onus should be on them to demonstrate, at least that much, given that 5/1 is sort of the minimum national conversation we\u2019ve been having. ", "19661 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And these targets you would see with that exception, applying equally to urban core and rural remote areas?", "19662 MR. TACIT: Yes. ", "19663 There are other problems to be solves, like, as we mentioned with transport in the north relative to other types of focus in the south and so on.", "19664 And a lot of these would go into helping create more usable and affordable internet for people, but there will be some technological constraints based on, you know, if you\u2019re using satellite or not. There\u2019s no way around that. ", "19665 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: When it comes to funding, Canada Connects and other and subsidy, there\u2019s been quite a bit of discussion the last -- particularly the last few days about funding transport as a preferred -- and perhaps Canada Connects and other funds would be more efficient if that was the focus of the funding. I\u2019d like your view on that issue. ", "19666 MR. TACIT: I think here we separate what we call the north and although we focused largely our comments on Northwestel we can see that there may be other parts of the north that go into, you know, the northern parts of provinces that have similar very high cost characteristics that might need this approach.", "19667 But the north requires a lot of focus on transport, because transport is very expensive, much more expensive by orders of magnitude sometimes hundreds and tens of orders of magnitude compared to the south to be able to get.", "19668 And without that transport it\u2019s very hard to develop a more competitive marketplace that will actually help consumers and push technological advancement in the long run. So that is one consideration. ", "19669 In the south the transport issue is, as we see it, where prices can still be high but for other reasons, I think those are more issues of premature forbearance in some routes.", "19670 Where in fact, because we are working with an outdated forbearance test, and because we don\u2019t know in some cases that we have competitive choices because we don\u2019t know who\u2019s there in terms of transport because we don\u2019t have the maps, we can run into inefficiency for service providers that want to offer competitive services. ", "19671 So I think the solutions are a little bit different in each case. And it stems from this order of magnitude difference in cost and the different environments.", "19672 Where you, in the south, do have more duplicated facilities and you need to know where that is and you need to focus on, you know, seeing if you need to modify the forbearance test if there isn\u2019t enough duplication on certain routes of really high speed capacity. ", "19673 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So in terms of that northern transport subsidy, it would be primarily focused on the establishment of transport networks or would it be a cost subsidy to access existing transport networks?", "19674 MR. TACIT: It -- basically the idea that we proposed -- and I think SSI had a very similar proposal quite in parallel, which is interesting because I guess it shows you that there\u2019s a commonality of what -- of the perception of the problem, is that you would have subsidized rates for transport. ", "19675 Now the difference between us and SSI, is SSI focused more on the terrestrial Northwestel transport and we are focusing, I believe, more on both the terrestrial and the satellite piece.", "19676 So there would have to be a mechanism found to transfer the existing subsidies, the SIP and the PEZ(Ph) subsidies, into -- roll those into instead a transport subsidy, then you would attract other parties to come in using those transport facilities at subsidized rates, wholesale rates, and they\u2019d be able to roll out the access and so on.", "19677 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And that should, by creating that theoretically -- by creating that competitive framework would allow residents of the north to have access to comparable retail rates?", "19678 MR. TACIT: Yes, certainly pricing. Like -- now we may still have some technological constraints in terms of speeds and so on, as I mentioned, but it will certainly help bring down prices quite a bit if you have -- if you took that approach, we believe.", "19679 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay, one of the impacts of that, the way I understood it when you outlined it, was you\u2019d be looking at transferring the existing wireline subsidy into that framework and I\u2019m concerned that that would strand wireline.", "19680 MR. TACIT: And I think, you know, that\u2019s a fair observation and critique. ", "19681 And I think the way that SSI dealt with that, as I recall, is they proposed a gradual transitioning from one to the other and I think that that\u2019s probably a wise way of dealing with that in order to make sure that it doesn\u2019t overnight strand people.", "19682 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So that would be at the customer end where they could choose to remain, I mean, I -- it\u2019s very difficult to figure out how that would work for Northwestel because, for instance -- as the -- you know, the provider of, primarily, -- SSI does as well but of a voice service like that, as money moves out, I mean the cost of maintaining these networks is not insignificant in terms of that.", "19683 So how would that transfer occur?", "19684 MR. TACIT: Oh, as I\u2019m saying, it wouldn\u2019t happen in a flash cut. You\u2019d have a gradual reduction of one subsidy and a gradual increase of the other.", "19685 As you start increasing the other, you\u2019re going to start attracting other players who then are going to -- you know, be able to offer services at reduced prices at the retail end.", "19686 So I think that\u2019s ---", "19687 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Are you talking about VoIP services?", "19688 MR. TACIT: It could be VoIP. It could be -- it could be existing circuit switch that -- you know, I mean I think the technologies will evolve to fill the need and people will buy whatever they think is most efficient for them.", "19689 The reality is that, you know, the wireline business is in decline everywhere and VoIP is increasing much more quickly than -- so it\u2019s where the market is headed.", "19690 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I know. It\u2019s a little bit like trying to whip the tablecloth off and not spill the wine at the same time.", "19691 MR. TACIT: I agree we have to find a way to do it to calibrate it in a delicate way, but it doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do it.", "19692 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: In terms of adoptability, it was one of the issues that was presented to us. What do you think -- what role do you think your members play in advancing the cause of adoptability throughout the country, encouraging people to access networks, signing new people up as opposed to existing ---", "19693 MR. TACIT: Well, look we compete for people\u2019s business, so we go after every possible customer which I guess increases adoption, right?", "19694 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Let me put it this way; is it better with you or without you?", "19695 MR. TACIT: Well ---", "19696 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I know the answer to that, so that\u2019s a fat pitch. So go ahead, swing for the fences.", "19697 MR. TACIT: Well, I certainly appreciate having this client, I can tell you that.", "19698 But no, I think, you know, we provide value to consumers. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We believe we fill a niche that others -- incumbents in particular don\u2019t, and people vote with their wallets and come to us for that reason, and that increases adoption.", "19699 The other thing we do -- and this is important and it also ties in to an earlier question of yours, by providing lower cost alternatives, you\u2019ll see that a lot of the customers of CNOC members are people who care a lot. They\u2019re very price sensitive.", "19700 Now, whether that\u2019s because of their income or for other reasons, we don\u2019t know, but they are -- they are factually very price sensitive.", "19701 So we provide that option. Perhaps the people who might choose to not have a permanent home connection and rely solely on a mobile phone or something in a less optimal solution. ", "19702 And it\u2019s also that price sensitivity that is one of the reasons, you know, we said that this whole notion of a skinny internet package is problematic because it increases other prices along the way for packages that people might need.", "19703 MR. HICKEY: If I could just add for one second. I just want to build on the niche comments.", "19704 You know, many of our members pride themselves on finding a market that is either -- and not using the same terms as we\u2019re talking today, but just un-marketed to, unserved as from a direct kind of marketing campaign, whether it be a language or a culture or a, you know, place in town or a very technically -- technically- minded, and they drive towards those communities.", "19705 And you see some responses that maybe you don\u2019t get from just a broad based type marketing. ", "19706 And so by driving to those niches you can also ensure that adoption also grows as people find a company that they can respond to and want to make their service provider.", "19707 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. Speaking of price sensitivity, I think I asked this earlier and to be fair I will ask you as well, not to be repetitive but to be fair.", "19708 Various folks have come before us with good intentions and great ambitions from time to time. And as I was saying earlier, at the end of the first week, we were looking at average internet bills maybe going up by $2. By the end of the second week, it was 5. And then we were talking 8 to 10 earlier this week.", "19709 What sort of tolerance do you think there is among your customers and clients for increases on their internet bills in order to fund and address some of the issues we\u2019ve been talking about?", "19710 MR. HICKEY: Yeah, it\u2019s one that we -- that\u2019s difficult for us because a lot of our -- a lot of our members offer highly competitive rates in the market today. And we went through them a little bit ago where they\u2019re already significantly low.", "19711 And a lot of their customers, as Chris was talking before, are just very price sensitive. And $1 to $2 may not sound very much, but it does make an impact or a difference to a very price-sensitive customer.", "19712 And then you can\u2019t really add that on by -- you can\u2019t look at it as a silo because costs are generally rising. So it\u2019s not just a \u201clet\u2019s do this with a 1 to 2, let alone a $5 to $10 increase.\u201d", "19713 So it\u2019s difficult to look at it as a silo, especially when 48 percent of Canadians have already responded that they don\u2019t like the price of their existing service.", "19714 And I would also just be remiss to say we\u2019ve looked at adding these types of charges before. We\u2019ve recently dealt with paper bills that people didn\u2019t like having an additional bill charge. So those were addressed. And the passing through of the Local Programming Improvement Fund, when that occurred, there was customer outcry on that front.", "19715 So I think when you look at quantums of similar situations we\u2019ve been through, there is quite a large amount of sensitivity to even $1 to $2-type rate increases.", "19716 MR. TACIT: And just to add to that, and I fear that we are on the higher side, not the $1 and $2 side, particularly if we want to have a more robust longer-term solution for Canadians. Which is why we are much more focused on a government broadly based tax driven solution than what we can do in the closed system of the telecom industry to fund this.", "19717 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So the solution -- your recommendation, as I take it from your oral presentation, is Ms. Hamilton\u2019s advice to have the federal government, which has the power to tax everything, take it on in order to fund these subsidies?", "19718 MS. HAMILTON: That\u2019s true.", "19719 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Except in the Northwestel case, where you want a transfer of existing subsidy.", "19720 MS. HAMILTON: Industry will come to the table and we\u2019ll partner on the projects, but there needs to be a significant influx of cash from the federal government and a long-term strategy to take us where we need to go.", "19721 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So is the 500 million in current federal funding, is that sufficient to get this done, given that it\u2019s over five years? And if yes, it\u2019s one thing. If no, how much should it be?", "19722 MR. TACIT: Well, we\u2019ve seen the numbers from a lot of parties and, as I said, because we -- you know, we are of the view that we want the solution to be a longer-term solution and not just be sort of doing it in increments, we think some of the larger numbers are probably more accurate.", "19723 We haven\u2019t been able to quantify it ourselves precisely but we think that -- and that\u2019s our fear that we do think some of the larger numbers are the correct numbers and that that\u2019s beyond the capacity of the industry to deal with, without significant market distortion, which we would want to avoid.", "19724 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So even if we went with Bell said 1.7 billion, OpenMedia said 2 billion, but that number was a little old. But going all Carl Sagan on you, it\u2019s billions and billions, right?", "19725 MR. TACIT: Yeah.", "19726 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So 3, something like that, so ---", "19727 MR. TACIT: It\u2019s still ---", "19728 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Putting that in context with $100 million a year, right?", "19729 MR. TACIT: Exactly.", "19730 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: And but there is matching private investment that goes along with this.", "19731 MR. TACIT: Absolutely. Nobody is saying that this is 100 percent funded with -- and that\u2019s why we say -- that\u2019s why Lynne said, you know, we\u2019re coming -- we\u2019d come to the table as willing partners. But these are cases that, by definition, without some assistance, you know, require help.", "19732 Bill has had some firsthand experience. Perhaps he can share that with you.", "19733 MR. SANDIFORD: When you asked the first question, is the 500 million enough, I mean I was simply going to say no, it\u2019s not.", "19734 We saw -- the original program for \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d was highly contested with a lot of projects that did not get funded, that could have funded other parts of the country, simply because there just wasn\u2019t enough funds available.", "19735 You know, the number is in the billions of billions of dollars and it\u2019s going to take some time and there will be matching funds to help match that.", "19736 There\u2019s a lot of people who are willing to invest and invest heavily but the matching funds need to be there.", "19737 MS. HAMILTON: And all I would say is that by using the model that we're putting forward, you can assume that you're going to get the best bang for your buck and you're going to get it where you need it, as opposed to where folks want to give it.", "19738 MR. SANDIFORD: The other thing that I thought I'd mention as well too is that the 500 million that's been recently announced, to my knowledge, there hasn\u2019t been a declaration yet that there is matching funds attached to that. I mean we're using that base on the assumption that the last 300 million had matching funds.", "19739 But there's no -- there's no sense of exactly how that 500 million is going to be deployed as of yet. We don\u2019t know that it's going to have matching funds with it.", "19740 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Okay. So the sky is the limit, right? I mean we all have to be reasonable but a doubling of -- I mean if you wanted to get there quickly, it would take a doubling of that investment. Would that be fair to say?", "19741 MR. SANDIFORD: Yeah.", "19742 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: I mean the world is changing very quickly. That's -- I mean that's been made clear to us by many that, you know -- and it's been made clear too that these funds have been effective and there's, you know, hundreds of thousands of homes served that weren\u2019t five years ago. But, you know, when we said 5 and 1 five years ago, people thought, \u201cWell, you'll never get there\u201d and, I mean, we didn't get all the way there but we got way passed -- I mean, demand grew and government shifted and made it more necessary to have -- I mean, a lot has changed in a very short period of time.", "19743 So if we wanted to address the concerns of those who had said that Canada is just going to slip farther behind, this would be the time to be very aggressive about this build.", "19744 MR. TACIT: Yeah, absolutely, it would be. And, you know, I think we're at an inflection point at a country. You know, there's been I think perhaps not enough attention given to our national productivity and, in fact, one the mandates this Commission has is to promote the efficiency of telecommunications, both nationally and internationally, not to mention the internal productivity that can be leveraged.", "19745 This is a very analogous project to, you know, the railways of the 1800\u2019s and it could be just as beneficial in terms of its impact for just as long if we get it right and do it quickly. Or else, we could be bypassed by those who do it and be left behind and that's why we're concerned.", "19746 When we say that, you know, you folks have great ability to collect the data that's compelling about what it costs, where it's needed, how such a transparent program might be designed, the federal government, you know, has the authority to come out and actually create the program and to fund it, and it needs that broad-based funding. We just can't do it entirely out of the pockets of this industry to achieve those objectives.", "19747 MS. HAMILTON: And I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t say we appreciate the federal government making that investment. Like that's huge. There are many competing political priorities and others throughout the country and we are grateful that they recognize that but the problem is great and the challenge ahead of us is huge. And if you're going to put a strategy together, let's be forward thinking and figure out what we -- where the puck is headed, not where it is today.", "19748 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: So this is probably my last question but you never know. I've put this out before sort of for pressing issues in front of us. The north which we -- Northwestel territory basically plus Katimavik, filling the gap in those sort of semi-rural, sub-rural territories, other remote and First Nations communities, and affordability. So how do we prioritize those? Which do you think should be first?", "19749 MR. HICKEY: It's a very difficult question, to be perfectly honest, but ---", "19750 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: You can disagree with the question and say ---", "19751 MR. HICKEY: Oh, no, if I were to take the \u201cwe should leave no one behind\u201d ---", "19752 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It can\u2019t be possibly ranked and -- but I just want to get your perceptions on that.", "19753 MR. HICKEY: It's one of the hard realities that we have to face as we go forward to deploy.", "19754 You know, I think as we look at things, there's, you know, critical areas where broadband as a quality of life is very important and you mentioned things like First Nations and things like their, I would say, kind of critical infrastructure in many ways that they're lacking now. We think that one is very important and that kind of follows the line with places without connectivity. So that's kind of the types that we would say we need to focus on those first where there's either absence and it's a critical issue, or absence and you have no connectivity. And let's fill those gaps first.", "19755 Following that, I think then you'd have to look at the issues of affordability. I mean we understand that affordability is a concern but that one, we have to make sure we get everyone connected first I think before we can start saying we need to start addressing items such affordability, because affordability really only matters once you have connectivity and there's places out there have no connectivity and wished in many ways they could have an affordability problem.", "19756 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: It's very inexpensive when you don\u2019t have it.", "19757 MR. HICKEY: Yes, exactly. Oh, yes, or costly I guess as Lynne would say. So I know that doesn't give you a one, two, three, but that's kind of -- we're very sensitive to affordability but we just think that has to become after we get people connected.", "19758 MR. TACIT: And we did also, as part of our position, you know, indicate that most of these facilities should be subject to a wholesale access obligation. So in terms of the affordability component, the competitive aspect would also look -- help look after that once people are connected or have their improved facilities in place.", "19759 COMMISSIONER MENZIES: Thank you. Those are my questions and the broadening of your wingspan was noted at today\u2019s meeting as well. So thank you. My colleagues might have some questions.", "19760 THE CHAIRPERSON: Apparently not. So those are all our questions and I do want to thank you for your participation in the hearing. It is valuable and very much appreciated.", "19761 I have checked with the Secretary and apparently she doesn't have any final comments.", "19762 Alors, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 moi de clore l\u2019audience et, avant de conclure cette audience, permettez-moi de remercier diverses personnes qui ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette importante audience.", "19763 Premi\u00e8rement, je voudrais souligner le travail des interpr\u00e8tes et des st\u00e9nographes qui s\u2019assurent que rien ne se -- que rien de ce qui est dit en cours d\u2019audience n'est perdu, y compris la fa\u00e7on que je viens de lire cette phrase.", "19764 Un merci \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe de CPAC qui a diffus\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente audience sur leur site web.", "19765 I would also like to thank all the reporters, bloggers, and social media users who bring the hearing beyond these walls and into the digital world so that those who can\u2019t attend or participate directly can still keep up with the hearing as it unfolds.", "19766 But please remember, in order for your views to be considered, they must be on the public record. I want to thank everyone who has participated in our online discussion forum throughout the hearing. Your voices have been heard and put on the record.", "19767 D\u2019ailleurs, il nous reste encore quelques heures pour partager vos opinions sur le forum en ligne qui sera disponible jusqu\u2019\u00e0 20 heures ce soir, heure de l\u2019Est.", "19768 Je voudrais \u00e9galement remercier mes coll\u00e8gues du panel qui se d\u00e9vouent \u00e0 plein lors de chacune des audiences auxquelles ils participent.

Vos conseils sont toujours d'une grande aide pour le panel dans sa prise de d\u00e9cision. Merci \u00e0 vous tous.", "19770 But I would like to give a particular thank to those Canadians who answered our invitation to come to the table to share their views. And I mean here both the witness table, the physical table in front of us, but also the notional table of our various submissions we received through both analog and digital channels.", "19771 As I mentioned at the beginning of the second week of this hearing, the Panel acknowledged that broadband is vital to economic, social, democratic, and cultural success of individuals and communities. So, in a sense, we're taking that vitality as a given.", "19772 In doing so, the Panel reframed the focus of proceeding, called on parties to explore the elements that should be included in a national broadband strategy for Canada.", "19773 I also mentioned that this is possibly our best last chance to create together a national broadband strategy through an open and transparent process, based on evidence from Canadians, to achieve it, to the extent possible, through consensus and implement it through shared responsibility.", "19774 But I remind everyone although I\u2019ve used the word \u201cstrategy\u201d, strategy comes with action. We are looking for concrete actions to move forward.", "19775 Nous devons maintenant nous pencher sur la grande quantit\u00e9 de renseignements obtenus au cours de cette instance publique, et ultimement parvenir \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions. \u00c9videmment, toute information soumise sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e avec soin.", "19776 J\u2019en profite \u00e9galement pour rappeler \u00e0 toutes les parties qu\u2019il y a eu des changements dans les dates limites pr\u00e9vues pour les soumissions des r\u00e9pliques.", "19777 In order to provide parties with additional times to review new information that will be added to the record of this proceeding and provide their views on a national broadband action strategy for Canada, the deadline for filing the final written submissions have been extended to May 25", "th", ", 2016, and, in addition, parties will be provided with the opportunity to file final reply comments by June 13", "th", ", 2016.", "19778 This is not about filing new evidence.
