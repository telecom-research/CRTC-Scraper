AT&T Canada stated that it wanted the Commission to substitute for those terms and conditions of its current access agreement with the City that are inconsistent with the principles set out in Decision CRTC 2001-23, Ledcor/Vancouver - Construction, operation and maintenance of transmission lines in Vancouver, dated 25 January 2001, the terms and conditions that are based on the principles set out in that decision.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                     \r\n                     \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              2.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              On 27 June 2001, the City filed its response to AT&T Canada's application. The City argued that the principles developed in Decision 2001-23 were not applicable in the unique factual circumstances of the contractual situation between itself and AT&T Canada. Further, the City argued that the Commission lacked jurisdiction under the Act to interfere with an existing agreement for access to municipal property like the agreement between itself and AT&T Canada.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                     \r\n                     \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              Scope of proceeding\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                     \r\n                     \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              3.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              In this proceeding, the Commission will consider, given the framework set out in sections 43(1) to 43(4) and any other relevant provisions of the Act, and the principles laid out in Decision 2001-23, what circumstances, if any, would justify an intervention by the Commission to alter the terms of an existing contract between a carrier and a municipality for access to municipal rights-of-way.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                     \r\n                     \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              Procedure\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                     \r\n                     \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              4.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              The contract filed in the Part VII application as Appendix \"A\" to AT&T Canada's application is made part of the record in this proceeding.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                     \r\n                     \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              5.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              AT&T Canada and the City are made parties to this proceeding.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                     \r\n                     \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              6.\r\n                           \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                           \r\n                              Other parties wishing to participate in this proceeding must notify the Commission of their intention to do so by 1 October 2001.
