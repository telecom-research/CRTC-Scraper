Decision CRTC 97-626 Decision Ottawa, 6 November 1997 Decision CRTC 97-626 Fairchild Radio (Vancouver FM) Ltd. Vancouver, British Columbia - 199701024 Increase in power for CHKG-FM 1.  Following Public Notice CRTC 1997-116 dated 3 September 1997, the Commission approves the application to amend the broadcasting licence for the radio programming undertaking CHKG-FM Vancouver by increasing the effective radiated power from 40,000 watts to 46,000 watts. 2.  Approval for this new undertaking was granted in Decision CRTC 96-288 dated 29 July 1996. The transmitting parameters in the original application were based on using the CFMI-FM New Westminster transmitter site. However, subsequent measurements have shown that alternative transmitting arrangements were necessary. 3.  The Commission notes that the licensee proposes to relocate the transmitter to a site approximately 300 metres to the northwest for which no approval is required. The Commission also notes that according to the licensee's statement, there will be no change in the proposed coverage in the populated service areas of the station. 4.  The Department of Industry has advised the Commission that this application is conditionally technically acceptable, and that a Broadcasting Certificate will only be issued once it has been determined that the proposed technical parameters will not create any unacceptable interference with aeronautical NAV/COM services. 5.  In accordance with subsection 22(1) of the Broadcasting Act , the Commission will only issue the licence amendment, and the authority will only be granted, at such time as written notification is received from the Department of Industry that its technical requirements have been met, and that a Broadcasting Certificate will be issued. This decision is to be appended to the licence. Laura M. Talbot-Allan Secretary General This document is available in alternative format upon request.

Background 1. On 28 May 2001, AT&T Canada Corp. on behalf of itself and AT&T Canada Telecom Services Company (AT&T Canada) filed a Part VII application requesting relief pursuant to sections 32(d) and (e) and 43(4) of the Telecommunications Act (the Act), naming the City of Toronto (the City) as respondent. AT&T Canada stated that it wanted the Commission to substitute for those terms and conditions of its current access agreement with the City that are inconsistent with the principles set out in Decision CRTC 2001-23 , Ledcor/Vancouver - Construction, operation and maintenance of transmission lines in Vancouver, dated 25 January 2001, the terms and conditions that are based on the principles set out in that decision. 2. On 27 June 2001, the City filed its response to AT&T Canada's application. The City argued that the principles developed in Decision 2001-23 were not applicable in the unique factual circumstances of the contractual situation between itself and AT&T Canada. Further, the City argued that the Commission lacked jurisdiction under the Act to interfere with an existing agreement for access to municipal property like the agreement between itself and AT&T Canada. Scope of proceeding 3. In this proceeding, the Commission will consider, given the framework set out in sections 43(1) to 43(4) and any other relevant provisions of the Act, and the principles laid out in Decision 2001-23 , what circumstances, if any, would justify an intervention by the Commission to alter the terms of an existing contract between a carrier and a municipality for access to municipal rights-of-way. Procedure 4. The contract filed in the Part VII application as Appendix ""A"" to AT&T Canada's application is made part of the record in this proceeding. 5. AT&T Canada and the City are made parties to this proceeding. 6. Other parties wishing to participate in this proceeding must notify the Commission of their intention to do so by 1 October 2001. These parties should contact the Secretary General, by mail at CRTC, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0N2; by fax at (819) 953-0795; or by email at procedure@crtc.gc.ca. They are to indicate in the notice their email address, where available. If parties do not have access to the Internet, they are to indicate in their notice whether they wish to receive disk versions of hard copy filings. 7. The Commission will issue, as soon as possible after the registration date, a complete list of interested parties and their mailing addresses (including their email address, if available), identifying those parties who wish to receive disk versions. 8. All parties may submit comments on the circumstances, if any, for Commission intervention, serving a copy of their submission on all the parties on the interested parties list, by 29 October 2001. Submissions longer than five pages should include a summary. In order to streamline the process and reduce the workload for all concerned, the Commission encourages parties with similar interests to file joint submissions and to participate jointly in subsequent stages of the proceeding. 9. Parties may file reply comments with the Commission, serving a copy on those parties who filed comments, by 28 November 2001. Submissions longer than five pages should include a summary. 10. Where a document is to be filed or served by a specific date, the document must be actually received, and not merely sent, by that date. 11. Parties wishing to file electronic versions of their comments can do so by email at the address shown above, or on diskette. 12. The electronic version should be in the HTML format. As an alternative, those submitting comments may use ""Microsoft Word"" for text and ""Microsoft Excel"" for spreadsheets. 13. Please number each paragraph of your submission. In addition, please enter the line ***End of document*** following the last paragraph. This will help the Commission verify that the document has not been damaged during transmission. 14. The Commission will make submissions filed in electronic form available on its web site at www.crtc.gc.ca in the official language and format in which they are submitted. This will make it easier for members of the public to consult the documents. 15. The Commission also encourages interested parties to monitor the public examination file (and/or the Commission's web site) for additional information that they may find useful when preparing their submission. 16.

Across Canada  Application 2005-0033-1 Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2005-53 19 May 2005  Hustler TV and X Channel - Amendment to the definition of broadcast day 1. The Commission approves the application by Ten Broadcasting Inc. to amend the definition of the term ""broadcast day"" for the purposes of the conditions of licence for the national English-language Category 2 specialty programming undertakings known as Hustler TV and X Channel. 2. The Commission did not receive any interventions in connection with this application. 3. The broadcast day for both Hustler TV and X Channel is currently defined as the 24-hour period beginning at 6:00 a.m. each day. The licensee requested that the definition of the broadcast day for each of these undertakings be amended, effective 1 November 2004, to mean a 24-hour period beginning at midnight (00:00) each day. 4. In accordance with its usual practice for amendments to the definition of broadcast day, the Commission finds that it is appropriate to implement the revised definition, effective 1 September 2005. Accordingly, the definition of the broadcast day for the purposes of both Hustler TV's and X Channel's conditions of licence will read as follows:  Beginning 1 September 2005, ""broadcast day"" means a 24-hour period beginning each day at midnight (00:00), or any other period approved by the Commission. 5. In approving this application, the Commission has taken into account the fact that the revised definition of the broadcast day will not adversely affect the conditions of licence pertaining to Hustler TV's and X Channel's nature of service or any other of their conditions of licence.

It is submitted to the Commission in a specific format and sent to the program logs filing website. 2.      Within 30 days after the end of each month, licensees of television programming services must file with the Commission the program log or computer record for that month and a certificate attesting to the accuracy of its contents signed by the licensee or a representative. Current procedures 3.      Under the Commission’s current procedures, licensees that fail to meet the regulatory requirements for logging receive a letter of non-compliance from Commission staff requesting the submission of the appropriate logs. If the non-compliance continues after the receipt of this letter, licensees receive further letters from Commission staff again requesting the submission of the appropriate logs. New approach 4.      Following a review of its procedures, the Commission has decided to modify its approach to non-compliance with logging requirements. Specifically, Commission staff will continue to send a first letter to licensees that do not meet these requirements. However, if a licensee remains in non-compliance, the Commission will send a second letter signed by the Secretary General. This second letter will stipulate that the licensee is in breach of its regulatory requirements and: must submit the required logs within 30 days from the date of the letter and describe the steps taken to ensure future compliance; and may be subject to one or more regulatory sanctions should it fail to submit the required information. 5.      The above-noted regulatory sanctions could include: returning future applications of any type by the licensee in non-compliance  concerning any current or proposed services, including applications for new Category B licences and extensions of deadlines for beginning the operation of new Category B services, as well as Part 1 and licence renewal applications; imposing a condition of licence requiring the licensee to contribute towards a new or existing independent Canadian production fund; and initiating a mandatory order proceeding. 6.      In the case of a licensee that is in non-compliance as of the date of this information bulletin and has failed to respond within the allotted time to a non-compliance letter from Commission staff, the Commission will immediately issue a letter from the Secretary General indicating that the licensee has 60 days to submit the appropriate logs. If the licensee fails to do so, it may be subject to one or more of the above-noted sanctions. 7.      Licensees are also advised that the Commission will note any non-compliance with regulatory requirements in the next renewal decision for the affected television services. Such non-compliance could result in a short-term renewal.
