    "While the raw data from word frequency counts is compelling, it does little but describe quantitative features of the corpus. In order to determine if the statistics are indicative of a trend in word usage we must add value to the word frequencies. In this exercise we will produce a ratio of the occurences of `privacy` to the number of words in the entire corpus. Then we will compare the occurences of `privacy` to the indivudal number of transcripts within the corpus. This data will allow us identify trends that are worthy of further investigation.\n",

There is a clear indication that the usage of the term `privacy` is increasing, with major changes occuring between the years 2008 and 2009, as well as between 2012 and 2014. This trend is also clearly obervable between the 39th and 40th sittings of Parliament. "
