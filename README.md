# CRTC Text Analysis

This is the webpage and code repository for a research project about the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC. 

This project has three distinct components: a collection of web scraping code, using the Python package Scrapy; a collection of Jupyter Notebooks containing the text analysis code; and a collection of Jeykll code which builds the project webpage.

The text analysis was performed on text scraped from the CRTC webpage, which currently includes the transcripts of hearings held between April 11-28, 2016. The purpose of these hearings was [“To consider the review of basic telecommunications services”](http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/transcripts/2016/index.htm).

A summary of the text analysis can be found on the [project webpage](https://telecom-research.github.io/crtc-scraper/).
