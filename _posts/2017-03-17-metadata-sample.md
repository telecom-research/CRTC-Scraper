title: Sample of CRTC metadata output
---

The following is a sample of the metadata output obtained from scraping some recent documents posted by the CRTC. The information is in the `json` format, which is a flexible `xml` type file format that allows for the navigation of unstructured or inconsistent data. 

This sample contains information that is not visible on the CRTC webpage, illustrated here by the field `keywords`. The next step for this scraping project is capturing the actual content of the page. There is a slight challenge here in terms of accurately recording the paragraph numbers, but so far the progress has been promising.
