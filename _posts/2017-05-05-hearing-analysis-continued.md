---

This is a continuation of the text analysis performed on a series of transcripts published by the CRTC between April 11 and April 28, 2016.

This analysis will look at the following words: 

- broadband
- fibre

### Key Findings of the Analysis

#### BROADBAND

The word `broadband` and its variations appear with the greatest frequency in the transcript dated April 11, 2015.

After removing stopwords and lemmatizing the text, `broadband` occurs a total of `1143` times across all of the transcripts.

Here is a list of the most significant collocated words appearing with `broadband` using the Log-likelihood ratio.

The word most significantly collocated with `broadband` is `national`, followed by `strategy` and `access`. It is extremely important to note here that **words will appear twice** in the following list. As the ngrams can appear both before and after the word, care must be taken to identify duplicate occurrences in the list below and then combine the totals. Therefore, the list below is a sample. Please refer to the notebook for the complete list, and calculate accordingly.
